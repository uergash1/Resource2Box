GX061-36-10364993	U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  Office of Community Planning and Development           Consolidated Plan Contact    CITIZEN'S SUMMARY   San Bernardino County is located approximately 60 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean and extends to Arizona and Nevada.  Covering 20,000 square miles, San Bernardino County has the largest land area of any county in the continental United States, larger than the states of Rhode Island, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland, Hawaii, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont.  Between 1970 and 1980 the population more than doubled, rising from 684,072 to 1.4 million.  The County consists of three geographically distinct areas -- the Inland Valley, the San Gabriel/San Bernardino Mountains and the Mojave Desert.     The County of San Bernardino is a qualified urban county entitled to receive Federal Housing and Community Development Grant funds from HUD as a consortium of unincorporated communities and 17 cooperating cities.  The cooperating cities are Adelanto, Town of Apple Valley, Barstow, Big Bear Lake, Chino Hills, Colton, Grand Terrace, Highland, Yucaipa, Victorville and the Town of Yucca Valley.  The County Consortium represents 53 percent of the total County population.  The remaining cities in the County (Chino, Fontana, Hesperia, Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga, San Bernardino and Upland) qualify as entitlement cities and have chosen to participate directly with HUD.   Action Plan   In Fiscal Year 1995-96, the County Consortium will use $16 million in Federal funds to implement a strategy that will provide additional affordable housing and community development projects.  These funds include over $12 million in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, $3.3 million in HOME investment Partnership (HOME) funds, and $.3 million in Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) funds.   Citizen Participation   To encourage citizen participation, the County Department of Economic and Community Development (ECD) asked each of the 17 municipalities participating in the County Consortium to conduct at least one community forum to identify housing and community development needs.  The forums were designed to gather citizen input on programs that might benefit each community's lower income residents.  During November and December 1994, 17 separate forums were held throughout the County, and the overall attendance exceeded 330.   During the same period, surveys were mailed to the eight entitlement cities within the County.  San Bernardino County consulted with neighboring counties to solicit input from jurisdictions that might overlap or otherwise affect its programs.  The County also consulted with 24 county departments, 106 community-based organizations, 189 organizations providing services to the homeless, and residents of public and Section 8 housing.   The identified needs were summarized in a report presented to the Board of Supervisors.  This report determined the priority needs, objectives, and actions listed in the Consolidated Plan.          COMMUNITY PROFILE   Sixty miles inland from the Pacific Ocean, San Bernardino County borders the north and east metropolitan areas of Orange and Los Angeles counties. Like other counties in Southern California, San Bernardino has experienced rapid growth during the past two decades. Between 1970 and 1990, the population increased by more than 107 percent, rising from 684,072 to 1.4 million.   The county's population growth has been affected by the economies of Orange and Los Angeles Counties and has been concentrated in areas adjacent to these jurisdictions or within commuting distance to them. Additional growth can be attributed to immigration from Mexico, Latin America, and the Pacific Rim.   The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) projects that the county's population growth will continue. SCAG is predicting a 54-percent increase between 1990 and 2010. During this same period, the number of housing units is expected to increase by 77 percent, while employment is expected to increase by 73 percent.   The 1990 census reported that the county's median age was almost 28. Adults between the ages of 25 and 54 comprise 43 percent of the population. School age children between the ages of 5 and 18 comprise nearly 23 percent. Elderly persons over the age of 65 comprise less than 9 percent.    The racial and ethnic composition of the entire county changed significantly during the past decade. The white non-Hispanic population decreased, falling from 73 percent in 1980 to 61 percent in 1990. The Hispanic population increased, rising from 18.5 percent to 26 percent. Although the overall proportions of African Americans and Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders are small, these groups increased by 137 percent and by 273 percent, respectively.    The estimated 1994 median family income (MCI) for the Riverside-San Bernardino County metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was $42,300, slightly higher than the national average but lower than MCI for Orange ($59,100) and Los Angeles ($45,200) Counties. In 1990 about 12 percent of the county's households were extremely low-income (0-30 percent of MCI); 11 percent were low-income (31-50 percent of MCI); 17 percent were moderate- income (51-80 percent of MCI); and 8 percent were middle-income (81-95 percent of MCI). Nearly 25 percent of all households in the county were in the low-income category, and 57 percent of those households lived in County Consortium areas.         HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT NEEDS   Conditions   According to the 1990 census, 465,877 households reside in San Bernardino County, a countrywide increase of 56,566 since 1980. Of these, 254,935 households (more than 50 percent) live in the County Consortium area. Overall, the average household size has increased from 2.8 persons in 1980 to 3.4 in 1990.   The 1990 census indicated that San Bernardino County had 588,501 housing units. Of these, 67 percent were single-family dwellings, and 25 percent were multifamily dwellings.   The county's vacancy rate was 18 percent. However, this high figure can be attributed to the California recession and to the large number of seasonal units, which account for 33 percent of all vacant units. Furthermore, 16,507 vacant units were for sale.   The housing stock is relatively new. Nearly 50 percent all units were built between 1980 and 1989; 33 percent of the units were built between 1960 and 1979; and 21 percent were built before 1960. Less than 2 percent of the stock is substandard and not suitable for habitation.   Housing Needs   The 1988 a State-mandated Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) prepared by SCAG estimated that between 1988 and 1994, the county would need to provide an additional 55,886 housing units to accommodate projected population growth.    The 1990 census found that 47,489 households (10 percent) are overcrowded. Nearly 60 percent of all large renter households live in overcrowded conditions.    Housing Market Conditions   Despite low interest rates and low housing prices, real estate sales remain sluggish in Southern California and in San Bernardino County. Since 1990 the real estate market has been stimulated by job market recovery, declining home prices, and increasing affordability levels. Moreover, population growth and years of recession have created a pent-up demand for housing. However, lingering anxiety about employment stability and fears that housing prices may fall further continue to depress the market.   In 1994 home prices for the area averaged $148,198, falling by 1 percent since 1993 and by 15 percent since 1991. Also during 1994, resale prices averaged $132,563, falling by 2.2 percent since 1993 and by 7.7 percent since 1991.   The closing of Norton and George Air Force Bases in San Bernardino County and the realignment of March Air Force Base in neighboring Riverside County has profoundly impacted the county's housing market.   Affordable Housing Needs   Housing affordability is the overwhelming problem facing many San Bernardino County households. Predictably, lower income households and renters most often experience housing cost burdens. Of all households, 165,559 (35 percent) are cost-burdened, paying more than 30 percent of their gross income for housing expenses. Of these, 45 percent are renters, while the remainder are homeowners. Among extremely low-income households, 75 percent are cost-burdened, paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing, and 61 percent are severely cost-burdened, paying more than 50 percent. Among low-income households, two-thirds are cost-burdened, paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing, and one-third are severely cost-burdened, paying more than 50 percent. Overall, cost burdens affect more renters than owners.    Although 85 percent of African American and 89 percent of Hispanic renter households report housing problems, those ethnic groups are not disproportionately represented among the lower income groups experiencing housing problems.   Homeless Needs   In conjunction with the Homeless Coalition, the County has identified 3,081 homeless persons, with nearly half of them being children. Of the total homeless population, 45 percent are females, and 20 percent of all homeless households are headed by women. African Americans comprise 20 percent of the homeless population but only 8 percent of the county's total population. The most frequently cited causes of homelessness include evictions, job loss, and alcohol and drug abuse.   The San Bernardino County Homeless Coalition lists 37 homeless service providers and 8 homeless shelters within the county. Several county departments also provide shelter assistance for the homeless and homeless people with mental illness.   Public and Assisted Housing Needs   The Housing Authority of San Bernardino owns and manages 12 public housing sites containing 2,018 units, which can be occupied by extremely low- and low-income households.   Currently, 1,877 applicants are on the waiting list for public housing units in County Consortium jurisdictions. A waiting period that can last between 2 and 3 years discourages many interested and eligible families from applying for the units. The Housing Authority has not received allocations to develop additional public housing units since 1988.    The Housing Authority also assists approximately 2,400 low-income households living in the County Consortium area using its Section 8 certificate and voucher program. In mid-1994, 3,961 applicants appeared on the waiting list for Section 8 assistance.   Of the 32 housing projects built by private developers who used Federal housing assistance, 4 projects in the County Consortium area will be eligible for repayment by 2000, relieving their owners from reserving units for lower income residents.    Through its Multifamily Mortgage Revenue Bond Program, the county has provided nearly 1,600 affordable units. Developments financed with such assistance must reserve 20 percent of all units for families earning less than the area MCI and must limit rents to 30 percent of gross income. The county offers mortgage revenue bonds to finance housing construction, using a program that assists low-and moderate-income homebuyers. San Bernardino County also grants a density bonus to developers who reserve 25 percent of all units for lower income households.   Barriers to Affordable Housing   The basic factors that might constrain affordable housing -- such as land use controls, building codes, processing procedures, and development fees -- do not significantly impede the expansion of the county's affordable housing supply. Sufficient land is available to accommodate the projections of the 1988 SCAG housing needs assessment. Enforcement of the State-established Uniform Building Code constrains development only to ensure public health and safety. Processing times for project proposals conform to State requirements. Although impact fees and requirements that force developers to make offsite improvements add to the cost of housing, these fees and requirements are necessary to maintain the quality of life within a community.   Fair Housing   The county contracts with the Fair Housing Council of San Bernardino County, Inc., which helps housing industry groups to implement the Voluntary Affirmative Marketing Agreement and to disseminate information on fair housing opportunities. The council also provides educational assistance on equal housing purchase opportunities. Furthermore, the county contracts with the Inland Mediation Board, which provides tenant-landlord counseling and education on fair housing laws.   Lead-Based Paint   In 1991 the State of California established a program that requires all children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years be tested for lead poisoning. Of the 165,285 children living in San Bernardino County, 25,737 were screened during a 2-year period beginning in 1992. Of these, 70 children had extremely high blood-lead levels, and 146 met Federal case definitions requiring public health follow-up.    Other Issues   Special needs households that require assistance to find affordable housing include the elderly, the disabled, and persons with HIV/AIDS. Housing affordability is a concern among elderly households and renters on fixed incomes, because housing costs often increase faster than incremental income adjustments.    An estimated 11 percent of the county population is disabled. Physically handicapped people often require dwellings that have specially designed access features.   The San Bernardino County Department of Public Health reported that the county has 1,420 cases of AIDS and 3,300 cases of HIV. These persons may need housing assistance sometime during the progression of their disease.   Community Development Needs   Each of the 17 cities and 9 unincorporated areas in the County Consortium identified community development needs, including public facilities, infrastructure, public service, and economic development. Overall, 12 communities identified a need for improved accessibility; 10 identified graffiti removal; and 1 identified rehabilitation for a reservoir damaged during an earthquake.   Coordination   The County Board of Supervisors appointed the Department of Economic Development (ECD) as the agency responsible for planning, coordinating, and implementing the housing and community development plan.         HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY   Housing and Community Development Objectives and Priorities   The county's strategic plan has four elements: an affordable housing plan, a homeless plan, a special housing needs plan, and a non-housing community development plan.   Housing Priorities   The main thrust of the County Consortium's strategy is to promote the expansion of housing opportunities for extremely low-income households. Low-income households are also assigned high priority.   To expand the supply of affordable housing, San Bernardino County will use two mechanisms. First, to provide affordable housing, the county will continue to support activities of non-profit housing developers and the County Housing Authority. Second, to stimulate production and to remove obstacles that inhibit the construction of affordable units, the county will continue to provide developers with incentives, including bond financing, density bonuses, priority processing, and fee waivers.   Over the next 5 years, the county hopes that at least 1,000 affordable rental units for low- income families will be built using mortgage revenue bonds designed to finance multifamily rental projects. The county also hopes that its bonding authority will fund at least 500 low- interest mortgages for low- and moderate-income families and will help 275 low-income families to buy a home through the HOME program.   San Bernardino County is applying for a one-time grant of $800,000 through the HOPE III single-family homeownership program. The county will use these funds to acquire and rehabilitate five dwellings, reselling the units to low-income families.   To reduce housing costs to extremely low- and low-income households, the county will provide these households with ongoing monthly rental assistance and security deposit assistance. The county will insulate and weatherize 10,000 units, using funds from State, Federal, and local sources and from the region's gas and electric utilities.   To preserve the existing stock and other affordable units for extremely low-, low-, and moderate-income households, San Bernardino County will rehabilitate approximately 200 multifamily and single-family rental units, rehabilitate 200 owned residences, and repair 1,500 senior owned residences.    The Housing Authority has adopted a 5-year plan that will encourage residents to participate in resident councils, training, active partnerships, and a homeownership program.   The County Homelessness Plan calls for development of a continuum of care that includes: providing the homeless with cold weather shelters and support services, offering prevention services to 85 families threatened with homelessness, and providing services and outreach at a domestic violence shelter. The county will support the Housing Authority's application for a $1 million formula grant from Section 8 rental assistance program. This grant will provide at least 30 homeless families and individuals with permanent housing.    Non-housing Community Development Priorities   Because of Southern California's recessionary economy, both tax revenues and charitable contributions to non-profit service providers have fallen. Consequently, the inventory of community development needs has grown dramatically.   Public facility needs include building and rehabilitating senior centers, child-care centers, and playgrounds. San Bernardino County also plans to acquire park land, to improve existing parks, and to finance seismic safety improvements.   Infrastructure activities include improving flood drainage, water systems, streets, and streetscapes.   As part of a long-range plan to develop a diverse network of needed services, the county will to help provide or augment public services, such as: senior citizen outreach; social, health, housing, and youth services; drug abuse prevention, recreation, and cultural-access programs; outreach and counseling; education, training, and referral services; and blight abatement.   Accessibility needs include removing barriers at public facilities in 10 communities and installing accessible park playground equipment in another community.   During the next 3 to 5 years, the county hopes to design historic preservation improvements for Barton House in Redlands and to complete preservation improvements for the Assistencia Mission in Redlands and the Twenty-Nine Palms School House.   To meet economic development needs, San Bernardino County hopes to provide business expansion loans that will leverage additional private financing and equity investment while creating or retaining 300 jobs. The county also expects to provide nearly $475,000 in Economic Development Initiative (EDI) funds that will be used as a debt service reserve and as capital for a small business financing program. To implement a countywide business financing program, the county will combine the EDI funds with Section 108 funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).   Over the next 3 years, the county will complete code enforcement inspections in Apple Valley, Barstow, Highland, Montclair, and Colton. The county will also demolish and remove abandoned or unsafe buildings in unincorporated areas of the Second and Third Supervisorial Districts.   Anti-poverty Strategy   The Community Services Department of San Bernardino County is the primary agency responsible for administering the county's anti-poverty programs. Its major responsibilities include providing job training, energy conservation and weatherization assistance, income management counseling, and rent subsidies.    Housing and Community Development Resources   To implement the strategic plan, the county will use CDBG and HOME funds as well as resources from other Federal programs, including: the HOPE programs, Shelter Plus Care, HUD Section 202 loans, and Family Self-Sufficiency Program.    Available State resources include funds from a State emergency shelter program and a program that finances rehabilitation of rental units for low- and moderate-income renters living in rural areas. The California Housing Finance Agency administers programs which are financed through mortgage revenue bonds issued by San Bernardino County.   The county also expects to receive the support of several quasi-public entities, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank. The county will also have access to loan pools maintained by the Savings Association Mortgage Company (SAMCO) and the California Community Reinvestment Corporation (CCRC).   Coordination of Strategic Plan   As lead agency for implementing the strategic plan, ECD will strengthen and expand the partnerships that it has developed with public and assisted housing providers, service agencies, non-profit organizations, and government entities. To retain and recruit commerce and industry, ECD will cooperate with economic development organizations within the county. To identify overlapping priority needs and to collaborate in developing mutual benefit proposals, ECD will coordinate with entitlement cities.         ONE-YEAR ACTION PLAN   Description of Key Projects   In 1995-1996 numerous key projects will be funded using more than $16 million in CDBG funds. These projects include major countywide activities, such as a $1.8 million Economic Development and Business Expansion Program, $2.3 million for housing development and preservation and smaller activities in individual cities and unincorporated areas throughout San Bernardino County.    Locations   Approximately 53 percent of the county's CDBG entitlement will be reserved for activities that benefit the entire County Consortium area. The cities of Redlands and Rialto, as joint CDBG applicants, will receive 60 percent of the entitlement allocated to them for city projects. The county will distribute the balance of its entitlement to participating cities and unincorporated areas, using population, extent of poverty, and extent of overcrowding as the determining factors.   Lead Agencies   Although city councils from each participating city identify priority needs and fund allocations for their jurisdictions, the Board of Supervisors makes all final decisions concerning priority needs and allocations.

The following topics and points summarize the issues and options on mayoral succession identified in this preliminary report for consideration by the Commission. Line of Succession  Issue: Who should be the first in the line o f succession? Options: Public Advocate, Comptroller, Council Speaker, Vice Mayor, Deputy Mayor.    Issue: Who should be the next person(s) in the line of succession? Options: There are many permutations of who should be the next person(s) in the line of succession.  Term of Acting Mayor  Issue: If the Commission proposes not to keep the portion of the current system relating to elections, whether or not it removes the Public Advocate's office from the line of succession, should the Acting Mayor serve f the or remainder of the unexpired term, or should a special election be held for someone to succeed the Acting Mayor? Options: The approach set forth in the General City Law is that the successor becomes the Mayor for the remainder of the term. In the current succession provision, a general election is held to choose someone to fill out the term. The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide for a special election. The current Charter approach was considered for mayoral vacancies by the 1999 Commission.  i   Special Elections  Issue: If a special election is provided for, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices (Comptroller, Public Advocate, Borough President, and Council member) provide for a nonpartisan special election. The alternative, of course, is to provide for partisan elections.  Timing of Special Elections  Issue: If a special election is provided for, what should the timing of that election be (i .e., 45, 60, 90, or 120 days after the vacancy)? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide generally for a special election after 45 days from the vacancy. Experience throughout the country varies. Considerations include the identity of the office of the interim successor and the amount of time the public would need to educate itself about the candidates.  Special Elections: Runoff Provision  Issue: If a special election is provided for, should a runoff election be he ld if the winner of that election does not get a high enough percentage of the vote? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices do not provide for a runoff, although one was proposed by the 1999 Commission.    Issue: If a runoff election is provided for, what should the trigger percentage be and how many candidates would qualify for the runoff? Options: The 1999 Commission proposed a trigger of 40 percent, with the top two candidates advancing to the runoff. Other choices (such as a trigger of 25 percent or three candidates advancing) are, of course, possible. These permutations must be analyzed in light of voting rights implications.  ii   Need for General Election  Issue: Does the person elected at a special election serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a general election be held following the special election? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide, in the usual case, for a general election to fill the remaind er of the term.  General Election  Issue: If such a general election is held, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide for a partisan general election. The Commission's deliberations on the issue of nonpartisan elections in general may be relevant to a determination on this question.  Special Considerations  Issue: What is the proper relationship between the choice of the person who will serve as the Acting Mayor and the choices about the election system? For example, if a Deputy Mayor would be Acting Mayor, should a special election be held more or less quickly than if it were, for example, the Public Advocate? Options: If the choice for which office the Acting Mayor comes from is considered by the Commission the correct one on the whole, but one that has some drawback, the Commission might propose to shorten the time until the special election, for example, in order to address the issue.  iii    Introduction Overview of the Charter Revision Process The New York City Charter is the basic document that defines the organization, power, functions and essential procedures and policies of City government. As a ""short form"" charter, it sets forth the institutions and processes of the City's political system and defines the authority and responsibilities of elected officials --the Mayor, Council, Comptroller, Borough Presidents, and Public Advocate --and City agencies in broad strokes, while leaving the details of operation to local law and agency rulemaking. Unlike the United States Constitution, which is amended rarely, the City's Charter is a fluid document that is amended often. Indeed, while the U.S. Constitution has been amended only 27 times in its 215 year history, the Char ter has been amended more than 100 times since 1989. In the United States, city governments receive their legal authority from the states in which they are located. In the State of New York, municipalities have broad authority to structure how they operate by virtue of the Home Rule provisions of the State Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law. The City's Charter, along with the State Constitution, the Municipal Home Rule Law and other State statutes, provides the legal framework within which it may conduct its affairs. Under State law, charter revision may occur as an ongoing process through the passage of local laws. There are limitations on that authority, however; for example, there can be no curtailment of powers of an elected official. A cha rter can also be revised pursuant to a State or City charter revision commission, which has the authority to put proposals before the voters. A charter revision commission may put proposals before the  1   voters regarding all elements of a charter, including the curtailment of powers of an elected official, as well as provisions that could also be adopted through local law. Municipal Home Rule Law (""MHRL"")  36(4) permits the Mayor to establish a ""charter commission"" in New York City. The composition of a ma yoral charter commission must consist of nine to fifteen members. The members must be City residents and may hold other public offices or employment. The Mayor designates the chair, vice-chair and secretary of the  commission pursuant to MHRL  36(4) and (6)(d). Charter commissions are not permanent commissions. MHRL  36(6)(e) limits the term of a charter commission. A commission expires on the day of the election at which a proposed new charter or amendments prepared by a commission are submitted to the voters. However, if a commission fails to submit a new charter or any amendments to the voters, the commission expires on the day of the second general election following the commission's creation. There are no prohibitions against the reappointment of a  commission or appointment of a new commission upon the expiration of an existing commission. A charter commission may propose a broad set of amendments that essentially ""overhauls"" the entire charter, or may narrowly focus upon certain areas and explain why such an approach is preferable in a report to the public. MHRL  36(5)(a); see Matter of Cruz v. Deierlein, 84 N.Y.2d 890, 892-893 (1994). The proposed amendments must be consistent with general State laws and can only effect changes that are othe rwise within the City's local legislative powers as set forth in the State Constitution and the MHRL. The proposed amendments must be filed with the City Clerk for action by the voters no later than the second general election after the commission's creation, and must be  2   voted on at a general or special election held at least sixty days after the filing. The proposed amendments may be submitted to voters as one question, or a series of questions or alternatives. MHRL  36(5)(b). The Commission's Membership In July 2002, Mayor Michael R.

They are as follows: Anthony Crowell, Co-Executive Director, has been a City attorney for five years. He served as General Counsel and staff counsel to the 2001 and 1999 Charter Revision Commissions. Prior to joining the City in 1997, he managed government affairs and policy at the International City/County Management Association in Washington, D.C. He teaches State and Local Government Law at Brooklyn Law Sc hool. Jan English, Co-Executive Director, has over 23 years of City service. She directed administration for the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. Currently, she  serves as Deputy Commissioner at the Department of Juvenile Justice; she has als o served in that capacity at the Departments of Probation and the Trade Waste Commission. Bradley Tusk, Co-Executive Director, recently rejoined City government after serving as a senior aide to Senator Charles E. Schumer. Prior to that he served as a senior aide to former Parks Commissioner Henry Stern. An attorney, he has served as an Adjunct Professor at Fordham University. Howard Friedman, General Counsel, has been a City attorney for 7 years, serving currently as Senior Counsel at the Law Department. He has served on the legal staffs of the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. He has extensive City legal  experience and has served in executive level capacities at the Loft Board. He has also been a Legal Aid attorney.  8   Other members of the staff are from the City's Law Department (which is a professional, independent law office that has represented, among others, the Mayor, the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, and the City Council), the Departments of Finance and Probation, the Business Integrity and Anti -Corruption Commission and the Mayor's Office. They include: Deputy General Counsel Elisabeth Palladino; Special Counsel Dara Jaffee; Assistant General Counsels Mark Tyler and Coleen Chin; Research Director Anne Fitzgibbon; Analyst Talya Sheinkman, and Administrative Aides Renee Wortham, Ivonne Sierra and Oscar Camacho. Most of these staff members served on the staffs of the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. How the Commission's Staff Developed Its Options Report on Mayoral Succession In preparing this report, the staff took its direction from Commission Chair Robert J. McGuire and the Commission members. The staff also looked to the reports and records of the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. Each of those Commissions  produced reports and heard testimony on the issue of mayoral succession. In addition, the Commission's staff solicited input from the public, conducted new research, contacted other cities to learn of their experiences, engaged the services of expert co nsultants, and consulted with various City officials, including other City lawyers and Charter experts, and election and campaign finance officials.  9   Mayoral Succession  Issue: Should the Charter's provisions governing the filling of mayoral vacancies be revised? Relevant Charter Provisions: Mayoral succession is governed by Charter  10. Other provisions that are relevant to a discussion of mayoral succession are Charter  8(f) (mayor's power to delegate functions, power, and duties), 24 (powers of the public advocate and succession), 25 (council member election and vacancies), 81 (borough president election and vacancies), and 94 (comptroller vacancies). Discussion: 1. Introduction The issue of ""mayoral succession"" really consists of two major issues: who should serve as the Acting Mayor when a vacancy first occurs, and how, if at all, elections should be scheduled to choose the person or persons who will complete the remainder of the term. In evaluating these issues, the Commission must weigh a number of policy  considerations. These considerations include:    Who should be the first in the line of succession? Who should be the next person(s) in the line of succession? If the Commission chooses not to keep the portion of the current system relati ng to elections, whether or not it removes the Public Advocate's office from the line of succession, should the Acting Mayor serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a special election be held for someone to succeed the Acting Mayor?  10         If a special election is provided for, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? If a special election is provided for, what should the timing of that election be (i.e., 45, 60, 90, or 120 days after the vacancy)? If a special election is provided for, should a runo ff election be held if the winner of that election does not get a high enough percentage of the vote? If a runoff election is provided for, what should the trigger percentage be and how many candidates would qualify for the runoff? Does the person elected at a special election serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a general election be held following the special election? If such a general election is held, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? What is the proper relationship between the choice of the person who will serve as the Acting Mayor and the choices about the election system? For example, if a Deputy Mayor would be Acting Mayor, should a special election be held more or less quickly than if it were, for example, the Public Advocate?     Elections to complete the term While the City has a consistent system for filling vacancies in almost every elected City office, the office of the Mayor is the exception. Voters are currently empowered to fill a vacancy in any other elected office by, in the usual circumstance, special election within 45 days of the vacancy. 1  The City now has over a decade of experience with these  special elections, which were established by the 1988 Charter Revision Commission. The Commission may wish to consider whether the filling of mayoral vacancies should occur in the same manner. Section 10(b) of the Charter currently provides that, upon a permanent vacancy (i.e., failure to qualify, resignation, removal, death, or permanent inability to discharge powers and duties), the powers and duties of the Mayor devolve upon the Public  1  Regarding succession to the office of the Public Advocate, see footnote 10.  11   Advocate, the Comptroller, or a person selected by the Council, in that order of succession, until a new Mayor is elected. If the vacancy occurs prior to September 20 in any year, it is filled at the general election of that year. If the vacancy occurs on or after September 20 in any year, it is filled at the general election held the following calendar year. 2  The result of this provision is that, if a vacancy were to occur on or after September  20 in any year of the Mayor's term (except the last), the interim successor (e.g., the Public Advocate) could potentially serve as Acting Mayor for more than 15 months before an elected Mayor takes office. This system contrasts sharply with the election system for filling vacancies in other elected offices, where voters are given the opportunity to elect a successor in short order. The office of the Mayor is obviously a crucial one. It is the seat of executive power in the City's governmental structure and is the focal point of policies affecting the lives of City residents. As the City's chief executive officer, the Mayor is most responsible for the effectiveness and integrity of City government and is the City's most politically accountable elected official. Providing for the prompt selection of a new Mayor by the voters in the event of a mayoral vacancy appears closely related to issues of democracy, stability, and effective government. Accordingly, while the current succession provision ha s been in place for many years, this Commission may wish to consider amending the Charter to allow voters a more prompt opportunity to vote for the person who will lead them. Furthermore, if the Commission does decide to consider a change to the election provisions for succession, it will need to consider options as to the timing of those elections. While vacancies in other City offices are filled, in the usual circumstance, by a special election within 45 days of the vacancy, the Commission may want to co nsider 2  The person elected at a general election would then serve until the end of the original mayoral term.  12   recommending that a mayoral special election occur within 75 or 90 days of a vacancy, in light of the high-profile nature of such an election, in order to provide more time for campaigning and voter education. 3  Who should serve as Acting Mayor pending an election? The Commission may want to consider whether the Public Advocate should remain first in line to be interim successor to the Mayor. There are benefits and drawbacks to having the Public Advocate be the first interim successor. The benefits are that the office of the Public Advocate is an elected office and has a Citywide constituency. The  drawbacks are that, in the event of a vacancy, particularly in times of crisis, the Public Advocate would often be someone who lacked sufficient executi ve knowledge of the City's operations to ensure stability in the City, simply because of the day-to -day ombudsperson role played by the Public Advocate. In such a circumstance, someone such as the  Comptroller or the First Deputy Mayor may be a more appropriate successor. Portions of the discussion below, including the sections on the history of the current mayoral succession provisions and on the options for which might be the most appropriate office to be first in line for succession, are relevant to the Commission's consideration of this issue.  3  A special election to select an interim Mayor within 90 days of the vacancy has been suggested by The New York Times (Editorial, July 9, 2002).  13   2. Background and History For over 25 years charter revision commissions have considered the issue of mayoral succession. The 1989 Charter Revision Commission's discussions on succession are particularly re levant to the issue of who the first successor should be, because that Commission had to address the issue within the larger context of the abolition of the Board of Estimate (""the Board"") and its replacement with the City government structure we have today. For most of this century, the Board was the most powerful and important governing body of the City. At the time of its abolition in 1989, the Board was comprised of eight members: the Mayor, the City Council President, and the Comptroller, each of who m had two votes, and the five Borough Presidents, each of whom had one vote. Membership on the Board was the most significant source of power for the office of the Council President. The Board exercised authority over some of the City's most important functions and responsibilities. It participated in the budget process, granted leases of City property, and maintained final authority over the use, development and improvement of City land, including through zoning regulations. It also had final approval of all capital projects and City contracts that were not awarded through competitive sealed bids. While the Council had the power to pass local laws and participate in the budget process, and the Mayor was responsible for implementing the City's programs, the Board possessed authority over important policy decisions that affected the City on a daily basis. In 1989, however, the United States Supreme Court, in Board of Estimate v. Morris, 489 U.S. 688 (1989), declared the Board's voting scheme unconstitutional, holding that it violated the principle of ""one person, one vote."" Because Borough Presidents held equal  14   amounts of power on the Board, the Court held that residents of some less populous boroughs, such as Staten Island, were over- represented, while residents of relatively more populous boroughs, such as Brooklyn, were under- represented. The Court ordered the City either to reorganize the Board or abolish it. Between March 22 and August 2, 1989, the 1989 Charter Revision Commission worked to comply wi th the Court's ruling. The 1989 Charter Revision Commission proposed to abolish the Board and create a new governance structure for the City that would receive the Board's powers. The  Commission wanted to continue the City's tradition of a strong mayoralty and, therefore, it transferred many of the Board's functions to the Mayor. The Commission also decided that the Council, as the legislative branch, should be the primary check on the mayoralty. The Commission expanded the Council's membership from 35 to 51 members, and granted it power to approve the budget and authority over land use decisions. The 1989 Commission continued the offices of the Comptroller and the Borough Presidents but with significantly different powers than they had enjoyed by virtue of their seats on the Board. The Comptroller retained certain executive - like functions including the duty to audit every City agency at least once every four years. Borough Presidents lost a significant amount of power with the end of the Board, but retained appointment powers with respect to community boards and were given some control over funding for their boroughs. The City Council President's role in government underwent a major transformation as a result of the 1989 Charter revision, which eliminated the Board of Estimate and, of course, the Council President's votes on the Board. Like the Mayor and Comptroller, the Council President enjoyed two votes on the Board and thus had the ability to exercise  15   significant influence over budgetary issues, land use decisions, approval of contracts, and zoning regulation changes. The duties of the Council President outside of the Board, however, were limited. As the Council's presiding officer, the Council President could cast a vote to break a tie but was not permitted to vote under any other circumstance. The Vice-Chair of the Council (predecessor to the position of the Speaker) was the person who effectively led the Council, not the Council President. Although the Council President had little input regarding the day- to-day workings of the legislative body, he was the immediate successor to the mayoralty. This arrangement was rational because the Council President had the same number of votes on the Board as the Mayor and was involved in the day-to -day executive decisions of the Board. With the elimination of the Board came a heated debate over whether to redefine the Council President's responsibilities or whether instead to eliminate that office altogether. It is widely understood that the 1989 Commission ultimately retained that office as part of a political compromise: certain Commissioners did not want then-Council President Andrew Stein to be ousted from City government. Indeed, Commission Chair Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr. has since acknowledged that the office was kept, in part, to keep the Commission's majority coalition from falling apart; he noted that this issue aroused ""puzzling passion."" 4  In the 1989 Commission's ""Summary of Final Proposals,"" the Council President is described as ""the city's `Public Advocate' . . . charged with receiving, investigating and attempting to resolve individual citizen complaints.""5 4  The Public Advocate has been  Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr. & Eric Lane, The Policy and Politics of Charter Making, 42 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 723, 818, 820 (1998). 5 Summary of Final Proposals, New York City Charter Revision Commission, August 1989, at 19.  16   described as the country's only elected ombudsman.  6  In 1993, the City Council passed  Local Law 19, officially changing the title of that office from ""President of the Council"" to ""Public Advocate."" In passing that law, the Council acknowledged that ""the most important duty of the President of the City Council is to serve as the public advocate for the citize ns of New York City."" 7  In short, it appears that while the succession provision empowering the Council President, now the Public Advocate, to succeed to the mayoralty has remained constant, the nature of the Public Advocate's office has been radically transformed, and now bears little resemblance to that of its predecessor under the Board of Estimate system. 3. Review by Previous Commissions  Both the 1999 and the 2001 Charter Revision Commissions reviewed the issue of mayoral succession. These Commissions analyzed different options for an appropriate interim successor in the event of a mayoral vacancy as well as the need to hold a special election following the vacancy. 1999 Charter Revision Commission The 1999 Commission reviewed whether the Charter's provisions for filling mayoral vacancies should be amended to provide for a special election or a different successor or both. In its report to the Commission, issued July 22, 1999, the staff analyzed these issues, considering factors such as the need for stability and continuity in the event of a vacancy, succession systems in major cities throughout New York State and the country, and the legal issues implicated by a change in the City's mayoral succession system.  6  Mark Green & Laurel Eisner, The Public Advocate for New York City: An Analysis of the Country's Only Elected Ombudsman, 42 N.Y. L. Sch. L. Rev. 1093, 1095 (1998). 7 Memorandum in Support, Local Law 19 of 1993.  17   One such legal issue was the question of whether a change to a system of special elections to fill mayoral vacancies would violate the federal Voting Rights Act. The  Commission retained Dr. Allan J. Lichtman, Chair of the History Department at American University and a noted voting rights expert, to provide a detailed analysis of this issue. Dr. Lichtman ultimately concluded that there was no evidence that special elections for Citywide offices would disadvantage minority voters or result in relatively larger reductions in minority voter tur nout. Based on this and other expert testimony, the 1999 Commission concluded that its proposal for filling mayoral vacancies with special elections would not violate the Voting Rights Act. 8  The Commission's ultimate proposal regarding special elections, contained in its September 1, 1999, final report, provided, in essence, that a nonpartisan special election would be held within 45 days after the occurrence of a vacancy, with a runoff election held if no candidate received at least 40 percent of the vote. A partisan general election would then be held to fill the remainder of the unexpired term. In addition to the special elections issue, the 1999 Commission also analyzed options regarding who could serve as the interim successor to the Mayor in the e vent of a vacancy. The offices of Public Advocate, Comptroller, Council Speaker, a (newly created) Vice Mayor, and Deputy Mayor were identified as possible successors. The Commission concluded, however, that it would not propose any change to the line of succession. The issue of mayoral succession received much public comment. A summary of the comments that were received by the Commission is attached as Appendix A.  8  The 2002 Commission has directed the staff to hire Dr. Lichtman to study this issue further in relation to this Commission's work.  18   2001 Charter Revision Commission The 2001 Charter Revision Commission also considered t he issue of mayoral succession. Ultimately, while the Commission stated that the City should adopt special elections to fill mayoral vacancies and should remove the Public Advocate from the line of succession, it concluded that such Charter reform should not be proposed to the voters ""on the eve of elections for every citywide office."" A summary of the public comment on succession issues received by the 2001 Commission is attached as Appendix B. 4. Succession in Other Major Cities  A comparison of the mayoral succession provisions for other cities in New York State and across the United States shows the wide variety of approaches cities have taken to address the issue of succession to the mayoralty. Other Cities in New York Under General City Law  2-a(1), where the mayor and the presiding officer of the local legislative body are elected at the same time, for the same term, by the electors of the entire city, the presiding officer becomes mayor for the remainder of the term in the event of a vacancy. As discussed below, New York City's existing mayoral succession provision, Charter  10(b), which differs significantly from Section 2 -a(1), is given effect as a grandfathered exception to that section. See General City Law  2-a(3)(b). Of the other cities in New York State described in this section, some are governed by Section 2-a(1), while others are not so governed, because the conditions set forth in that section are not met.  19   Albany.  A vacancy in the office of the Mayor is filled by the City Counc il President, who  serves as Mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term. Buffalo. The vacancy is filled by the City Council President for the remainder of the unexpired term. Rochester. The Council appoints a successor, who must be registered in the same party as the vacating Mayor. An interim Mayor is then elected for the remainder of the  unexpired term at the next general election for which there is time to file nominating petitions. If the Council fails to appoint a successor within 30 days of the vacancy, a special election must be held within 90 days of the vacancy to elect a successor to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term. As the President of the Council is selected from among the members of the Council, the succession rule set forth in General City Law  2 a(1) does not apply. Syracuse. The Council President succeeds to the mayoralty for the remainder of the unexpired term. Yonkers. A vacancy in the office of the Mayor is filled by the City Council designating a deputy mayor, commissioner, or department head as acting Mayor. A special election to fill the remainder of the term is then held 90 days after the vacancy or as soon thereafter as legally possible. If the vacancy occurs within 180 days of the regular mid-term If the  municipal election, the special election is held concurrently with that election.  vacancy occurs within 180 days of a regular mayoral election, no special election is held. As the Mayor has a four - year term and the City Council President has a two - year term, the succession rule set forth in General City Law  2 -a(1) does not apply.  20   Mayoral Succession in Other Selected United States Cities The succession provisions for major cities throughout the United States fall into three main categories: (a) cities where the mayor appoints the person who is the  successor; (b) cities where the City Council President becomes the Mayor; and (c) cities where the City Council chooses the successor. Details of the various succession systems vary by city. Such details include the qualifications of the interim successor, whether a special election is held to fill the remainder of the term, and the length of time before such an election is held. A number of major cities throughout the U.S. hold special elections in the event that a Mayor leaves office. These cities include: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati,  Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Portland, Oregon, Orlando, Phoenix, Providence, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Tampa, and Washington, D.C. Furthermore, many cities have endorsed the  designation of a mayoral appointee as the interim mayor. These cities include: Cleveland (Law Director), Denver (Deputy Mayor), and Cincinnati (Vice-Mayor; member of Council selected by Mayor), Houston (Mayor pro tem, member of Council nominated by the Mayor, confirmed by Council) and Kansas City (Mayor pro tem; member of Council appointed by Mayor). On the other hand, many cities take other approaches. 9  Charts summarizing various approaches taken by major U.S. cities are attached as Appendix C.  9  One factor that may affect the approach a city takes is whether the city's form of governme nt follows a ""strong mayor"" model, as New York does, or instead a ""council/city manager"" model. If the Commission so desires, the staff can analyze the U.S. cities listed in terms of this factor.  21   5. Related State and Federal Law Issues State Law While the options regarding changes to the mayoral succession system that the Commission might consider implicate provisions of State law, the Staff has concluded that the various options discussed so far are completely consistent with State law. For example, as discussed in prior years, one option the Commission might consider is proposing a change to the system of mayoral succession elections to provide for prompt nonpartisan special elections, as is provided for in the Charter for vacancies in all other City elective offices. See Charter  24 (public advocate), 25 (council members), 81 (borough presidents), and 94 (comptroller). This existing Charter procedure was  upheld in City of New York v. Board of Elections , Index No. 41450/91 (Sup. Ct. New York Co.), aff'd __ A.D.2d __ (1st Dep't), lv. den. , 77 N.Y.2d 938 (1991). The City's procedure was upheld, on municipal home rule grounds, against a claim that the Charter provisions were preempted by inconsistent provisions of the State Election Law. See State  Constitution, Article IX; Municipal Home Rule Law  10; Election Law  1-102; and Bareham v. City of Rochester , 246 N. Y. 140 (1927). 10  10  It should be noted that the special election provision intended to be triggered by a vacancy in the office of Public Advocate has never been precleared by the Department of Justice. While the provision must be precleared before it can be implemented, the 1988 Charter Revision Commission recommended that State law be changed prior to the City seeking preclearance. Specifically, that Commission was concerned that General City Law  2-a(2) might preempt the Charter's provisions regarding Public Advocate vacancies, because it mandates that the vice-chairman of the local legislative body, i.e., the Speaker of the Council, becomes the presiding officer of the Council, i.e., the Public Advocate, for the remainder of the unexpired term. However, to the extent that the Commission proposes to remove from the Public Advocate the now ceremonial role of presiding over the Council, see Charter  24(e), the concern of the 1988 Commission would become moot because the terms of GCL  2- a(2) would, on their face, no longer apply. See discussion of GCL  2-a(1) and 2 a(3). In that event, the provisions regarding who shall be the interim successor to the Public Advocate pending a special election, in the event of a vacancy, may need to be clarified.  22   To the extent that the Commission decides to propose any change to the terms of mayoral succession, whether as to the interim successor or the form of elections, General City Law  2-a(1) is implicated. Under this provision, where a city's mayor and the  presiding officer of the local legislative body are elected at the same time for the same term by the voters of the entire city, the presiding officer of the legislative body becomes the mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term. Currently, as the Public Advocate ""presides over"" the Council, Charter  24(e), and is elected at the same time as the Mayor, for the same term as the Mayor, by the voters of the entire City, the terms of Section 2-a(1) would seem to apply. However, the City's current mayoral succession provision, Charter  10(b), is ""grandfathered"" as an exception to Section 2-a(1) by General City Law  2a(3)(b). Because this exemption from application of the provisions of Section 2-a(1) arguably would not continue, however, after modification of any of the current mayoral succession provisions, it would arguably be necessary for the Commission to propose the elimination of the Public Advocate's ceremonial right to ""preside"" over the Council, so that the terms of Section 2-a(1) would not apply in the first place.11 Alternatively, the Commission might choose to propose amending the starting point of the Public Advocate's term, so that it would not run concurrently with the term of the Mayor. Again, this approach would mean that the terms of Section 2-a(1) would not apply in the first place. However, it should be noted that this approach might create additional complications regarding, for  11  Under Charter  24(e), a major power of the Public Advocate that relates Council is the ability to break a tie vote. However, under Municipal Home local law requires a majority affirmative vote of the total voting power of Charter  34 (passage of local law or resolution requires majority affirmative Thus, 26 affirmative votes are needed in the Council to pass any local law. tie vote is extremely unlikely.  to the power to preside over the Rule Law  20(1), passage of a the legislative body. See also vote of all the council members). In light of this fact, a meaningful  23   example, the application of term limits.  Under either approach, the Public Advocate's  aut hority to introduce legislation in the Council would not need to be changed. Federal Voting Rights Act A change in the rules governing mayoral succession could arguably be considered a change in a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting."" Such a change could require the City to seek preclearance from the Justice Department pursuant to the Voting Rights Act. Under the Voting Rights Act, a State or political subdivision may not impose a ""standard, practice, or procedure . . . which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . ."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(a). In establishing whether such an abridgement has occurred, one must determine whether, ""under the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected] class [i.e., race or color] in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(b). Whenever the City seeks, in general, to change a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting ,"" it seeks preclearance from the Justice Department as to whether the change will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. 42 U.S.C.  1973c. The change may not take effect until the City receives preclearance. Id. When preclearance is sought from the Justice Department, the change may take effect if ""the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to facilitate an expedited approval  24   within sixty days after such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively indicated that such objection will not be made."" Id. As to preclearance of a change such as one to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions, which would require approval by referendum, see Municipal Home Rule Law 23(d), Charter 38(3), the Department of Justice has set forth instructions regarding the timing of such preclearance. Under 28 C.F.R.  51.22, entitled, ""Premature submissions,"" The Attorney General will not cons ider on the merits: (a) any proposal for a change affecting voting submitted prior to final enactment or administrative decision or (b) any proposed change which has a direct bearing on another change affecting voting which has not received Section 5 preclearance. However, with respect to a change for which approval by referendum, a State or Federal court or a Federal agency is required, the Attorney General may make a determination concerning the change prior to such approval if the change is not subject to alteration in the final approving action and if all other action necessary for approval has been taken. It thus appears that the Justice Department could, but would not be required to, consider for preclearance any change to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions prior to approval by the voters at referendum. In 1999, the Charter Revision Commission's consultant, Dr. Allan J. Lichtman analyzed whether establishing a system of special elections to fill mayoral vacancies would have a detrimental impact on voting power or representation of the City's minority communities and thus violate the Voting Rights Act. He analyzed recent special elections in the City and other municipalities with high minority populations. Specifically, he  analyzed data for seven special elections for State Assembly and Senate, Congressional and Council positions between 1992 and 1998. Dr. Lichtman also reviewed special  elections in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Memphis. He found no evidence to support a  25   conclusion that New York City mayoral special elections would be likely to disadvantage minority voters by producing large reductions in minority turnout relative to the reductions in white turnout. Indeed, he inferred from the data that in a Citywide special election  minori ty turnout would likely be high relative to white turnout if a minority candidate or choice of minority candidates was competing for office. The Commission also consulted on this issue with Gerald Hebert , a legal expert on the Voting Rights Act, who worked at the Department of Justice for over 20 years and served as Acting Chief, Deputy Chief, and Special Litigation Counsel in the Voting Rights Section of the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department. After reviewing the opinions of Professor Lichtman and Mr. Hebert, the Commission concluded that filling a mayoral vacancy through a special election (using the procedure proposed by the 1999 Commission) would not violate the Voting Rights Act. Consequently, at this time, the staff has no reason to believe that preclearance would be denied for any proposal to change the line of succession or process for filling vacancies in the mayoralty. 6. Line of Mayoral Succession The Commission may wish to consider whether the Public Advocate should remain the interim successor to the Mayor. In addition to an analysis below of the office of Public Advocate as first in the line of succession, the following alternatives are also discussed: the Comptroller, the Speaker of the Council, a newly created Vice Mayor, and a Deputy Mayor.  26   Public Advocate The Public Advocate is currently the immediate successor to the mayoralty in the event of a vacancy. Charter  10(b). 12  The most significant power of the office is that of  an ombudsperson, i.e., an officer that monitors government operations and investigates complaints. See Charter  24. Though the Public Advocate maintains a seat on a limited number of boards, the office performs virtually no executive functions other than managing a small staff. As the prior discussion of the history of the office indicates, the powers and responsibilities of the Public Advocate are not of the magnitude of those exercised formerly by the Council President on the Board of Estimate. This analysis can lead to the conclusion, as it did for the 2001 Commission, that the Public Advocate is not appropriately the first in line to succeed to the mayoralty in the event of a vacancy. 13  It may be argued that, in a time of crisis, the person who  immediately becomes Acting Mayor should be someone who has an intimate knowledge of the daily workings of the executive function performed by the Mayor. Either a Deputy Mayor or arguably the Comptroller would meet this criterion. In fact, it may be argued that the Public Advocate, exercising an ombudsperson function, is particularly unsuited to be first in the line of succession to the City's most important executive office. The ""ombuds"" concept originated in Sweden in the early  1700s; by the 1800s, ""the Swedish Ombudsman had evolved into an administrative body appointed by the Parliament to protect individuals against the excesses of the  12  For a comprehensive description of the office of the Public Advocate, see Mark Green & Laurel Eisner, The Public Advocate for New York City: An Analysis of the Country's Only Elected Ombudsman, 42 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 1093 (1998). 13 See Making Our City's Progress Permanent: Report of the New York City Charter Revision Commission, at 112 (Sept. 5, 2001).  27   bureaucracy.""  14  Even today, the accepted definition of ombudsperson is ""a public official  appointed by the legislature to receive and investigate citizen complaints against administrative acts of government."" 15  While the office of the Public Advocate is elective  rather than appointive, its powers under the Charter remain largely within the classic ombudsperson model. Therefore, one could argue that the Public Advocate does not gain the experience necessary to immediately step into the mayoralty, particularly in a time of crisis. Furthermore, the Public Advocate's ombudsperson role may put the office  institutionally at odds with the mayoralty; in the event of succession, this fact may create a blurring of institutional separation of powers. On the other hand, it is significant that the office of the Public Advocate is an elected, Citywide office. One could argue that it is more democratic, even when  considering an office that may be filled for only a relatively short period of time (assuming that a special election will be held), to have the person who is first in the line of succession to be someone who has been elected to public office. Furthermore, considering that the Public Advocate has been chosen by the entire electorate of the City, it may be particularly appropriate for the Public Advocate to be the interim successor for another, elected Citywide office. An alternative between either keeping the Public Advocate as first in line of succession or simply replacing that office with another one could be made along the lines of Charter  10(a), the provision governing mayoral suspension, absence, or temporary inability to discharge powers. Under that section, the Publi c Advocate or the Comptroller, in that order, acts as mayor with certain limited powers until the suspension, absence, or 14 15  Green & Eisner, Public Advocate, at 1104. See the website of the United States Ombudsman Association, at www.usombudsman.org.  28   inability ceases. While so acting, the Public Advocate or Comptroller may not appoint or remove from office, and may not exercise any power lawfully delegated by the Mayor to a Deputy Mayor prior to the suspension or inability, or before or after the commencement of the absence. Furthermore, the Public Advocate or Comptroller may not, as a general  matter, sign, approve, or disapprove any local law or resolution until the suspension, absence, or temporary inability has continued for at least nine days. While the Deputy Mayor may be delegated many duties, he or she may not act on local laws or resolutions of the Council, act as a magistrate, or appoint or remove officials. Thus, while the Public Advocate or Comptroller may assume certain functions, the operational functions are retained by a deputy mayor. The advantages of such an approach for the vacancy situation is that would not necessarily involve removing the Public Advocate from the line of succession, and it would be familiar. 16  The disadvantage is that it might result in a tension between the Acting  Mayor and the Deputy Mayor, even if they were officially exercising different powers. Comptroller The Comptroller performs several significant functions and is responsible for the fiscal integrity of the City. The Charter vests the Comptroller with the power to audit all City agencies and all matters relating to the City's finances, and to settle and adjust all claims against the City. Furthermore, under Charter  8(c), the Comptroller participates in the issuance of City debt. Furthermore, the Comptroller is responsible for the registration of contracts for the procurement of goods, services and construction. Hence, the  Comptroller, unlike the Public Advocate, exercises certain functions that may be viewed as 16  If the Commission wanted to cons ider this bifurcated approach, it could consider either the Comptroller or the Public Advocate as the Acting Mayor.  29   ""executive"" in nature. Conversely, the responsibility to audit and monitor the executive branch may put the Comptroller institutionally at odds with the executive branch on various issues. This could create, at a minimum, an awkwardness in how the Comptroller, as Acting Mayor, would act in relation to the Comptroller's office. Furthermore, as the  Comptroller's responsibilities are largely post-action audits and approvals, and not service delivery or the implementation of legislative mandates, some might see the Comptroller's executive experience as limited. Speaker of the Council The Speaker of the City Council is the leader of the City Council, and is elected by its members. The Speaker does not possess an executive function and is not a Citywide elected official but, as the leader of the City's legislative body, is a powerful player in the affairs of the City. This role co uld give the Speaker the experience necessary to exercise the powers and duties of the Mayor until there is an election to fill the remainder of the unexpired mayoral term. On the other hand, the Charter, like the State and federal  constitutions, contains a framework based on a separation of powers, which could be compromised by allowing the Speaker to succeed to the mayoralty. The Charter's  separation of powers is manifested in a number of ways that would be compromised if the Speaker became the Acting Mayor. For example, the Mayor provides a check on the Council by approving or vetoing local laws passed by the Council. Conversely, the Council has an oversight role in relation to the activities of mayoral agencies. If the Speaker  succeeded to the mayo ralty, even on an interim basis, these checks could be lost. A possible variation on the idea of Speaker as first in the line of succession is to have a person chosen by the Council be the interim successor. This is currently the third  30   possibility for succession under Charter  10(b), which is the provision governing the order of succession in the event of a mayoral vacancy. Vice Mayor As discussed above, the 1989 Charter Revision Commission considered establishing an office of the Vice Mayor, who would be elected along with the Mayor. Creating the office would represent a significant alteration of the City's electoral structure, with possible legal consequences, and would require framing the specific powers and duties of that office. Deputy Mayor The Charter provides that the Mayor may appoint Deputy Mayors, as appropriate, with powers and duties as the Mayor determines. Of the various existing options for who should be the interim successor, a Deputy Mayor is most likely to subscribe to the views of the vacating Mayor and would be the person most likely to continue the Mayor's policies. In addition, a Deputy Mayor would be intimately familiar with the operation of City government and the role played by the executive branch, an asset that would be cri tical in a period of crisis and transition. A vacancy in the office of Mayor would inevitably create the possibility of significant volatility in the City. It would therefore be valuable to guarantee that someone with knowledge of the City's operations, such as a Deputy Mayor, become the Acting Mayor to ensure and facilitate stability in the City. Furthermore, if an act of war, natural disaster or other disaster in the City claimed the life of the Mayor, the need for stability and experienced leadership would be essential. The tragic events of September 11th have demonstrated the need for continuity in a time of grave crisis. As is widely known, Mayor Giuliani was able to develop a  31   comprehensive emergency response plan immediately after the attack. The execution of that plan was possible because the Mayor had extensive knowledge of the operation of City government and a close working relationship with the City officials responsible for executing the emergency response plan. It is arguable that, had there been a vacancy in the mayoralty related to the sudden attacks, a Deputy Mayor would have been best able to replicate the Mayor's knowledge and working relationships. Additionally, someone who is already in the chain of command to the Mayor, such as a Deputy Mayor, would likely be one of the only persons who could effectively command and deploy police, fire, and other resources necessary to respond in a time of crisis. On the other hand, it may be argued that the fact that a Deputy Mayor is not an ele cted official makes a Deputy Mayor inappropriate to become the interim mayoral successor. In addition to the general democracy concerns that would be raised, making a Deputy Mayor the interim successor could be perceived as giving him or her an unfair advantage in any election to fill out the remainder of the term, assuming that the Deputy Mayor were inclined to run in such an election. Therefore, if the Commission were to consider proposing that a Deputy Mayor be first in the line of succession, it might want to consider barring that person from running in such an election to fill the unexpired term. Furthermore, the concerns about the Deputy Mayor being Acting Mayor become more significant the longer the period of time for which he or she would serve as Acting Mayor. Therefore, if the Commission decides to consider proposing a change to Deputy Mayor in the line of succession, it needs to consider closely the amount of time before an election is held.  32   Summary of Charter Revision Options on Mayoral Succession As stated, the issue of ""mayoral succession"" really consists of two major issues: who should serve as the Acting Mayor when a vacancy first occurs, and how, if at all, elections should be scheduled to choose the person or persons who will complete the remainder of the term. Using the list of policy considerations listed in the Introduction as a guide, the following is a summary of the possible issues and options, many of which were discussed above. Line of Succession  Issue: Who should be the firs t in the line of succession? Options: Public Advocate, Comptroller, Council Speaker, Vice Mayor, Deputy Mayor.    Issue: Who should be the next person(s) in the line of succession? Options: There are many permutations of who should be the next person(s) in the line of succession.  Term of Acting Mayor  Issue: If the Commission proposes not to keep the portion of the current system relating to elections, whether or not it removes the Public Advocate's office from the line of succession, should the Acting Mayor serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a special election be held for someone to succeed the Acting Mayor? Options: The approach set forth in the General City Law is that the successor becomes the Mayor for the remainder of the term. In the current succession provision, a general election is held to choose someone to fill out the term. The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide for a special election. The current Charter approach was considered for mayoral vacancies by the 1999 Commission.  33   Special Elections: Partisan or Nonpartisan  Issue: If a special election is provided for, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices (Comptroller, Public Advocate, Borough President, and Council member) provide for a nonpartisan special election. The alternative, of course, is to provide for partisan elections.  Timing of Special Elections  Issue: If a special election is provided for, wha t should the timing of that election be (i.e., 45, 60, 90, or 120 days after the vacancy)? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide generally for a special election after 45 days from the vacancy. Experience throughout the country varies. Considerations include the identity of the office of the interim successor and the amount of time the public would need to educate itself about the candidates.  Special Elections: Runoff Provision  Issue: If a special election is provided for, should a runoff election be held if the winner of that election does not get a high enough percentage of the vote? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices do not provide for a runoff, although one was proposed by the 1999 Commission.    Issue: If a runoff election is provided for, what should the trigger percentage be and how many candidates would qualify for the runoff? Options: The 1999 Commission proposed a trigger of 40 percent, with the top two candidates advancing to the runoff. Other choices (such as a trigger of 25 percent or three candidates advancing) are, of course, possible. These permutations must be analyzed in light of voting rights implications.  34   Need for General Election  Issue: Does the person elected at a special election serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a general election be held following the special election? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide, in the usual case, for a general election to fill the remainder of the term.  General Election: Partisan or Nonpartisan  Issue: If such a general election is held, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide for a partisan general election. The Commission's deliberations on the issue of nonpartisan elections in general may be relevant to a determination on this question.  Special Considerations  Issue: What is the proper relationship between the choice of the person who will serve as the Acting Mayor and the choices about the election system? For example, if a Deputy Mayor would be Acting Mayor, should a special election be held more or less quickly than if it were, for example, the Public Advocate? Options: If the choice for which office the Acting Mayor comes from is considered by the Commission the correct one on the whole, but one that has some drawback, the Commission might propose to shorten the time until the special election, for example, in order to address the issue.  Upon direction of the Commission, the staff will draft Charter language reflecting its choices, or possible choices, on these issues.  35    APPENDIX A  SUMMARY OF COMMENTS RECEIVED BY 1999 CHARTER REVISION COMMISSION REGARDING MAYORAL SUCCESSION    Summary of Comments of Elected Officials Regarding Mayoral Succession  CITY ELECTED OFFICIALS Public Advocate Mark Green (August 5, 1999: Transcript p. 16) Believes that the special election proposal would repudiate the precedent of five Charter revision commissions retaining the current system of succession and would risk a disruptive series of campaigns and transitions. Opposes the special election provision and urges that the Commission withdraw its proposals. (August 26, 1999: Transcript p. 4) Opposes special election provision and believes it is wrong to change the rules midterm. Comptroller Alan Hevesi (Written Testimony Submitted August 12, 1999) Supports special elections. City Council Speaker Peter Vallone (August 5, 1999: Transcript p. 29) Believes that the mayoral line of succession should be clarified. The Speaker proposes that after the 2001 election, a Vice Mayor position be created. The Vice Mayor would serve as the Mayor's successor, be electe d in a general election with the Mayor and hold office for the same term.  A-1   Queens Borough President Claire Shulman (August 5, 1999: Transcript p. 8) Supports the idea of a Vice-Mayor. Supports special election proposal. Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari (August 9, 1999: Transcript p. 4) Supports the special election proposal because it gives the citizens of New York the power to vote on whom they want to succeed the mayor. Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer (August 26, 1999: Transcript p. 31) Proposes delaying special election proposal until the next election cycle. Council Member Noach Dear (August 9, 1999: Transcript p. 27) Supports the proposal that election be held within 60 days should the Mayor's office be vacated during his or her term. Council Member Stephen Dibrienza (August 5, 1999: Transcript p.66) Criticizes the fact that the special election proposal would go into effect immediately. Council Member June Eisland (August 10, 1999: Transcript p. 5) With respect to succession, nothing should be done until after the 2001 election. Council Member Stephen Fiala (August 9, 1999: Transcript p. 11) Supports proposal to hold a special election within 60 days of a mayoral vacancy, because it would bring mayoralty into line with all the other City elected offices. Supports the abolition the Office of Public Advocate. He would like to make the first deputy mayor or a vice- mayor next in the line of succession, then have a special election in 60 days.  A-2   Council Member Kenneth Fisher (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 48) Believes there would be too many elections and/or Mayors in one year under the proposed scenario. (One Mayor ends in December, another from January to February; an election in March then in November.) Council Member Katherine Freed (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 68) Criticizes the special election proposal because she believes that it would change the rules in the middle of the game. Council Member Martin Golden (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 23) When a vacancy occurs, the voters should determine person the best qualified to fill the vacant office. Therefore, he believes that the Charter should be revised to provide that a special election be held within 60 days to fill any vacancy that may occur in the office of the Mayor, Public Advocate, Comptroller, Borough President and members of the City Council. Council Member Stanley Michels (August 12, 1999: Transcript p. 20) Believes that special elections have historically produced low turnouts. The Mayor should not be elected with a low turnout. The Public Advocate is elected on a citywide basis. He has popular support and people are aware that he is the person next in line to become Mayor. Council Member James Oddo: (August 9, 1999: Transcript p.2 0) Supports the special election proposal. He also supports the abolition of the Office of the Public Advocate. Council Member Angel Rodriguez (August 11, 1999: Transcript p.114) Opposes changes to the succession rules.  A-3   Council Member Archie Spigner (August 5, 1999: Transcript p. 79) Succession should not be changed. Council Member Larry Warden (August 10, 1999: Transcript p. 31) States that the Public Advocate or the President of the City Council has been in the line of succession for 168 years. Council Member Priscilla Wooten (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 37)) Supports the special election in the event of a mayoral vacancy.  STATE ELECTED OFFICIALS Senator Vincent Gentile (August 9, 1999: Transcript p. 23) Opposes any changes proposed by this Charter Commission. Senator Carl Kruger (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 61) Recommends that the Office of the Public Advocate be enhanced. Senator Guy Velella (August 10, 1999: Transcript p. 50) Supports a special election to fill mayoral vacancy. Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz (August 10, 1999: Transcript p. 25) Believes that mayoral succession, if approved, should apply only in the next election cycle. Assembly Member Herman Farrell (August 12, 1999: Transcript p. 27) Any action taken by the Commission should be delayed until the 2001 election cycle.  A-4   Assembly Member Joan Millman (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 42) Opposes the special election proposal. Assembly Member John Ravitz (August 12, 1999: Transcript p. 7) Supports C ommission's decision not to change the line of mayoral succession. Supports the special election proposal. Assembly Member Scott Stringer (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 53) Believes sixty days after a mayoral vacancy occurs is not enough time for an election. Believes that the role of the Office of the Public Advocate should be strengthened.  FEDERAL ELECTED OFFICIALS  Congressman Vito Fosella (August 9, 1999: Transcript p. 34) (Testimony read into the record by Sherry Diamond) Supports the special election proposal.  A-5   Summary of Comments Regarding Mayoral Succession Received During August 6, 1999 Expert Panel  Lawrence Mandelker - Kantor, Wolf, Mandelker & Cass (Represented various elected officials during campaigns over the past 30 years, inc luding Mayors Edward Koch and Rudolph Giuliani; was a Law Chairman for the New York City Democratic Party and as of 1999 represented the New York State Republican Committee) He believes that the issue of mayoral succession should be deferred until the vote rs have determined whether they want vacancies to be filled for a period of 60 days to be followed by a special election. If vacancies could be filled in 60 days rather than as long as 15 months, having a citywide official become interim mayor would not be a concern. (Transcript p. 89). The Public Advocate incorrectly claimed that he was nominated and elected in 1997, because, among other things, the voters considered him to be the better person to succeed the mayor in the case of a vacancy. (Id.). He supports the idea of filling a vacancy in the office of the Mayor by special election. (Transcript pp. 89, 108).  A-6   Summary of Public Proposals Regarding Mayoral Succession Received by the 1999 Commission  The 1999 Commission received many public comments between June 30, 1999 and August 31, 1999. Many of the letters and e-mail received contained general issues for investigation by the Commission as well as substantive proposals for Charter revision. All public proposals were reviewed and considered by t he Commission. summarized as follows: They are   The line of mayoral succession should be changed, but not be effective immediately.  A Mayor who is unable to serve his or her full term should be succeeded by another elected official from the same politi cal party.   An office of Vice-Mayor should be created, and should succeed to the mayoralty.  The will of the people, as shown in an election, should be continued through to the end of the term. This could be implemented by having the First Deputy Mayor as first in line for mayoral succession.  A-7    APPENDIX B  SUMMARY OF COMMENTS RECEIVED BY 2001 CHARTER REVISION COMMISSION REGARDING MAYORAL SUCCESSION    Summary of Comments of Elected Officials Regarding Mayoral Succession  Council Member and Speaker Peter Vallone (By written submission dated August 15, 2001) Proposes that the position of ""Vice Mayor"" be created. States that with this proposal, the Vice Mayor would run in both the general and primary elections on a ticket with the Mayor and would be elected at the primary and general elections jointly with the Mayor by the casting by each elector of a single vote applicable to both offices. The persons having the highest number of votes cast jointly for them for Mayor and Vice-Mayor respectively would be elected. States that the Vice-Mayor would be the assistant chief executive office of the City with such duties and powers as delegated by the Mayor. The Vice Mayor would preside over meetings and would succeed to the Office of the Mayor in case of an emergency. The proposed local law would become effective for the November, 2005 election and every election thereafter.  B-1   Summary of Public Proposals Regarding Mayoral Succession Received by the 2001 Charter Revision Commission  The Commission received many public comments between from the time the Commission was appointed on June 15, 2001, to the time the Commission voted on the proposals on August 24, 2001. Indeed, the Commission received many letters  containing general issues for investigation by the Commission, in addition to substantive proposals for Charter revision. All public proposals were reviewed and considered by the Commission.     The Public Advocate's office should be removed from the line of succession. The Public Advocate's office should be eliminated. A position of Vice-Mayor should be created within the Charter. There is a need for continuity of executive policy when a vacancy arises that the Public Advocate cannot provide.

GX010-62-14878469	"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  Office of Community Planning and Development           Consolidated Plan Contact    CITIZEN'S SUMMARY   The City of Roseville, in southeastern Michigan, Macomb County, is located north of the City of Detroit.  The City is a suburban community which has developed primarily between the Gratiot Avenue and Groesbeck Avenue corridors within the County .  Action Plan   The City of Roseville will be receiving $560,000 for the Community Development Block Grant(CDBG) Entitlement Program during the federal fiscal year 1996.  In addition the City expects to earn an additional $100,000 in program income from previously funded projects.  The projects planned to be funded by these funds include: single family housing rehabilitation, public services, public facilities and improvements, planning and administration.  Citizen Participation   The Roseville City Council has delegated the oversight of the Community Development Block Grant Program to the Citizen Advisory Committee(CAC).  The CAC meets with City staff to prepare the CDBG budget, review the annual  Grantee Performance Report(GPR), grant waivers of the dollar limits to the rehab program, and to provide input and guidance to the overall CDBG program. Two public hearings were held in the process of developing the 1996 Action Plan.  They were held on March 5, and April 23, 1996.  At the suggestion of a resident the Neighborhood Watch System was added as a project in CDBG eligible areas.  No other input was received at the public hearings.    COMMUNITY PROFILE   The City of Roseville was incorporated on April 1, 1957 during the height of the  expansion years of the City of Detroit's suburbs.  However, the community began developing 150 years earlier, evidenced by scattered farmhouses still remaining throughout the city.  Suburbanization of the rural community began at the turn of the century due to the interurban streetcar line on Gratiot Avenue which extended north to Port Huron and south to the City of Detroit.  The City of Roseville's largest escalation in population occurred in the post war era of the  1950's through 1960's.  The City's current population, according to the 1990 US Census, is 51,412.  This is a decrease of 5% from the 1980 populations total.  This loss differs from the continued growth experience in Macomb County.  The County has continued to grow due to its expansive territory remaining open to development.  Although Roseville's population has slightly declined, the number of households in the city increased from 16,453 households in 1970 to 19,537 in 1990.  This  increase resulted from the trend of households becoming smaller, that is, fewer persons per household.  Thus smaller family size reduces the population but not the need for additional housing units.  The most significant change in Roseville's population has been the increase in  the number of elderly persons.  The number of persons over the age of 65 increased by 2,731 persons, for a total of 7,028 persons above the age of 65.  In 1980 the percentage of persons above age 65 was 7.9% of the total population.  In 1990 that percentage had risen to 13.7%.  The rise in the number of elderly has increased the median age in the city to 28.1 years, up from 23.2 years recorded in 1970.  Overall, 12.6 percent of all households in Roseville were headed by single women, an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous decade.  The racial composition, by percent of population, did not change during the 1980's.  One percent of the population was African American in 1990, unchanged from the 1 percent recorded in 1980.  The actual number of persons however, decreased by 108 persons from 621 in 1980 to 513 persons in 1990.    HOUSING AND COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT NEEDS   Conditions   As the City ages so does the population and housing stock.  As the growth of the outlying areas of Macomb County continues, it is assumed that families with sufficient income will continue to leave the older housing stock of inner ring suburbs in favor of new housing to the north.  In-migration of lower income elderly and female headed households poses new housing requirements for the City of Roseville.  The need for housing assistance programs continues to grow with this shift in population.  Housing Needs   Housing needs are determined by focusing on what is lacking in the housing inventory for certain household types.  ""Need"" implies desire for housing which may be beyond the income or housing quality limitations of certain households in the community.  Households and families in Roseville with the ""worst case"" needs are:    unassisted very low income renter households who pay more than half their income for rent;  persons living in seriously substandard housing;  those who have been involuntarily displaced from their current housing.    According to the 1990 Census, forty-four percent of all renter households in Roseville, have earnings less than $20,000, within  the  threshold for very low income households.  These households also experience the greatest extent of cost burden, with 61 percent paying more than 30 percent of household income on housing costs.  Households with earnings between $20,000 and $29,999, which would be considered ""low"" but not ""very low"" income, constitute another 31 percent of the total share of renter occupied households.   Eighty-three percent of very low income renter households in Roseville are cost- burdened, with 1,199 renter households paying more than 50% of their income for housing costs.     Seventy-five percent of Roseville's  occupied housing units are homeowners.  The number of low income owners is low due to the greater number of owners in the higher income categories.  However, the number of ""low"" income homeowner households ($20,000 - $29,999) is far greater than the same income group of renters.  Eighty-five percent of very low income owner households are cost burdened, with 1,537 owners paying more than 54% of their income for housing costs.  Housing Market Conditions   The 1990 Census reports a total of 20,025 units in Roseville's housing stock.  Ninety-five percent of all available useable land has been developed for urban uses.  Thus the extensive growth of housing without clearance is limited.   Home ownership in Roseville is substantial with 14,571 owner occupied units in 1990, or 74.6 percent of the total units.    Due to the construction of several large apartment complexes in the past decade, renter occupied units in the city have increased.  In 1990, 4,966 renter occupied units represented 25.4 percent of all occupied units.  This is an increase of 1,220 renter units over the 1980 total.    Affordable Housing Needs   The age of the housing stock in the City of Roseville contributes to a high amount of substandard housing in the City.  This will require continued efforts  to provide housing rehabilitation assistance programs.  Very low income homeowners and renters both have been shown to be cost burdened with respect to housing.  Both groups need rehabilitation assistance programs to maintain their units, as well as to increase the supply of affordable owner and renter housing.   The high percentage of elderly households in the City, and the fact that the elderly population continues to grow, indicates the need for increased affordable housing for the elderly, both in terms of rehabilitation assistance and in the maintenance of affordable rental senior housing.   Homeless Needs   At a press conference on May 2, 1996, the Macomb Coalition for Emergency Shelter(MCES) reported 3,939 homeless sheltered in Macomb County during 1994.  The two main shelters serving Roseville and Macomb County are Turning Point located in Mount Clemens, and MATTS located in Warren.  In 1994, Turning Point counted 13,212 beds occupied at night and MATTS counted 8,584 for the same period.  Eight percent of those that were served by these two shelters listed Roseville  as their last known place of residence.  MCES was appointed by the Macomb County Board of Commissioners in 1990 to study the needs and identify the barriers that exist and contribute to homelessness.  The results of the committee's study was published in 1991 titled, ""More Than a Bed for the Night.""  In the report, researchers concluded that the principal causes for homelessness in the County were lack of affordable housing, and extreme poverty.  Many root causes were further identified: the failure of appropriate job training to prepare low income persons for jobs in today's market; and the physical condition of housing which is affordable to the very lowest income population.  Other principal reasons for homelessness were: eviction due to lack of income, problems with relatives, substance abuse, elimination of State funding and General Assistance Programs, and a shift away from manufacturing employment in the Metro Detroit area.  The lack of transportation continues to be an important factor in promoting homelessness in the County.  Recently the voters in the County passed a millage initiative which creates funding for the Southeastern Michigan Area Transportation(SMART) bus system.  This system will give access the service job employment centers to those previously without transportation.  Public and Assisted Housing Needs   The City of Roseville Housing Commission administers 172 Section 8 certificates and 132 Section 8 vouchers.  Priorities for issuing these certificates include: housing assistance to the elderly and small families.  Female headed households have received approximately 75 percent of the City's Section 8 housing  vouchers and certificates and 60 percent of the rehabilitation program's assisted  projects.   The Roseville Housing Commission also managers 103 senior citizen public housing units at the Lawn Street apartments and 134 units at the Eastland Street apartments.  The Commission works with twenty-five apartment complexes, seven townhouse developments, and ninety-two private landlords and management companies to place residents in qualified housing in the Roseville area.  The waiting period on the Housing Commission's waiting lists for these certificates and vouchers is currently running about two years.   Barriers to Affordable Housing   No known relevant public policies exist which would impede or affect the production of affordable housing units in the City of Roseville.  Traditionally Zoning Ordinances are seen as a regulatory barrier when new uses of land, which would prove to be more affordable to very low income households, are restricted.  No recent instances of such restrictions are recorded in the City of  Roseville.  The zoning codes are used to promote compatible land uses within the City.  Fair Housing   Although little evidence of discriminatory actions exist in the City of Roseville which would prevent fair housing practices, the City continues to asses all barriers to fair housing and promotes programs which are targeted to assist persons with special needs, including those who federal preferences.  The City  fosters anti-discrimination practices, advocates housing alternatives for very low-income persons and encourages programs which assist first-time home buyers.  Lead-Based Paint   The City of Roseville Community Development Block Grant(CDBG) Program monitors lead based paint hazards under its housing rehabilitation project.  Educational information is provided to each homeowner with regard to lead based paint issues, safety of children, and reduction of exposure to pealing or chipping paint.  Other Issues   The needs of homeless, adult disabled, female headed households, and persons who are HIV infected are being considered through a network of care providers who have formed the Macomb Coalition for Emergency Shelter.  This organization was established for the purpose of examining trends, data collection, and reporting on work being done on a Macomb County basis.  Staff  from the Roseville CDBG program attends the meetings of the Coalition.  Through the Coalition the City has the resources to direct persons needing assistance for housing, substance abuse counseling, health care, job training, youth services, and other special needs.  Community Development Needs   The City of Roseville community development needs can be summarized as follows:    Housing rehabilitation and Home ownership assistance programs to provide affordable housing and improve housing opportunities for low and very low income households.   Public service programs to meet the social, economic, health, and quality life needs of low income persons, especially those who are homeless or threatened with homelessness.   Public improvement projects to improve low income neighborhoods and the facilities serving low income residents of these areas.    Coordination   The City of Roseville will work closely with neighboring jurisdictions and the county departments and agencies to provide an area wide solution to housing and community development issues.  City staff will continue to meet with other members of the Macomb Coalition for Emergency Shelter, and with service providers to work through a coordinated approach to solving the areas identified needs.    HOUSING AND COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY   Vision for Change   The strategy for change developed by the City of Roseville includes assessments of the City's housing and homeless needs, public facilities, infrastructure improvements, public services, accessibility, and planning needs.   Housing and Community Development Objectives and Priorities   The strategy for change has been developed in consultation with citizens and local organizations in order to coordinate resources and address the national goals of the Community Development Block Grant(CDBG) Program.  They are:    Preserve, improve and expand the stock or affordable housing in the City of Roseville    Ensure that affordable rental housing is available for very-low and low income elderly, handicapped and family households   Develop assistance programs for homeless individuals and families and those who are at risk of becoming homeless   Maintain and expand the supportive services of persons in need    Promote Fair Housing Opportunities for all persons    Facilitate public/private initiatives to improve the residential quality of Roseville neighborhoods   Identify and reduce barriers to the development of affordable housing.    Housing Priorities   The City of Roseville has set housing priorities to upgrade the existing housing stock through the residential housing rehabilitation program, to assist in the development of affordable housing alternatives for low income owners and renters, to increase the supply of housing for the elderly and those with special needs.   Non-Housing Community Development Priorities   The City through its participation with a network of service providers will continue to provide economic, health and social assistance to those in need within the community by targeting federal funds for this purpose.  Anti-Poverty Strategy   The City of Roseville will continue to utilize federal resources to operate programs which will enable low and very low income households to remain in their homes and to keep these homes in decent, safe, and sanitary condition, while enabling these households to us their limited resources for expenses such as food and clothing.  The City will network with other jurisdictions and area housing and social service providers to carry out anti-poverty strategies, including education, and self sufficiency programs.  Housing and Community Development Resources   The City of Roseville will utilize CDBG entitlement funding which it receives fro the U S Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD) to carry out its housing and community development program.  In addition the City also receives funds annually as income from its previously funded housing projects.   Coordination of Strategic Plan   The City will coordinate with other housing and service providers in the county in the planning and implementation of its housing and community development strategy.

A model of ""transit-based development,""  the Fruitvale Transit Village offers a unique approach to revitalizing  this predominantly Hispanic and increasingly Asian low-income community.     Since the factories and canneries that employed local residents began  moving out in the 1960's, the commercial strip along East 14th Street in  East Oakland has been in decline. A local clothing store that used to employ  21 people now employs four. In 1989 when BART announced it was going to  build a 500-car parking garage at its Fruitvale station, local residents,  who believed the garage would serve as a barrier to their neighborhood  and foster further economic and environmental decline, intervened.     Primarily through the work of Arabella Martinez, executive director  of the Spanish Speaking Unity Council, the concept of the Transit Village  was born. The concept is simple: link a local community's economy to mass  transit, thereby discouraging transportation by car, increasing pedestrian  and bicycle traffic and revitalizing the neighborhood.     Local community members participated in developing the Transit Village  plan, and their concerns have been incorporated into the design, providing  the critical aspect of community stewardship. ""This is not the usual planning  process,"" says Martinez, ""It came from the community and the people that  live here. That's new.""     The Transit Village will include a state-of-the-art child development/health  care facility, a senior center, a library, a community police station,  family and senior citizen housing and new and renovated retail office space.  These facilities will be connected through a Pedestrian Plaza to the Fruitvale  BART station.     The project is begin developed by a nonprofit community development  corporation whole purpose is to revitalize the neighborhood physically,  economically and socially while pursuing environmentally sound practices.               Program Highlights      Natural Resource Conservation         The project site -- currently a physically deteriorated and marginal business  sector containing parking lots and a four-lane arterial roadway -- will  be transformed to increase mass transit usage, to encourage bicycling and  walking, and to provide open space.        High density development will reduce regional waste production.        Toxic wastes on site will be cleaned up during development.       Economic Progress         Each component of the project will be financially self-sufficient.        Tenants in the new development, such as La Clinica de la Raza and the De  Colores child care center, have sufficient income to cover both the costs  of operation and debt service.        Retail stores under development will create 500 jobs.        Employment training conducted in the area will teach the skills that the  new businesses will demand, providing local community residents access  to the new jobs.        The new construction and job creation will generate income for many low-income  residents.        Increased sales revenue will help small businesses in the area.        Affordable housing will be more available to low- and moderate-income household  and senior citizens.         Human Development      Limited or non-English speaking residents will benefit from the health  and human service agencies that will be located in the area, providing  a multi-lingual and multi-cultural staff. Similar agencies in the city  do not provide this service.        The expanded La Clinica de la Raza will be able to increase the number  of patient/staff interactions by more than 50,000 per year, serving a total  of 8,000 to 20,000 individuals. Currently, La Clinica has a monthly waiting  list of more than 300 patients. Its dental clinic has a two-year waiting  list.        The community will be involved in the development, helping to generate  a sense of neighborhood stewardship.              Vital Statistics      Program  Management/Partnerships:  The Spanish Speaking Unity Council manages  the project and has entered into partnerships with La Clinica de la Raza,  merchants and residents of the area, the City of Oakland, Bay Area Rapid  Transit (BART), the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, A.C. Transit  and16 community groups including the Fruitvale Community Development Council  and the Fruitval Community Collaborative. Brady & Associates and Baker/Vilar  are developing and conducting community design programs.     Budget:   $25 to $50 million projected total project cost.     Community  Served:  The racially and culturally diverse population of Fruitvale  Community and the City of Oakland (combined population of 423,000).     Measures  of Success (Projected):              The project will strengthen the link between transit planning and community  planning, including land use policies and urban design.        The project will generate 500 - 1,000 community jobs.        The project will include housing for seniors, a multi-purpose senior center,  a child development center and a pedistrian plaza.        The project will generate 11,300 daily transit riders.        $15 million has already been raised with $8.8 million in funding pending.                                                 Back to Top                                                                  HOME     |  EERE  |  SEARCH"

Burns $138,073  Fast Facts  The proposed FY 2001 operating budget is $138,073,000, an increase of $2,541,000 over the FY 2000 budget. The agency net increase is largely due to implementation of Metrorail's late night closing on the weekends (at 2 a.m.) and enhanced bus service in the District.  During FY 2001, WMATA will launch new marketing initiatives to better inform residents regarding WMATA services and programs.    FY 2001 Proposed Budget by Control Center The basic unit of budgetary and financial control in the District's financial management system is a control center. The Washington Area Transit Authority is comprised of one control center that serves as the major component of the agency's budget.

A Board of Directors with representatives from each of the three jurisdictions governs the affairs of WMATA. WMATA's responsibilities include operation and administration of the system, the establishment of recommended fares, and the determination of funding from various sources, including the share of subsidy from each of the participating jurisdictions. The Office of Mass Transit (OMT) in the Department of Public Works (DPW) is the District's liaison office with WMATA. OMT continuously monitors and evaluates the provision of Metrobus, Metrorail and MetroAccess paratransit service in the District by WMATA. OMT also prepares the annual budgets, and processes the quarterly payments, for the District's subsidy to WMATA. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, created effective February 20, 1967, is an interstate compact agency and, by the terms of its enabling legislation, is an agency and instrumentality of the District of Columbia, State of Maryland, and Commonwealth of Virginia. This agency was created by the aforementioned states and the District of Columbia to plan, finance, construct and operate a comprehensive mass transit system for the Washington Metropolitan Area.

In the course of doing so, they have made preservation one of the most effective tools for revitalizing communities of all kinds and sizes.""   -- Richard Moe, President of the National Trust for Historic Preservation   Changing Places: Rebuilding Community in the Age of Sprawl (Henry Holt, 1997)      Back to top   Introduction   Go to the heart of any thriving community and you will discover the special place reserved there for historic resources and for the public transportation that enhances access to them. During the past two decades, Americans have rediscovered and embraced the historic elements of their cities and neighborhoods, and in recent years have shifted the focus of conservation efforts from individually important buildings and districts to the traditional forms, transportation choices, and street designs that make city centers and residential areas walkable and workable for businesses and residents. Cities and towns that have replenished and revitalized critical public transportation links in their downtowns and nearby neighborhoods are also extending their efforts to work with regional agencies and adjacent communities to capture the benefits of public transportation and preserve historic urban designs throughout metropolitan areas.   What factors have contributed to this urban revolution -- a revolution in the less-frequently used sense of the word, a ""return to center""? And how can we -- preservationists, local elected and appointed officials, transportation professionals, planners, and others interested in the health and well being of communities -- make the most of our existing historic resources to improve transportation options and livability in the widest possible range of places, from small towns to suburban centers to major cities?   The study that resulted in this book was initiated in September 2001 to examine how decisions about public transportation, land development and redevelopment, and historic preservation have complemented one another in dozens of communities nationwide. The goal of the study was to demonstrate how transit and historic preservation act as compatible forces to revitalize communities. We set out to illuminate the many ways in which communities of all sizes have restored their urban or suburban cores and made full use of those centers' capacities to help metropolitan areas grow sustainably. We wanted to find out how historic preservation values are informing community planning for public transit, and how these values are being used in development decisions intended to promote transit use.   In the early stages of our study, we focused on classic rail terminal facilities that had been transformed into intermodal centers to facilitate movement in and among modes of transportation. An important initial question was whether these splendidly restored monuments to the golden age of rail passenger service were serving again as vital hubs in multimodal transportation systems, and whether their revitalization was contributing to economic development activities nearby. We drew on the work of the Great American Station Foundation (GASF), which has documented economic revitalization near historic train stations. In collaboration with the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the GASF reported on its work in  Rail Stations: At the Heart of America's Communities , showcasing numerous examples of station restorations that benefited from strong local leadership in the service of reviving passenger rail and revitalizing communities through historic preservation.   We found abundant evidence that historic rail stations have an important role in community planning for public transit. Reuse of these stations can greatly boost the economic development needed to sustain transit and attract new riders. Our findings led us to extend the scope of our inquiry into other important aspects of the relationships among transit, historic preservation, and economic development. Much could be learned, for example, from exploring the influence of public transportation on historic growth and development patterns. We were curious about the large stock of historic commercial buildings that typically exist in downtowns, particularly those once served by rail: the factories, warehouses, and large-scale retail stores of previous centuries. We wanted to understand how these buildings served and were served by the local transit systems, and the impact of these historic resources on the character of contemporary central business districts.   We also took a cue from several major cities, including Denver, San Diego, and St. Louis, and examined the historic neighborhoods immediately adjacent to downtowns. In the vicinity of San Francisco, Cleveland, and Chicago, among many other major cities, are suburban villages that flourished historically because of access to the urban core provided by public transit in its golden age. We found that we needed to examine how downtowns and these nearby communities integrated contemporary transportation developments that accommodate automobiles, especially parking facilities, in ways that would support rather than undermine community preservation and transit-oriented development. We also needed to examine the ways in which downtown revitalization and historic preservation are and should be integrated into regional approaches to improving transit and local economic development.   Federal leadership in the past two decades has stimulated the kind of transit-oriented revitalization this report showcases. In particular, two Federal programs -- the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project and the Transportation Enhancements provision contained in Federal surface transportation law -- have provided communities with funding and other support to restore their historic rail stations and renew their downtowns.   NEW GOLDEN AGE FOR RAIL STATIONS   Northeast Corridor Improvement Project   Substantially completed by the mid-1980s, the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project was authorized in the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976. The project endowed Amtrak with the capability to operate fast, reliable, comfortable, and economically sound rail passenger service in the Northeast Corridor from Washington to Boston, while restoring landmark passenger stations in this corridor to their former glory.   Many of these architectural masterpieces, including Daniel Burnham's Washington Union Station and H.H. Richardson's New London Union Station, are on the National Register of Historic Places. These and other stations, including Boston South Station and Newark Pennsylvania Station, have since become important hubs in regional and metropolitan public transportation systems and are contributing to nearby economic development.   Much of Boston South Station's magnificent curving facade and a portion of the original main waiting room were saved from the wrecking ball after being placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The station is now the indispensable core of a multimodal transportation network that includes commuter rail, Amtrak, the Boston subway system, intercity bus service, and an underground bus rapid transit system -- the Transitway -- that provides public transit for the major redevelopment effort underway on the South Boston waterfront.   The Federal Transit Administration contributed $450 million to the cost of the two underground bus rapid transit stations adjacent to three key South Boston waterfront destinations: the World Trade Center, the new convention center, and the federal courthouse. The Transitway brings most of this 300-acre development within a quarter mile walk of modern, amenity-rich transit for workers, visitors, and residents.   This extension of center city Boston is among the most ambitious transit-oriented developments in the United States, thanks to dramatic limits on parking, a modernized legal framework for shoreline development, water transit facilities, pedestrian-friendly urban streets lined with retail and other active uses, and large, mixed-use developments balancing housing and office space.   The Northeast Corridor project's historic station restorations included elements that today are considered essential to good transit-oriented development. In addition to refurbishing the significant historic and architectural features of Baltimore Union Station, for example, the corridor project helped finance multimodal access to the station and developed a partnership with the city of Baltimore that produced additional site improvements, including new street lights, sidewalk repairs and reglazing of the station canopy. Commercial and retail space has been added or improved. Partnerships among units of government, transit agencies, and the private sector have enhanced the utility, community attachment, and multimodal dimension of these stations.   Image:  Boston South Station's facade during renovation.    Transportation Enhancements   Congress made the rehabilitation of historic transportation facilities eligible for transportation enhancements funding in 1991 when the program was first created, thus recognizing the value of rail stations and depots to ""enhance the community benefits of transportation investments.""   Transportation enhancements have contributed many millions of federal dollars and stimulated an additional 34 percent from state, local, and private sources for restoration of hundreds of historic rail passenger stations. The federal transportation enhancements provision has also provided funds for improved pedestrian access, landscaping, public art, and nearby streetscape improvements.   Many rail passenger stations whose restoration was supported with enhancement funds are presently functioning as important community and regional intermodal transportation centers. Few are grander or more ambitious, or more focused on the transportation mission than the Los Angeles Union Station Gateway Transit Center. Enhancements funding accounted for $19.6 million of the project's $125 million price tag. Art, architecture, and landscaping help create a comfortable walking environment within this giant multimodal transportation facility that serves regional commuter rail, Amtrak, subway, buses, cars, vanpools, taxis, and pedestrians. The individual's perception of the time and effort spent in walking to and waiting for transit is modified at the transit gateway in ways that are reminiscent of the impact of the historic station's grandeur on rail travelers. Transportation planners see the gateway experience as a means of restoring the notion that downtown Los Angeles is a place for walking.   The expansion of multimodal travel concentrated at the Gateway Transit Center is contributing to economic development in the downtown's north end, where Union Station's 51 acres are being gradually developed by the Catellus Development Corporation, the real estate arm of the Santa Fe Railroad. Both the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Metropolitan Water District purchased sections of the property for their headquarters. Parts of the old Union Station remain undeveloped, and Catellus continues to weigh development opportunities for its station area land. Another developer of office space about a block from the gateway cited proximity to great transit and a great building as one of the drivers for his project.    THE CITY BEYOND THE STATION   Historic rail stations in American communities are once again becoming dynamic gathering places for city transportation services and engines for economic growth. The rebirth of these historic stations is only part of the much larger story of how transit, urban revitalization, and historic preservation are working in concert to bring back our city and town centers. To tell that larger story, we decided to look beyond station redevelopments to the surrounding downtowns, nearby neighborhoods, and transit-oriented suburbs that are served by rail systems and that, in turn, contribute to the economic vibrancy of successful cities.   Much is being written about economic development and community revitalization. Information abounds on efforts to bring back cities, improve transit, and craft new development to encourage transit use. Recognition is growing that historic preservation is a key contributor to community revitalization. Little has been written, however, about how transit, development to support it, community revitalization, and historic preservation inseparably serve common goals and reinforce one another's successes. Our case examples weave these themes together and also address them individually. We have relied on the published work of transit and development professionals, community revitalization advocates, and the principal proponents of the historic preservation-community revitalization nexus, as well as the observations of practitioners in the field.   Working from these sources, we can demonstrate that public transit strengthens community revitalization, especially in urban cores; and that an economically and socially resurgent urban core is key to successful public transit. Historic preservation contributes directly to transit success by contributing directly to urban development. A closely related thesis suggests that restoring the centripetal power of a city's downtown is a sustainable way for a metropolitan area to grow more wisely. Historic structures and historic development patterns contribute to the success of public transit and, along with transit, contribute to the urban renaissance.   In addition to recycling old and historic buildings and returning them to productive economic use, cities are reclaiming environmentally degraded industrial sites for reuse as agents of urban revitalization and contributors to redevelopment. The physical relationship of these reclaimed brownfields to public transit adds to their value. The Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations, in a collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency, produced an informative and useful study of urban land reclamation in 2001 entitled  Redeveloping Brownfields with Federal Transportation Funds .   The more transit and adjacent development contribute to community revitalization, the greater the chance of success in achieving other goals, such as providing more travel choices, easing traffic congestion, lessening dependence on autos for virtually every trip, contributing to healthy air, providing affordable housing and the opportunity for wealth accumulation for working families, preserving open space and farm land, and improving the quality of life for Americans.    THE STUDY PROCESS   At the outset of the study, we organized a day-long symposium, attended by professionals in preservation, transportation, and development from both the public and private sectors. The group examined the characteristics of successful development adjacent to or in relation to public transit stations. Participants suggested places where historic resources were contributing to making the phenomenon work. A literature review was conducted after the symposium to discover written resources on the topic of historic preservation's role in transit-oriented revitalization.   Discussion at the symposium and subsequent readings suggested that successful redevelopment around transit stations could be measured by simultaneous contributions to many goals, including improved access and multiple travel choices for a mix of activities near transit, where the station and its surroundings make for a lively, attractive place where people can do much more than ride public transit. The fundamental measure of success remains an economic one: housing units are occupied, businesses are prospering, and more people are riding transit.   Vital Signs for Returning Cities   Early in the study the project team agreed that there were characteristics and vital signs of transit and transit-related development policies that set communities apart from one another and seem to be abundantly present in successful transit-oriented development. Separating these vital signs out for examination and comment does not suggest that these indicators exist in isolation of one another. To the contrary: The essential correlation among these elements in the real world of transit and transit-related development is our critical finding. Professionals and advocates working in transit, development, urban revitalization, and historic preservation have told us that to be successful they felt they ""had to do everything"" and ""it all depended on everything working,"" affirming the paramount importance of incorporating all of these characteristics into planning, design, and construction.      ABOUT WALKING   Walking is successful public transit's significant other, just as it was at the turn of the last century when railroad interurbans and streetcars were the mobility choices of busy and expanding communities . Vincent Scully once noted that the reintroduction of trolleys into the urban fabric would have to be built on a pedestrian base,"" ... on the willingness of people to walk a little bit -- and to live a good deal longer.""   The successful importation of the good walking streets of bygone downtowns and old neighborhoods into the transit villages of the 21st century reminds us that walking infrastructure still exists in the transit villages of the previous century. These were places with wide sidewalks and narrow streets lined with shops open to the sidewalk and displaying wares, where human contact was encouraged and welcomed. Merchants along these thoroughfares prospered because of foot traffic. Blocks were not long. The grid was complete and functioned as a travel connector.   The idea that people can be encouraged to walk much more than they do just by changing the look and feel of places is at the heart of the transit village concept . Transit-oriented development that does not facilitate and encourage walking is missing the opportunity to offer travel alternatives that people are going to embrace. Reviving the pedestrian experience in the vicinity of transit stops can strengthen transit's capacity to meet its goal of slowing the growth of vehicle miles traveled.   A study in 2000 by S.B. Friedman & Company of Chicago polled commuter rail passengers about their trips to and from stations. The study found that a rider's decision to walk is affected by a ""pleasant walking atmosphere,"" defined as an interconnected network of streets with sidewalks and a continuous architectural fabric, with stores next to the station. Large parking lots and even parks can act as barriers between stations and surrounding neighborhoods.      HARMONY BETWEEN LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNING   If the objectives of a transit system are to ease congestion, reduce auto-dependence, and improve air quality, then it stands to reason that development near transit should be as densely populated as the character of the place will permit, have mixed uses to encourage fewer automobile trips, and be as attractive as possible to potential patrons. Linked land use and transportation planning should also discourage exclusively auto-dependent land uses and excessive dispersal of commuter destinations that would work at cross purposes with transit investments.   Metropolitan planning organizations and regional councils of government are contributing to regionwide solutions. With their capacity to develop consensus and cooperation among local governments, regional agencies are uniquely equipped to promote supportive land use and zoning decisions on the part of local governments and to encourage better understanding of historic preservation values. For example, SANDAG, San Diego's regional planning agency, has unanimously adopted a regional transportation plan for 2030 that offers a blueprint for spending $42 billion on transit expansion, travel demand management measures, modest investments in freeway connections, and funding for small projects to strengthen links between transportation and land use.   Cities are also doing their part, implementing zoning and regulatory changes to encourage transit-supportive land use planning, promoting efforts to increase transit ridership, and supporting a regional commitment to public transit that supports continued economic growth.    COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT   Citizens and stakeholders must be a part of the many layers of public decisions that bolster community revitalization, transit, and transit-oriented development. Public support is necessary for success, and the public's sense of ownership will advance transit goals, facilitate agreement with difficult decisions such as zoning changes, and secure votes on critical public revenue decisions. Planning for redevelopment should elicit the participation of individual citizens as transit patrons and residents in compact, mixed-use, walkable neighborhoods; as well as citizens serving in community-based organizations who can provide solutions, help disseminate information, work to build consensus, and break down skepticism. To be successful, public involvement ought to be open, honest, early, and continuous, and its capacity to produce good transit and development solutions should be sought after.    Smart Communities: Curbing Sprawl at Its Core , published by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, describes how Bethel New Life, Inc. a church-affiliated community development corporation (CDC), helped organize opposition to the Chicago Transit Authority's planned closing of the Lake/Pulaski station and the rest of the Green Line in the early 1990s. The neighborhood of West Garfield Park had lost 60 percent of its population since the 1960s and saw the threatened loss of the station and Green Line service as an opportunity to reverse its fortunes.   Bethel New Life provided Chicago with an alternative to what the city considered the surrender of yet another city neighborhood to outward migration. As a result of citizen and CDC effort, and the foresight to organize support from other communities along the Green Line, West Garfield Park has a newly renovated transit station, the Green Line has been modernized, and plans are underway for a massive mobilization of private and public resources around a community revitalization vision that is at once intensely local and broadly regional.    GOVERNANCE THAT SUPPORTS TRANSIT INVESTMENT AND TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT   Federal, state, regional, and local political jurisdictions have become major players in the successful development of public transit systems whose increasing use is fostered by good transit-oriented design. This book contains a variety of examples of decisions by government agencies that contribute to transit success, including the judicious investment of public funds to promote transit use.   Governments make many decisions that affect transit's capacity to achieve its broad policy goals. The fundamental lesson is that transit agencies must continually identify government incentives and barriers wherever they exist. What units of government do and do not do are very often critical to transit success, most importantly as they influence a community's ability to foster transit-oriented development.   For example, New Jersey adjusted its building codes in 1998 for the rehabilitation of older buildings by eliminating certain high-cost requirements that were designed for new construction but discouraged restoration. In addition to removing much of the guesswork and need for variances from rehabilitation approvals, the new code made possible an incredible 40.6 percent increase in rehabilitation work in the state's sixteen largest cities during the first year of enactment. Applications for the federal historic preservation tax credit increased five-fold following the code's adoption.   In California, level-of-service standards in the vicinity of transit stations were adjusted to ease requirements for additional road capacity to accommodate anticipated increases in auto traffic near transit stations. Cities and counties can now exempt themselves from state-mandated levels-of-service requirements by promoting transit ridership with mixed-use developments.   Chicago is in the midst of a major revision of its zoning law, the largest overhaul of its kind in any U.S. city in 40 years, according to  Governing  magazine. A code that was hailed as a national model 50 years ago is no longer capable of guiding the growth and urban revitalization Chicago is experiencing. Across the country, codes have become an obstacle to reviving pedestrian life in downtowns and neighborhood shopping districts. Neighborhoods, including historic residential districts, want rules that require infill housing to respect the architecture and character of the neighborhood.   The list of government actions that can determine success or failure for transit-supportive development is virtually endless. It includes items that influence how downtowns and neighborhood commercial centers will be revitalized. Public policies that set rules for planning, transportation, zoning, the quality and location of public services and facilities, parking, the preservation of historic structures and neighborhoods, community funding priorities, and more can make or break a place's plans for alternate transportation modes and supportive development.    PUBLIC-PRIVATE COLLABORATION   Partnerships between governments and the private sector are evident in every case of successful community revitalization involving public transit. This collaboration is characterized variously by specific development projects, a local government or community revitalization strategy that promotes partnerships, and a myriad of practical arrangements that arise from unique community situations and opportunities, such as shared parking agreements. The older relationships between government and business, based on mistrust and an enforcement mentality that encouraged governments to micromanage private enterprise's involvement in communities, is giving way to mutually beneficial working relationships that create products neither government nor the private developer could produce alone. There are still rules, of course, and when they are applied consistently and fairly, developers can see active adherence to such rules as good business. The melding of public and private goods is seen as a progressive, pragmatic solution to the practical difficulty of getting things done.      ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING   Transit shaped the development of older and historic urban neighborhoods and first-ring suburbs, and then disappeared. Metropolitan areas promoting returning transit systems can ill afford to ignore the potential for patrons living in these neighborhoods of character and quality.   Much of America's existing supply of affordable housing is found in older and historic neighborhoods, according to an analysis by noted land use and real estate expert Donovan Rypkema that appeared in the Spring 2003 issue of the National Trust's Forum Journal. These neighborhoods are home to 31 percent of homeowners with household income below $20,000, and to 31 percent of African American, 24 percent of Hispanic, and 29 percent of elderly homeowners. Over half of all owner-occupied housing units in older and historic neighborhoods have monthly housing costs of less than $500.   Much of the existing housing stock in older and historic neighborhoods is being destroyed. This is a national tragedy, especially when public resources are being pumped into building replicas in new communities of what is being torn down in the older and historic neighborhoods. In the closing three decades of the 20th century, 6.3 million units of year-round housing in older and historic neighborhoods were destroyed.   Housing experts estimate a need for 18 million additional housing units in the first decade of the 21st century .Three million of them can be found today -- vacant and decaying -- in the country's older and historic neighborhoods .Their restoration and reuse, as part of a community's comprehensive reestablishment of transit-oriented development, should be a top priority. Affordable housing and home ownership opportunities near public transit for moderate-income working families in mixed-use, mixed-income settings may well be the easiest of all the Smart Growth goals to achieve, and the one with the most benefits, especially for the wealth-building aspirations of working families overwhelmed today by both housing costs and transportation costs occasioned by auto dependence.   Donovan Rypkema has observed that the first step policy makers can take is to ban the prevailing attitude that ""We have to destroy this neighborhood in order to save it,"" and the second is to accept the validity of the notion that it is very hard to build new and rent or sell inexpensively.   The success stories in downtown revitalization are in the cities and towns that maintained and reinvested in their historic buildings and recognized their character, quality, and ultimate desirability. In these places, historic preservation and restoration of public transit worked hand in hand to generate urban revitalization .The next logical step is to transfer the lessons and successes to the older and historic adjacent neighborhoods and the first-ring suburbs, where transit-oriented development first demonstrated its many benefits during the 20th century.      The partnership approach extends well beyond the critical pooling of resources by private developers and the public sector -- transit agencies and local government. Early involvement of citizens who know their neighborhoods and have earned the right to represent their views and interests -- such as Main Street groups, citizens associations, and community development corporations -- are helpful additions to the leadership of locally elected officials.    FLEXIBLE FINANCING   Like public-private collaboration, financing arrangement issues for transit-oriented developments often involve multiple sources of funds both public and private. Creative financing is a function of the strength of the public-private partnership and is frequently dependent upon the active participation of units of government.   Particularly where the revitalization of existing neighborhoods has residential, commercial, and public improvement components, as most do, and where revitalization is transit-oriented development on a neighborhood scale, the challenges to needed financing can be large and complex. The interdependence of vital signs involving the assembly of financing sources, community involvement, governmental commitments, planning, and public-private partnerships is especially evident, as is the potential for great gains for the many goals of public transit.   The mix of financing instruments -- mortgages, subordinated debt, grants, tax abatements and credits, and patient equity investments -- can be unique and rely on more partners bringing more financing sources than in the usual development project. More partners with more resources and more insights complicate and strengthen the financing of transit-oriented development, as does the involvement of a large number of rehabilitations of existing, privately owned buildings.   The potential of the federal New Markets Tax Credits, designed to stimulate business development in low and moderate income communities, is worth exploring. The 37 percent tax credit, offered over seven years for individuals and companies who invest in commercial projects, is expected to generate $15 billion in new capital by 2012.   Although New Markets gives no special preference to small and neighborhood businesses in commercial districts of older and historic areas, the program's emphasis on low- and moderate-income communities appears tailor-made for the commercial blocks of older, urban, and first-ring neighborhoods. Housing rental units would be eligible for New Markets as long as they are part of a mixed-use development and generate less than 80 percent of the building's overall revenue.   Kennedy Smith, director of the National Main Street Center, itself heavily involved in promoting the potential of New Markets to generate capital for neighborhood-serving business districts, says: ""Every dollar of New Markets Tax Credits awarded to investors supporting main street business development not only strengthens our historic commercial districts; it also prevents a dollar of the tax credits from being used to support suburban-style business development or to demolish historic main street buildings.""    PRAGMATIC, FORWARD-LOOKING APPROACHES TO PARKING   Parking needs can quickly become the tail wagging the dog when community revitalization strategies are on the table. Meeting a community's immediate parking needs while working to curb and even reduce those needs over time calls for sensitivity to other vital signs such as community awareness and involvement, governance, and economic factors. Transit systems have stages of development and maturity and are at specific stages of maturity in different parts of their own systems. Park-and-ride operations have a role to play in newer transit systems or at outlying stations, as do parking concessions for residents and commercial operations that address both transit use and residual auto dependence. Bolder parking policies are called for in places where the transit system is fully developed and quite capable of succeeding while discouraging driving.   Parking issues must be addressed pragmatically. Citizen reaction to density produced by commercial and residential developments is almost always about auto congestion and parking availability. Policy makers need to be sympathetic and skilled in navigating citizen concerns, and at the same time should advocate for parking schemes that rely on -- rather than conflict with -- the availability of transit and other services within a pleasant walking environment.   No aspect of transit-supportive development is more parochial than parking and less susceptible to generalized solutions, but it is important to understand that communities such as Gaithersburg, Maryland; Denver, Colorado; and South Orange, New Jersey are moving ahead to devise parking strategies based on the availability of transit within a good walking environment for many daily needs that reduces auto dependence and therefore demand for suburban-style parking arrangements.   Communities are focusing on the true costs of parking and how it adversely affects the costs of affordable housing. Excessive parking reduces the opportunity for transit and transit-oriented development to meet goals for reducing auto dependence. Transportation demand management; incentives for transit use, including employer-provided transit passes; an equalization of federal tax benefits provided for parking and transit; and the full range of trip-reduction capacities inherent in transit access and transit supportive development all can help communities committed to travel choices to break away from suburban-style parking approaches, when conditions warrant.    Measures of Success   The many partners in a successful transit-oriented revitalization need to measure their success separately as they remain mindful of the mutual benefits of their joint efforts. Transit agencies must demonstrate increased ridership. Metropolitan and air quality officials need to show a decline in the growth of vehicle miles traveled. Local governments and citizen groups often want clear signs that affordable housing has been preserved and real estate values maintained or increased. Mayors want to see rising sales tax revenue. Downtown civic groups and cities want to see the growth of jobs and activities downtown. Residents of older neighborhoods want to maintain or enhance home ownership and the quality of life they have come to expect where they live.   Less obvious but no less important are the qualitative measures of a successful revitalization involving historic preservation and transit. Among the many possibilities, we noted the following:   • Avid and continued interest among a variety of private and public entities in development opportunities for parcels large and small within the revitalization area; especially during an economic downturn;  • Sufficient maturity of a redevelopment area or a history of development cycles in an area that indicates long-term success;  • Presence of transportation choices that work together to increase transit use and promote community reinvestment;  • Intact historic resources with promising redevelopment and adaptive reuse opportunities, as well as patterns of settlement and travel that support and increase transit use and attract historic preservation;  • Financial success on the part of both the transit systems and the developers of property served by those systems; and  • Enthusiastic community acceptance of the blending of transit and redevelopment of historic places.    WHEN IS TOD REALLY TOD?   The study team understood that our use of the term transit-oriented development (TOD) would raise certain expectations and perhaps impose limitations on the study. TOD is a much-hyped concept, and with the hype has come a predictable amount of misinformation and misrepresentation within the policy and development worlds. Even the most knowledgeable proponents of TOD also tend to emphasize the development aspect of the concept. With some notable exceptions, including Michael Bernick's and Robert Cervero's  Transit Villages in the 21st Century , much of the existing literature on TOD is about new places created along transit corridors, with infrequent mention of the fact that many of the core concepts of TOD are derived from practices that were commonplace in years gone by.   The highly visible ""neo-traditional"" success stories have led to a notion of TOD as a new idea. In fact, new TOD developments promote transit use through time-honored strategies to create density and mixed uses, income diversity, and pedestrian-supportive design. Such characteristics are already present -- though often in need of rehabilitation and support -- in the older communities that thrived before the full flowering of our present highway-intensive way of life. Yet the resurgence of the many intact older communities that inspired the New Urbanism is less well known. We set out to shed light on this glaring gap in the story of America's great places.   Development that is merely adjacent to transit and lacks the characteristics necessary to support transit is unlikely to function very effectively as a generator of transit use. The transit villages that came of age in the late 19th century exhibited all the characteristics modern TOD proponents describe as ideal for today, including a coherent transportation pattern that worked within each transit village at the pedestrian scale and multiplied efficiently throughout corridors and regions, connecting neighborhoods and suburban towns to the urban core via public transportation. Transit shaped the development of many of these places and then disappeared. Some are being revitalized, with or without a strong transit component. Others are ripe to be recycled and reintegrated into the larger, once-vibrant, transit-connected metropolis of old. And still others just wait -- great wastes of urban resources whose return could contribute again to planned and well-managed metropolitan growth.   Today's transit-oriented development must take its cue from these historically efficient places, using them as backbones for redevelopment and compatible infill development. Our planning for transit-oriented developments must extend beyond station area development and into the metropolitan arena. The most successful TOD projects acknowledge and enhance a downtown's or neighborhood's contribution to public transit service regionwide. Just as a transit system that provides travel options is absolutely essential to metropolitan revitalization, a dynamic historic preservation component that offers many development opportunities is a most deliberate element in revitalization of the core, nearby neighborhoods, and outlying town centers still connected to the core.    THE RESURGENT CITY   Most cities have an active historic preservation component to their revitalization activities, of which public transit is also an integral part. As Donovan Rypkema has said, ""I have a hard time separating downtown revitalization and historic preservation, for one simple reason: I cannot identify a single sustained success story in downtown revitalization in a city of any size anywhere in the country where historic preservation was not a key element in the process.""   In selecting our case examples, we sought a cross-section of approaches to the challenge of inviting growth and preserving historic resources in and near downtowns, with a strong transit component. We focused slightly more attention on four cities and regions (coincidentally, all of them in Western states): Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas; Denver, Colorado; San Diego, California; and the San Francisco Bay Area. These regions each embody different aspects of the challenges and opportunities facing all thirteen of our study areas. In Denver, and San Diego, for example, adaptive reuse of individual buildings or clusters of buildings in the central business district is a practice of long standing that has led to more ambitious regional approaches to revitalization. Yet the connections among historic preservation, land use planning, and transit are more explicit in Denver than in San Diego, even though the opportunities are similar. In Dallas and Fort Worth, the private sector is discovering the benefits of anchoring residential and commercial development in historic areas that are newly served by state-of-the-art transit systems. In the Bay Area, the regional transit authority is working with several communities to correct flaws in the original siting of facilities and to recreate public space and Main Street-style thoroughfares in suburban centers.   Our smaller case studies highlight more discrete examples of successful transit-oriented development that incorporates historic preservation. For example, St. Louis and Cleveland have invested in rehabilitating historic transit lines or hubs at the same time that they invested in the historic centers and neighborhoods served by those facilities. Other communities -- such as Arlington, Virginia -- took advantage of proposed new transit facilities to restore and strengthen transit-oriented development where its legacy already existed. Major cities such as Washington, D.C. and Chicago, Illinois, planned station area redevelopment around historic resources along transit rail routes. Thus preservation becomes not only an activity to rescue existing historic resources in the urban core but also to restore the traditional forms that serve walking and transit in newer, more recently settled suburban centers and neighborhoods.   Even in auto-dependent regions of the country, such as the Sunbelt, governments and private developers are recognizing the wisdom of traditional development and historic resources as centerpieces for revitalization and transit investment. The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), with jurisdiction over a 16-county area that includes Dallas, Fort Worth, and Denton, believes that the historic transit-supportive form of major downtowns can and should be replicated throughout the region. The historic farming community of Plano, which has grown practically overnight into an affluent, burgeoning city in its own right, is currently testing NCTCOG's assumptions with neotraditional planning, mixed-use development, and preservation of its small historic downtown as an integral part of its light rail transit investment.   The communities profiled in this book all show a conscious, citywide or regional commitment to build on preservation and adaptive reuse of historic resources as vital signs. Transit officials, city and regional planners, and private developers in these communities are aware that to be successful they had to ""do it all:"" promote preservation while encouraging redevelopment, encourage community input and acceptance while making sure the process didn't bog down or show insufficient progress, expand and diversify travel choices without putting the transportation cart before the land use horse; ascertain financial viability for transit and development projects while maintaining adequate public involvement and making decisions for the public good. The complex trade-offs and sophisticated partnerships that TOD calls for cannot take place without a concerted, ongoing commitment to an overall vision and redevelopment program.   Cities and downtown organizations are reaching beyond the immediate central business district to capture and enhance the revitalization benefits of nearby older neighborhoods. These neighborhoods often act as ""whole-cloth"" transit-oriented developments, demonstrating that transit-supportive density and residential desirability are not mutually exclusive, that good walking streets and easy access to transit are neighborhood characteristics as sought-after by homebuyers as good schools and other amenities; and that the irreplaceable historic character of these close-in neighborhoods, combined with their capacity to provide housing and homes for working families, makes them indispensable elements of any strategy to boost jobs and services downtown.   Cultural and historic resources make an essential contribution to urban and community revitalization, and to transit wherever it is part of the revitalization effort. The future of a downtown rests to a great degree on a willingness to invest in its past. In many cities across America, a commitment to a revitalized future rooted in historic preservation is being pursued side by side with the revitalization of public transit. They support one another, and together they support a strengthened core as the foundation of a successful regional transit system.    ""The bottom line: Today's transit-oriented planners increasingly acknowledge the wisdom of history, that what worked for the train spotters of yesterday holds the best promise of working for future rail riders.   And in linking transit to users, these planners are connecting to the American past of sensible town planning -- and putting increasing weight on the oldest of transportation vehicles: the human foot."" CHRISTINE KREYLING,  WRITING IN  PLANNING  JANUARY, 2001      Back to top   Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas   Sprawling Sunbelt Cities Adopt TOD   TRAVEL CHOICE COMES TO NORTH TEXAS   The Metroplex is typical of many Southwestern regions: big and rapidly growing bigger; with a strong, diverse economy; and dependent on an auto-oriented transportation system that feeds the spread of development ever outward. In recent years, the Metroplex has committed itself to regional public transit and travel choice, as necessary for continued economic prosperity. The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), a voluntary association of local governments that is the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the Metroplex, has devised its long-term transportation plan to guide the expenditure of federal, state, and local funds for transportation improvements in ways that will encourage more economical land use and sustainable development.   Mobility 2025: The Metropolitan Development Plan , developed by NCTCOG's Regional Transportation Council, defines four sustainable development categories: strategic urban development, integrated land-use planning/urban design, transit-oriented development, and access management. The plan includes financial support for local initiatives to revitalize town centers, create mixed-use growth centers, and promote transit- and pedestrian-oriented developments as well as infill and brownfield reclamation. The plan will help local government complement rail investments with coordinated investments in park-and-ride, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities, and other means of promoting access to public transit.   The Metroplex faces challenges to maintaining these efforts. Although downtown revitalization has taken hold in both major cities, developers often still prefer to build out where land is plentiful and inexpensive. Many residents of the Metroplex still seem willing to withstand air quality problems, traffic congestion, and long commutes in order to indulge a strong preference for driving alone.   Both Dallas and Fort Worth have stunning historic architecture in their downtowns and nearby cultural districts, including National Historic Landmarks and National Register-listed resources, from the Fort Worth Stockyards and commercial area to Dallas's 277-acre Fair Park Cultural District, where Art Deco museum and exhibit buildings constructed for the 1936 Texas Centennial Exposition have been reused for contemporary art and science museums.    The older neighborhoods of Dallas and Fort Worth are eclectic treasure troves of vernacular residential architecture, including late Victorian gingerbread houses and Prairie-style houses with generous front porches, and numerous duplex townhouses from the 1920s through the 1950s that increase population density without affecting the quiet residential character of tree-lined streets near downtown.   Since the early 1980s, a small but muscular cadre of private entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and city residents in both Dallas and Fort Worth have established a welcoming culture for historic preservation and adaptive reuse in and near downtown, demonstrating to the cities and the public at large the economic and community benefits of preserving the unique character and sense of place of neighborhoods and commercial centers. The region's plans for growth include revitalization of Dallas and Fort Worth, cities where the historic structures are concentrated, where historic preservation has value, and where the impulse for transportation choice is strongest. Multiple goals are being pursued side by side, and the unfolding of it all is worth a good look.   Image: Historic buildings enliven the streetscape along the Dallas Transitway Mall.    Dallas   The phenomenon of central business district revitalization advancing hand in hand with the growth of the regional rail transit system is evident in Dallas and reinforces the essential interdependence of these phenomena. Downtown Dallas is determined to recover its former preeminent position as the region's center of employment, services, entertainment, and amenities, and to reestablish the downtown's interaction with its historic urban neighborhoods and first-ring suburbs.   COMMUNITY HISTORY   Dallas began as a humble trading post on 614 acres at the fork of the Trinity River. Although for decades it was scoffed at as a ""one-horse town,"" Dallas experienced a population explosion with the coming of the Texas and Pacific Railroad in 1872. Thereafter, it quickly developed as a premier center of banking and commerce and an international gateway for the oil and livestock trades, as well as a center for retail, new technologies of the day such as the telegraph, and culture.   When a headquarters for the Magnolia Petroleum Company was built in the 1920s, it was the tallest building in Texas, and remained so for two decades. Dallasites routinely bragged that it was the biggest building south of Washington, D.C. Its striking rooftop oil derrick holding a huge neon red Pegasus -- now rebuilt and again lighting the evening sky -- continues to serve as an icon of the city's past.   Brash, business-savvy, and family-friendly Dallas has long been one of the country's choice places to live. Its unique blend of bright city lights and downhome Texas culture complement an uncanny ability to recover economically from setbacks that might send other cities reeling, from the S&L crisis of the 1980s to the more recent national plummet of the high-tech sector. Banking, fashion, film, and innovative retail and restaurant concepts such as the Container Store and Chili's chain of restaurants have kept Dallas's economic base secure.   The very strengths of this booming Texas city have presented challenges to its development of a mature identity and sense of its own history. Dallas began to define this identity for itself earlier in the century when it adopted the central elements of the Kessler Plan, an early growth management model for the city created in 1911. Initially intended to address the periodic and problematic flooding of the Trinity River, the Kessler plan also created marvelous green space in central Dallas and developed a straightforward grid for downtown.   But the deeply rooted regard for private property and business development rights, local zoning that strongly promoted single-use development, and abundant land at the city's fringes have made big exurban development irresistible in Big D. In the inner city, teardowns and demolitions were the order of the day during much of the 1960s and 1970s in the name of progress, defined by increased auto access to and from downtown via North Central Expressway and other highways and arterials. In and around downtown, many historic areas were simply bypassed and important contributing buildings were boarded up or underused, resulting in at least partial ""mothballing"" of some of Dallas's finest historic resources.   The sense that preservation of historic structures was vital to the city's well being grew in Dallas during the 1970s and 1980s, as in most American cities, in response to the loss or neglect of important landmarks. The first historic preservation ordinance was adopted in 1973, establishing a landmarks commission and the Swiss Avenue Historic District. The West End Historic District in downtown was created shortly thereafter. The demolition of the elegant Art Deco Dr. Pepper headquarters on Mockingbird Lane in 1996, just days after it was designated a local landmark -- and the near-loss of its locally beloved clock tower, showing the traditional Dr. Pepper break times of 10, 2, and 4 -- stimulated interest in a stronger historic preservation ordinance for the City of Dallas. Today the tower still stands in front of a sensitively designed Kroger's grocery store on the old Dr. Pepper site, and across the street from Mockingbird Station, a mixed-use transit station redevelopment.   In 1996 Councilwoman Veletta Forsythe Lill convened a coalition of preservationists, developers, and other citizens to develop a new ordinance that strengthened protections for historic places, revised the rules for historic designations, and established a preservation fund. The City Council unanimously passed the ordinance in January 2000. The combination of a stronger preservation ordinance, city property tax abatements, and federal historic preservation tax credits has stimulated greater interest among private developers in restoration and adaptive reuse of many downtown Dallas landmarks. A former department store was developed into residences and an urban campus for six different colleges. The beautiful Majestic Theatre and many other significant historic structures have been renovated and adaptively reused in the downtown Dallas revitalization campaign. The Central Dallas Association, with over 150 member companies, promotes the interests of downtown and works closely with city government, DART, and other public-private partners on behalf of economic growth and revitalization.   Image: Southside on Lamar transforms the historic Sears Catalog Center into a major mixed-use, mixed-income transit oriented development.   Former Mayor Ron Kirk wrote last year about the mix of motivations that are promoting historic preservation in Dallas. In addition to the obvious contributions to economic development prompted by attractive tax incentives, there is also a growing realization in Dallas that ""the places of our past add to the fabric of our community. The past is becoming a part of our future."" Kirk and others acknowledge the work of an extensive public-private partnership that includes DART, city government, the business community, creative developers, dedicated homeowners in the historic districts, and private organizations such as Preservation Dallas and the Friends of Fair Park.    TRANSPORTATION   Dallas area voters rejected the idea of an area-wide transit system for Dallas and Fort Worth in the late 1970s, largely because the proposal was too expensive, premature, and not particularly well thought out. But by 1983 Dallas voters and those from thirteen other cities in the area had approved a one-cent sales tax dedicated to the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) for public transit. Citizens also exercised patience and understanding during the 13 years it took to plan, build, and open the 20-mile light rail starter system.   The North Central (12.3 miles) and Northeast (11.2 miles) corridor extensions opened in 2002, under budget and six months ahead of schedule. The expansion to North Dallas, Richardson, Garland, and Plano underscores the authentic regional nature of the DART rail system. The opening of the stations brings the DART system to 44 miles and 34 stations, completing one of the largest rail expansion projects in North America.   An article in the May 2001 issue of  Urban Land  noted that public transit in Dallas has become ever more important as traffic conditions and air quality have grown steadily worse. Traffic delays in Dallas increased by 37 percent between 1995 and 1999. Population in the region grew by 10 percent while vehicle miles traveled increased by 18 percent. The Dallas central business district was in deep decline as jobs moved further from the city core.   Community leaders and voters embarked on an ambitious plan to build 96 miles of light rail by 2016, 22 miles of commuter rail, and 110 miles of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes; as well as to undertake related efforts, including Intelligent Transportation Systems and Travel Demand Management. The plan included aggressive economic development along light rail corridors to promote transit use and rebuild downtown and urban neighborhoods.   In 2000, 77 percent of area voters approved a $2.4 billion bond issue, the largest of its kind ever approved in Texas, to expand and accelerate DART's light rail system. The bonds are guaranteed by future sales tax revenues. A Federal Transit Administration Full Funding Grant Agreement of $333 million under the New Starts Program is a critical element in the financial arrangements supporting the current doubling of the DART light rail starter system. The starter system alone has exceeded everyone's expectations in terms of ridership and economic development. While recession and job losses in the region produced a 10.5 percent drop in bus ridership in 2002, a 19.3 percent increase in DART rail and a 58.3 percent rise in trips on Trinity Railway Express helped keep systemwide ridership declines to just under 2 percent.   A recession-induced decline in sales tax revenues, which represents 88 percent of DART's income, may force another one-year delay in the next phase of its light rail expansion of 22 miles and 16 stations northwest to Carrollton and southeast to Buckner Boulevard. Part of the expansion anticipates federal financial participation through the New Starts Program and part will be supported with local funds.   Image: Historic buildings at the former Sears Catalog facility are part of the Matthews Southwest transit-oriented development at DART's Cedars Station.   DART's system expansion plans and its other improvements are in a foot race with clogged roads and deteriorating air quality. In addition to light rail expansion, DART's growing miles of HOV lanes, investments that reduce emissions from the bus fleet, pedestrian and bus access to the rail system, and development in the vicinity of transit stations are working together to lower the rate of growth of vehicle miles traveled.    DOWNTOWN DALLAS NOW   Centered on Main Street and the mixed-use infill and redevelopment projects nearby, downtown Dallas is being transformed. The principal ingredients are light rail and attractive, convenient access between the light rail system and retail, offices, residences, government and personal services, entertainment, and amenities.   The Central Business District's light rail corridor -- the Transitway Mall -- is the spine of DART's system and reflects the transit agency's commitment to the reestablishment of Dallas as the hub of the region's economic, social, and cultural life. Historic Dallas Union Station and a major bus transfer station near the West End transit stop provide intermodal connections. Stations are within walking distance of major employers and attractions, and are connected to many bus routes.   Joel Warren Barna wrote in  Texas Architect  in 1999 that DART's economic development operations since the 1980s have been based on the concept that public-private partnerships -- directly supporting rail transit -- can create new patterns of urban development. DART has in effect seeded its own operating efficiency by stimulating greater density around its stations and their adjacent neighborhoods.    FINANCING TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT   Like many cities in America, Dallas and its sister cities in North Texas make extensive use of tax increment financing for needed public improvements in areas adjacent to transit stations. City, county, and school districts forgo revenue increases on the growing value of property in the TIF districts and agree instead to devote new revenues to paying off bonds that provide public improvements within the district.    AWALT BUILDING   The six-story, 65,000-square-foot Awalt Building stands adjacent to DARTs CBD Transitway Mall at the West End Station, the system's busiest, and is home to Slingshot Communications' 50 employees, a ground-floor restaurant, and other commercial tenants. Built in the early years of the 20th century, the building was abandoned in the 1980s. When Slingshot started looking for a new home downtown, the Awalt was in the worst shape of all the buildings the company looked at and required the greatest leap of faith. Now Slingshot boasts that the building is ""located on the corner of the 19th and 21st centuries"" and has made the building's renovation for high-tech use a cornerstone of its company identity (to view information about the Awalt Building on Slingshot's web site, go to  http://www.davidandgoliath.com/awalt.asp ).   Slingshot Communications wanted to be downtown, particularly in the West End. It worked with the Dallas Landmarks Commission's West End Task Force, and was greatly influenced by the presence of light rail on the doorstep of the Awalt Building, and by the location's pedestrian-friendly character.   The City of Dallas was greatly interested in the redevelopment of this dilapidated eyesore. Slingshot Communications sought advice from a full range of city officials, especially those responsible for historic preservation projects, before making an offer to the Awalt's owner. The advertising agency was able to move into its top-floor office space just ten months after purchase. Extensive early consultations, hiring the services of an architect experienced in historic preservation work, and maintaining a good working relationship with city officials, helped keep Slingshot's surprises to a minimum.   Challenges to the project included reconciling historic preservation requirements with universal access needs under the Americans with Disabilities Act, plus other unexpected costs, but the company's attitude was, ""Why buy a 1905 building if you don't want it to look like a 1905 building?"" Federal historic preservation tax credits and a ten-year abatement of city and county property taxes helped to make the numbers work, and the company became an owner-tenant of the building with monthly mortgage payments no greater than the rent it had previously paid. Twenty percent of Slingshot's employees use transit, and the company provides both a transit benefit and reimburses transit riders for a few lunches per month.   Jeremy Leonard of Slingshot tells the story of a restaurant that expressed interest in the ground-floor commercial space but held off making an offer in order to reexamine demographics. A short time later, the restaurant signed a letter of intent. All it really needed to do, the restaurant said, was to count the number of people who passed the location every day, on foot and light rail, who would be reading its on-site advertising.    Image: The historic Awalt Building was in serious disrepair when Slingshot Communications purchased the building for adaptive reuse.    SOUTHSIDE ON LAMAR   Adjacent to DART's Cedars Station, immediately southeast of downtown, Matthews Southwest has developed a 39-acre parcel, the centerpiece of which is the historic nine-story Sears Catalog Center, opened in 1910. The $75 million development includes 455 lofts that occupy 900,000 square feet, 120,000 square feet of office space, and 34,000 square feet for retail and other arts related uses in a ground-floor retail arcade running the length of the building along a former railroad tunnel.   In addition to federal historic preservation tax credits and property tax abatements from the city, Matthews Southwest secured a low interest loan from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in return for setting aside 20 percent of the 455 lofts for below-market-rate rentals. All of these incentives helped make the financing possible. The Sears Catalog Center and other buildings within the old Sears compound had been designated both Dallas and National Historic Landmarks.   South Side at Lamar has stimulated other economic development projects in the immediate vicinity of Cedars Station, including a new Dallas police headquarters, an $18 million Gilleys country-western entertainment complex in two existing structures, and other entertainment and amenity facilities.   Both historic preservation and easy access to public transit have made this major development possible. Pete Coughlin, development coordinator for the project, observed, ""DART was a key in getting the project funded and in bringing people here. We are creating a 24-hour environment, and DART makes that possible."" Coughlin also remarked that residents enjoy living in an historic building and appreciate its historic interior features: fluted columns, natural ceilings, original maple floors, and exposed brick walls.    PLANO   At first a small farming community, Plano developed into a city in the 1870s after the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. From 1907 to 1948 it was connected to Dallas, its neighbor to the south, by the North Texas Interurban. After the demise of rail service and an explosion of residential growth to the north and west, Plano's old downtown stagnated. Light rail service has returned to Plano along the same right-of-way that promoted its growth late in the 19th century, and helped sustain it through the first half of the 20th.    Anticipating the arrival of light rail, Plano has been planning and preparing for years to transform downtown back into a transit village. The city's turn-of-the-century historic district is adjacent to the new Plano Station, and restoration of the city's historic structures in the station area is a conscious part of the redevelopment plan supported by a tax increment financing district and property tax abatements.    In addition to restoring historic resources, Plano approved a major new development called East Side Village, designed to match the historic character of the surrounding 19th century architecture. East Side Village contains 500 residential units, 40,000 square feet of retail and commercial space, and a 2,000-square-foot city conference center. Apartments rent from $600 to $1,200 per month. Plano's station area development is pedestrian-friendly and in harmony with the principles of the modern transit village.    ""Our goal is to transform downtown Plano into an urban, transit-oriented town center by expanding business, housing, and the arts within one-quarter mile of the station,"" says Frank Turner, executive director of the Plano Development Business Center. In support of Plano's plan, the DART station has bus bays and a kiss-and-ride, but no long-term parking. The station is designed to fit the look and feel of the downtown. A municipal center, courthouse, and school district offices are within walking distance, as are a park and single-family homes.    MCKINNEY AVENUE TROLLEY   The redevelopment of McKinney Avenue in Uptown Dallas in the early 1980s included restoration of its brick pavement. During the work, the double tracks of an old streetcar line were unearthed. Volunteers from the retail and business community donated funds to determine the feasibility of reinstating the trolley in the neighborhood. The McKinney Avenue Transit Authority was created in 1983, and four vintage streetcars were purchased and carefully restored.    In 1989, for the first time in 33 years, a streetcar ran under its own power on 2.8 miles of newly restored tracks on McKinney Avenue. The big news for devotees of historic trolleys as well as transportation choice advocates is that the McKinney Avenue Trolley is now linked at its northern end to DART's light rail system at the Cityplace station. DART patrons can transfer to the streetcar to tour McKinney Avenue restaurants, art galleries, boutiques, and the new West Village -- a transit village that combines condominium residences with upscale shopping and dining.    MATA expects to construct another expansion in the near future, southward to link up with the West End Historic District. The Texas Department of Transportation has allocated a total of $6.4 million of its federal transportation enhancements funds to help the non-profit organization that owns and operates the trolley.    TRINITY RAILWAY EXPRESS (TRE)   Dallas and Fort Worth created the Trinity Railway Express to reestablish a commuter rail connection that linked them together from 1902 to 1934, when the Northern Texas Traction Company shut down its intercity line. In autumn 2001, full service resumed between the cities' two historic passenger terminals, Dallas Union Station and the Texas and Pacific Railroad Station in Fort Worth.    Dallas and Fort Worth jointly purchased the old Rock Island Line right-of-way in 1983 for $34 million and created TRE as a joint venture of their transit agencies. Service was inaugurated on the line's first leg at the end of 1996, from Dallas Union Station west to South Irving. This phase was funded largely from DART's one percent sales tax, Federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) grant funds, and the sale of usage rights to rail freight operators.    Tarrant County, for which Fort Worth is the county seat, assumed responsibility for the $184 million needed for the 25-mile second phase of the project, using a combination of Federal Transit Administration New Starts and other program funds, a second CMAQ grant, sales tax receipts from Fort Worth and the other area cities sharing the service.    TRE has become very popular. Ridership grew by 58 percent in the first year of full operations, to over 2 million, supported in part by the train's impressive intermodal, downtown connections.    In Dallas, TRE links up with DART's Red and Blue Lines at Union Station. Fort Worth built a new centrally located Intermodal Transit Center that also serves Amtrak and Greyhound Bus and provides bus and shuttle connections to major Fort Worth destinations. TRE offers shuttle bus service to DFW airport from one of its stations to help attract riders from among the over 50,000 people who are employed at or near DFW. A combined DART and TRE Victory Station is under construction just west of the West End in Dallas, adjacent to American Airlines Center, the home of the Dallas professional basketball and hockey teams. A temporary TRE station presently offers service to the teams' home games.    Extension of TRE and the development of additional commuter rail service figure prominently in multimodal transportation planning throughout the Metroplex, but especially in Fort Worth, where the future rail component of the city's transportation plan decision is still evolving.    Lessons learned   •  Historic buildings in the central business district are important orientation points for rail station siting.  DART's station site decisions in the 1980s took into account the major redevelopment of the West End Historic District and Dallas's Union Station to put the ""there back there"" as the rail system was put back in place.   •  Business developers can -- and do -- support transit-oriented revitalization if the public sector sends the right signals and offers incentives.  Dallas, DART, participating cities, and NCTCOG understand the benefits of promoting economic development in station areas. Transit-related zoning and land use plans, special financial incentives, investment in public infrastructure, and urban design concepts are being used to counter the region's overall sprawling, autocentric development patterns. DART reaches out to developers to make their work easier. ""We provide education, coordination with member cities, connections to other developers,"" says Jack Wierzenski, assistant vice president of economic development and planning for DART. ""We accommodate developers any way we can.""   •  Strong historic preservation ordinances enhance and clarify the climate for private development.  Dallas's new preservation ordinance sends a clear signal to private developers that historic resources are valued and irreplaceable elements in the city's fabric. The ordinance's establishment of a preservation fund, along with stronger tests for demolition, combines with municipal property tax abatements and other supportive city measures to stimulate investment in restoration and adaptive reuse of many downtown Dallas landmarks.    Signs of success   Improved access provided by DART rail stations is enhancing nearby residential and office property valuations, according to 2002 research conducted by the University of North Texas Center for Economic Development and Research. From 1997 to 2001, residential properties near DART rail stations increased in value by 39 percent more on average than comparable properties not served by rail. Office buildings near DART rail lines increased in value 53 percent more than comparable properties elsewhere. According to the Dallas Association of Realtors, ""DART has been a huge economic driver in the region, and it will continue to be as the rail system expands and matures.""    Now DART is also working to redress development gaps between stations. One such area is the Good Latimer Transit Mall/Deep Ellum Gateway, an area caught between the central business district and the busy arts and residential district of Deep Ellum. ""Our goal is to design a station that is conducive to future development,"" says Jack Wierzenski, of DART. "" Since we're not yet sure what developers will want to do, we're preparing the station to be very flexible and accessible. When developers come in, they'll find not barriers but accommodation. ""Reinvestment in historic properties is contributing greatly to downtown's rebirth. The pragmatism generated by tax breaks, the emerging demand for loft-style housing in the heart of the city, and opportunities for creative mixed uses of older commercial buildings has helped to build a residential community of 17,000 in downtown Dallas where none existed before. Neighborhoods near downtown also benefit. Ken Hughes, president of UC Urban and the developer of the creative and highly acclaimed mixed-use project at Mockingbird Station (near where the old Dr. Pepper plant once stood), says: ""The proximity of the DART station and the growing ridership made the Mockingbird Station attractive and doable, and we're not doing it halfway.""    Not only are occupancy and rental rates increasing in buildings near stations throughout the system, tenants are returning to downtown from the suburbs. For example, the professional services firm KPMG, which moved out of downtown in 1992, returned a decade later and now occupies twice as much office space as before, in a building just steps from the St. Paul Station on the Transitway Mall. According to the firm that arranged the move, DART was one of the key ingredients for the consolidation of KPMG back downtown.    Fort Worth   Fort Worth, like other returning cities, understands that its central business district is its preeminent urban village: an economically, culturally, and socially vibrant center that binds the larger community together and helps to build civic identity through its powerful sense of place. As the center city prospers, private and public investment ripples out into surrounding neighborhoods.   Fort Worth's plan for revitalization recognizes that transportation investment must be directed toward a system to manage movement within a denser urban form, so that vibrant economic growth is not strangled by the kind of mobility it generates. The city's current plan for downtown transportation is multimodal, features convenient and attractive access among modes, and relies on good public transit and good walking streets.   Historic preservation is an important part of the city's comprehensive plan and greatly influences the way the city looks at itself and its future. The city preserves historic resources to protect its quality of life, its pride of place and its sense of community. Fort Worth is committed to passing its rich and colorful history on to future generations.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   Established in 1849, Fort Worth began as an army outpost and soon became the last major stop on the legendary Chisholm Trail, the dusty path where millions of cattle were driven North to market. Downtown Fort Worth came to be known as ""Hell's Half Acre,"" a rowdy district catering to the rough cowboy trade, with gambling parlors, saloons, and dance halls. The railroad era transformed the Fort Worth Stockyards into a premier livestock center, and downtown Fort Worth grew in complexity and sophistication.   When oil began to gush in West Texas, Fort Worth was at the center of the burgeoning oil industry. Still known affectionately as ""Cowtown,"" Fort Worth has preserved the architecture and rich heritage of its downtown through numerous redevelopments, including Sundance Square, a 20-block area featuring some of Fort Worth's oldest and architecturally unique structures, mostly turn-of-the-century storefronts. Some 50 shops, restaurants, theatres, bars, and clubs are all within walking distance of each other in Sundance Square, enhanced by attractive landscaping and brick-paved streets.   Sundance Square and its developers, the Fort Worth Bass family, are credited with launching downtown revitalization in the early 1980s. The critical truth embedded in the Bass family approach to Sundance Square is the realization that first-rate historic preservation makes first-rate places, not just in terms of buildings and streets but also the way that the denizens of the returning city use these places. Before the Bass family invested in Fort Worth's Sundance Square, the area's historic resources suffered from neglect.   In an essay published in the March 2002 issue of  Urban Land  magazine, Ed Bass stated an urban redevelopment principle that can be used to test the soundness of revitalization planning generally, especially as its transportation component is being devised. ""Cities need to learn to capitalize on their streets, city blocks, sidewalks, storefronts, and the comings and goings of a whole variety of people engaged in a whole gamut of activities.""   From the early 1980s to the late 1990s, more than $850 million in private investment was pumped into Sundance Square, with most of the risk being assumed by the Bass brothers. The extent of their investment guaranteed that the place would have the look and feel they were aiming to create. As a result, the northern end of downtown Fort Worth has 20 movie screens, an assortment of nightclubs and live theater venues, office space, several dozen restaurants, hotels, retail tenants like Barnes and Noble, and a significant infusion of new residents.   The city has also played a principal role in downtown transformation, pumping nearly $300 million in public funds into downtown projects, including federal grants. Special taxing districts have been created, property tax abatements have assisted many projects, and active organizations representing the private revitalization stakeholders, like Historic Fort Worth and Downtown Fort Worth, help round out the public-private partnership that is a hallmark of success in so many urban revitalization efforts.    TRANSPORTATION   The City of Fort Worth and the Fort Worth Transportation Authority (the T) jointly developed a Fort Worth Light Rail Streetcar Starter Project, a 7.6-mile, double-tracked streetcar system intended to connect Fort Worth's Intermodal Transportation Center, the Trinity Railway Express, and new bus transfer facilities downtown with Fort Worth's employment centers, major destinations, and neighborhoods. The starter project was endorsed by the City Council and the T in 2002 as the first phase of a larger streetcar system that could be implemented over the next 20 to 30 years.   The 2002 decision has been placed on hold pending a review of transportation priorities by the city's new administration. Also on hold is Fort Worth's formal application for a $92.5 million Federal Transit Administration New Starts grant, representing 50 percent of the project's total cost, for the city's locally preferred alternative, a project designed to link the central business district with the city's cultural and medical districts and several central city neighborhoods. The city's 50 percent of the project cost is expected to come from flexible federal sources like the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality program, local transit sales tax revenues (half-cent as opposed to DART's 1-cent), and $62.5 million from municipal bonds. A citywide election will be needed to approve the municipal bonds, and the availability of flexible federal transportation funds is subject to the approval of the regional council of governments.    MAKING THE TOD CONNECTION   Fort Worth's extensive urban revitalization efforts are closely tied to an eventual multimodal, interdependent transportation system that will facilitate and encourage walking and good connections for the city's buses. The automobile's primacy in the city is not going to be supplanted, but investment in alternative travel choices to and from resurgent neighborhoods, downtown, and the city's key activity centers will ease auto congestion, improve air quality, and offer the capacity to reduce vehicle miles traveled.   The New Starts application, in its present form, emphasizes the regional transportation connections that light rail will give Fort Worth, its conformity to regional land use and sustainable development goals, and a firm commitment to the principles of genuine transit- oriented development: mixed use, mixed income, greater density at and near transit stops, and the best walking connections possible. The city has already enacted two mixed-use zoning classifications that are transit-supportive and consistent with the package of revitalization efforts.   Image: Meticulously restored historic buildings within Sundance Square bear out the Bass family belief that first-rate historic preservation makes first-rate places.    LANCASTER AVENUE AND THE TEXAS AND PACIFIC PASSENGER TERMINAL   When an elevated segment of I-30 was torn down in 2002 and its replacement completed further south, the uncovering of Lancaster Avenue opened up an opportunity to reunite downtown. The street is a wide expanse of road that is beautifully suited to transformation into an elegant urban boulevard. Along Lancaster Avenue are architectural gems, isolated since the 1960s by a segment of I-30 that was elevated freeway, and now ready for restoration and reuse. A refurbished, beautified, and pedestrian friendly Lancaster Avenue could connect the southern end of downtown to the city's expanding cultural district just to the west.   The present terminus of TRE in Fort Worth is the Texas and Pacific Rail Passenger terminal, one of the city's premier historic landmarks. The Fort Worth Transportation Authority, which owns the first-floor waiting room and adjacent boardroom, restored them with federal transportation enhancements funding granted by the Texas Department of Transportation. The terminal building's owners tried unsuccessfully to convince the city to help renovate the upper floors into a hotel. Plans are now underway to develop those floors into 130 apartments while adding a four-story, 92-unit apartment building and parking garage east of the terminal. Both Fort Worth and Tarrant County have agreed to grant historic tax exemptions for the project.   Fort Worth's starter light rail streetcar, as presently envisioned, would connect with the T&P terminal on its north-south axis from the Sundance Square- Tarrant County Court House area to the Medical District. The terminal's restoration for in-town living is expected to quicken private revitalization efforts in the Lancaster Avenue corridor.    FORT WORTH RAIL MARKET   Public and private restoration and revitalization activities are also in full swing in Fort Worth's midtown section. Just south of the new Intermodal Transit Center (ITC), the historic Santa Fe Warehouse has been restored and reopened as the Fort Worth Rail Market. In a 23,000-square-foot canopied space between the rail market and the ITC, the T and the Fort Worth Rail Market operate an outdoor farmers' market on weekends during spring and summer. According to the market's web site ( http://www.fortworthrailmarket.com ) ""The Fort Worth Rail Market ... builds on the synergy created by other downtown developments, including the Intermodal Transportation Center (ITC), Fort Worth Convention Center expansion, the Convention Center Plaza, Water Garden and Hyde Park improvements, and the Lancaster Avenue Redevelopment.""   The Market was constructed in 120 days and opened on May 25, 2002. More than 40,000 square feet of permanent retail space is available for up to twenty year-round tenants. The expanded convention center is nearby, and Fort Worth's light rail streetcar will serve the area as the TRE already does. The city, in a partnership with the T, the U.S. General Services Administration, and Downtown Fort Worth, Inc, is also planning a new Downtown Civic Square on the site of historic 19th century Hyde Park. Only a few blocks from the Santa Fe Rail Market, the civic square will be an important element in the mix of transit- and pedestrian-connected attractions and destinations in the mid-town section of Fort Worth.

Signs of success   Fort Worth's long-discussed and much-planned light rail trolley is still years away from operation, but the urban revitalization it is being designed to serve and sustain is well underway. The urban model that NCTCOG sees as a means to build up centers of mixed-use development throughout the region has been working over the last 25 years in center city Fort Worth. Studies of the city have identified a demand for city living and a growing residential market. Both Pier 1 and Radio Shack are constructing new national headquarters downtown, and Fort Worth's nightlife is vibrant, especially in Sundance Square. Public investments in services and amenities abound. Old and historic buildings are being restored and reused.   Just one year after its grand opening, the Fort Worth Rail Market is now home to a lively mix of specialty food stores, other retail establishments, and small independent restaurants. Four retail spaces remain to be leased. David Pettit, director of development for Downtown Fort Worth, Inc., states ""Current negotiations with a butcher, sausage, and deli vendor will complete the desired tenant mix outlined in the original plans for the Market. Additionally, negotiations are underway for the second floor restaurant space, offering 5,500 square feet of intimate, indoor dining and an additional 5,000 square feet of patio dining overlooking downtown."" The restaurant is scheduled to open early this fall. In attracting new tenants and seasonal vendors, the management of the Rail Market has made much of nearby transportation connections and the historic value of the site and nearby attractions. Citing the 10,000 daily boardings on the Trinity Railway Express and the status of the ITC as the transportation hub for all of Tarrant County, the Fort Worth Rail Market also positions to prospective vendors as part of the ""downtown synergy"" that includes a mix of old and new Fort Worth, from Sundance Square to the new convention center, both just minutes away.    Lessons learned   •  Private, independent, ""isolated"" efforts at downtown revitalization do pay big dividends in later efforts toward transit-supportive development.  Sundance Square and its developers, the Fort Worth Bass family, are credited with launching downtown revitalization in the early 1980s. According to Urban Land magazine, Fort Worth affirms the urban development theory that medium-sized cities ""should focus on a specific district for revitalization, concentrating efforts to produce critical mass and more visible results."" Fort Worth has demonstrated how returning cities can expand the experiences of individual district revitalization to other parts of downtown.   •  Transit agencies should seek opportunities to lead and develop historic downtown areas that could serve and be served by transit.  The Fort Worth Transportation Authority and leaders of the ITC effort not only were ""plugged in"" to develop trends and opportunities in downtown, they took leadership roles in clearing the way for transit-oriented development near the ITC and other downtown transportation facilities.       Back to top   Denver, Colorado   Blueprint for a Living City   DOWNTOWN STRATEGY BUILDS ON EARLIER EFFORTS   Denver, Colorado is undergoing a renaissance of transportation choices and downtown revitalization, thanks to 40 years of visionary planning and energetic community efforts. Blueprint Denver, created in 2002, is a growth and transportation strategy for promoting and protecting the city's livability, with an emphasis on the interdependence of downtown with the historic residential neighborhoods that surround it. The citywide strategy within Blueprint Denver is focused on absorbing 109,000 new jobs and 132,000 more residents by 2022.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   Built in the boom years of the mid-19th century, downtown Denver suffered from decreasing investment after the silver bust of 1893, a trend that accelerated with the ascendancy of the automobile in the first half of the 20th century. In 1965, real estate developer Dana Crawford launched a 20-year effort to save downtown from dereliction and slum clearance. Her early successes helped create a strong preservation ethic in Denver. By 1971, the city had both a landmarks commission and a private nonprofit organization, Historic Denver, Inc. In 1974 the city rezoned Lower Downtown-a threatened treasure trove of industrial and commercial architecture-for mixed use, including loft apartments and retail. A second rezoning in 1982 offered incentives for property owners to preserve historic buildings. After a seven-year struggle, Lower Downtown was designated a historic district in 1989. Denver promptly established the Lower Downtown Business Support Office to market the area to investors and manage a loan fund to help with gap financing, facade improvements, and upgrades required by building codes.   Even these positive steps still proved inadequate to stem the development pressure on downtown Denver, where high rises were being built right beside historic structures. In 2000, the city created the Downtown Denver Historic District to protect and preserve 43 historic buildings in the central business district. Many of the protected buildings were already rehabilitated and in use when the designation took effect. The new district includes the 16th Street transit mall, an international model for integrating mixed use development, transit, and historic preservation.   The city's efforts to revitalize its core and protect its historic character now have radiated beyond the boundaries of downtown. According to former Mayor Wellington Webb, who stepped down after three terms in 2003, ""In downtown Denver, our history ... exists comfortably and proudly side by side with our present."" Webb convened two major summits to look at how to integrate business development, transportation, housing, and historic preservation in downtown. Under his leadership, the city made sweeping changes to its zoning to encourage housing and transit-oriented development in the central business district. The city also established an office specifically to market its inventory of historic and older downtown buildings to housing developers, providing developers and investors with accurate information about properties and market conditions.   The latest manifestation of Denver's efforts to protect and enhance its downtown is Blueprint Denver, which was approved by the City Council in March 2002 by a vote of 11 to l. Blueprint Denver seeks to confront the major planning issues associated with integrating land use and transportation planning -- the first step to sound growth management.    Image: REI skillfully restored and adapted the historic Denver Tramway Power Company Building for use as its Denver flagship store.     BLUEPRINT DENVER   Blueprint Denver identifies areas of stability and areas of change where growth and transit investment can be channeled to improve access to jobs, housing, and services while decreasing auto trips. Downtown Denver is an area of change and its population could grow by 30 percent during the next 20 years. Areas of stability in the plan are primarily established residential neighborhoods and their associated commercial areas. City planners have asked Denver's 77 neighborhoods to develop their own mini-blueprints. The goal of planning for these areas of stability is to let them identify and maintain their particular character while accommodating new development and redevelopment.   A focal point of Blueprint Denver's transportation strategy is to support transit-oriented development (TOD) at existing and planned stations on light-rail lines serving the city. The strategy is designed to preserve historic neighborhoods and reuse historic and architecturally significant downtown buildings. Historic buildings of the type found in downtown Denver -- mostly old warehouses and industrial/commercial spaces -- are ideally suited to retail, office space, and condo- or apartment-style housing. The city makes financing available for unconventional housing projects, and is directing its private activity bond allocations toward housing.    ""My first Downtown Summit in 1991 rallied city government and preservation and business constituencies to closer collaboration on two principal strategies: developing housing and expanding historic preservation as an economic development tool."" WELLINGTON WEBB MAYOR OF DENVER    Rehabilitation of historic buildings for housing has been underway in Denver for many years. Mayor Webb supported this effort, believing that the city's revitalization depends on establishing a residential population downtown. A mainstay of Webb's strategy was to emphasize transit access and walkable streets while controlling additional downtown parking.   Although Blueprint Denver does not change zoning, it sets in motion a process for a substantial revision of Denver's zoning code, which is essential to the plan's success and crucial to the achievement of regional transportation objectives.    PARTNERS AND LEADERS   Blueprint Denver was assembled with extensive participation by the city's transportation agency, members of the council, 46 members of an advisory committee, and many hundreds of other Denver citizens who appeared at public hearings, open houses in each of the 13 council districts, and neighborhood discussions.   Denver has a seven-county Regional Transportation District (RTD) with bonding authority to improve, maintain, and operate Denver's mass transit system. The RTD works with the region's metropolitan planning organization, the Denver Regional Council of Governments. The RTD recently took the lead in encouraging TOD by establishing a ""TOD shop"" to help developers move their projects along.    Two private nonprofit groups have been closely involved in shaping both Denver's historic preservation and its transit future: Historic Denver, Inc. (HDI) and the Downtown Denver Partnership, Inc. (DDP). HDI was founded by citizens in 1970 and has focused much of its attention on preservation of the urban core and close-in neighborhoods. DDP has represented downtown businesses, property owners, and employees since 1955, and has long advocated for transportation choices that support revitalization and historic preservation. DDP supports the region's current transit planning and the redevelopment of Union Station into an intermodal center.   The city has also been blessed with two mayors who placed priority on transit-oriented and preservation-minded revitalization downtown. In 1984 Mayor Federico Peña convened a committee of civic and business leaders to help plan the city's future. The committee and the mayor's sustained leadership were instrumental in designating Lower Downtown a historic district in 1988. Mayor Peña declared Lower Downtown the best opportunity for jump-starting the revitalization of downtown Denver, and made downtown historic district designation the number one issue for the city, backed by an extensive coalition of supporters.    TRANSPORTATION CHOICES   According to Jennifer Moulton, former director of the Community Planning and Development Agency, the objectives of Blueprint Denver are not only implementation of light rail along well-planned corridors, but also improved bus service, special highway High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes, commuter rail, and improved street design for walking and bicycling. The plan stresses the importance of residential and commercial activities near major transit stops.   The city's mass transit system includes more than 16 miles of light rail, the first segment of which began operation in 1994, and will total 35 miles on completion. Nearly 200 bus routes run throughout the region, serving 64 free park-and-rides and hundreds of bus stops. More than 65 bus trips per hour arrive in downtown Denver during peak periods.   Metropolitan Denver's Transportation Expansion Project (T-Rex), a $1.7 billion undertaking, consists of new light rail transit and highway improvements on I-25 between Denver and major destinations to the southeast of the city. T-Rex will reconstruct 17 miles of I-25, including bridges and interchanges, and is constructing 19 miles of double-track light rail with 13 transit stations in the Southeast Corridor to Douglas County, with a spur along I-225 in Arapahoe County. RTD and the Federal Transit Administration entered into a Full Funding Grant Agreement in November 2000, which committed $525 million in Section 5309 New Starts funds to the project.   Waiting in the wings for voter approval is RTD's accelerated 10-year plan that proposes to spend $4.3 billion for light rail, commuter rail, and express bus lanes in the Denver metropolitan area. RTD also proposes to double the number of parking spaces at stations along the existing southwest line and to double parking spaces planned for the T-Rex line in southeast Denver. The plan is being called ""Fastrack"" and must be approved by metro-area voters because of the 0.4 percent sales tax hike needed to help pay for it. It is likely to be on the ballot in 2004.    Image:  The magnificently restored Denver Dry Goods Building, a mixed-use project of the Jonathon Rose Companies, stands at the heart of multi-modal downtown Denver. The restoration took advantage of 23 sources of financing.    PROTECTING DENVER'S INNER-CITY NEIGHBORHOODS   Beginning in the early 1990s, large second-story additions or ""pop-tops"" became common in Denver's historic inner-city neighborhoods as owners sought ways to expand the typical two-bedroom Denver bungalow. This phenomenon of tear-downs or scrape-offs has become commonplace across the United States, and large suburban-style homes are replacing historic bungalows all over the nation. The National Trust for Historic Preservation attempted to draw national attention to the phenomenon by placing Teardowns on its 2002 List of America's Eleven Most Endangered Historic Places.   The zoning in many neighborhoods surrounding Denver's central business district permits much greater density than is currently in place. High-rise apartments and condominiums could destroy the character of the inner city's historic residential neighborhoods, with a density growth well above what existing residents are willing to tolerate. Blueprint Denver acknowledges that zoning in these areas of stability must be changed, and the city is working to effect these changes.   Blueprint Denver also envisions that the city's 77 neighborhoods will develop their own mini-blueprints. In some neighborhoods, local historic districts are being proposed. Along with stronger protections to prevent demolitions and out-of-scale additions, the advocates for these historic neighborhoods will also help identify appropriate infill sites and develop flexible guidelines to encourage compatible new construction.   Residents and preservationists in Denver have been successful in protecting the high-quality architecture, mature landscaping, and pedestrian orientation of traditional, historic neighborhoods. These neighborhoods radiate a powerful sense of place that benefits the city in terms of consumer reinvestment, community stability, and tourism.   The Denver Downtown Partnership has provided an overview of residential areas of downtown and some of Denver's close-in neighborhoods, some of which is quoted here.    DOWNTOWN: AREA OF CHANGE   There is a common perception that the majority of downtown Denver's housing growth during the 1990s happened in Lower Downtown. However, the rate of residential growth in the upper end of downtown -- in what is often referred to as the central business district -- has been on par with that of Lower Downtown. Upper Downtown has a population of approximately 3,000 people, while Lower Downtown's population is about 2,200.   In recent years, several vacant office buildings in the central business district of downtown Denver have been renovated into apartment and condominium projects along 15th, 16th, and 17th streets -- Baldwin Lofts, the Denver Dry Goods Building Lofts, the A.T. Lewis & Rio Grande Lofts, Boston Lofts, and Bank Lofts. Four of these projects include below-market-rate apartments for downtown's workforce. Two recent developments on Champa Street include the Buerger Brothers Industrial Lofts and the Chamber Apartments next door. The upper end of Downtown now has approximately 1,550 rental units and 650 for-sale units.    LOWER DOWNTOWN: AREA OF CHANGE   Lower Downtown -- or LoDo, as it is commonly called -- is in the oldest part of Denver, founded in 1858 by General William Larimer. Today LoDo is a vibrant 25-block urban neighborhood comprised of brick warehouses, industrial buildings and commercial structures that have been renovated into offices, lofts and retail space.   LoDo housing options range from million-dollar lofts to below-market rate apartments. New construction for housing has begun as the number of vacant buildings in Lower Downtown available for renovation shrinks to nearly zero.   The most notable construction projects in Lower Downtown are four new office buildings that were recently built on the former sites of surface parking lots. One of these developments -- 16 Market Square -- includes 25 residential lofts on its top floors.    DENVER INVESTS IN INTERMODALISM: UNION TERMINAL   Denver's Regional Transportation District (RTD) purchased Union Station in August 2001, along with 20 acres of adjacent prime real estate for just under $50 million, after about a year of intense negotiations with the station's three owners. The century-old rail facility, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, ranks among Denver's outstanding historic structures. It will become the heart and hub of a regional, multimodal transportation system and a premier destination in its own right in the midst of all sorts of destinations.    RTD's financial partners in the purchase are the City and County of Denver, and the Denver Regional Council of Governments that, along with the Colorado Department of Transportation, approved $23 million in federal funds. An impressive team, dubbed the Union Station Alliance, was assembled to develop a master plan for the depot and the surrounding 18.5 acres of land in accord with a multi-modal transportation vision that includes light rail, commuter rail, Amtrak, local and regional buses, the 16th Street mall shuttle, bicycle facilities, and taxi cab facilities.    The terminal will become the gateway to Denver, just as it was years ago when as many as 80 passenger trains pulled in each day. In an interview with the Denver Business Journal, Jennifer Moulton, the city's former planning director, called it Denver's ""front door"". A rail line to Denver International Airport, currently served by RTD buses to downtown, will be a part of the planning, as well as a link to the nearby Platte River Trolley, with its antique street cars.    CENTRAL PLATTE VALLEY: AREA OF CHANGE   The Central Platte Valley neighborhood is largely a blank slate at this time, a 120-acre expanse to the west of downtown Denver that is home to about 360 residential units. After spending most of this century marked by railyards, warehouses, viaducts, and garbage dumps, the Central Platte Valley area is evolving into an exciting, mixed-use urban neighborhood with more than 2,000 housing units, and more than 3 million square feet of offices, shops, restaurants, and hotels. The first housing units between Union Station and the South Platte River are now occupied and more are under construction.   In 2001, shuttle service on the 16th Street Mall was extended through Lower Downtown and behind Union Station to the Central Platte Valley. The extension brings closer access to the Millennium Bridge, a pedestrian span over the consolidated train track that remains in the Central Platte Valley. Central Platte Valley's residents have a 10-minute walk into Lower Downtown and Denver's central business district.   To enhance access in the area, there are plans to develop an intermodal facility that handles passenger trains, regional buses, light rail, and commuter rail, creating a downtown hub for Denver's metropolitan transportation system. A 1.5-mile light rail spur recently began operating in Central Platte Valley, linking the Auraria Higher Education Center and downtown, with stops at entertainment destinations (such as the Pepsi Center) and future housing and commercial developments.   Although the land on the east side of the South Platte River is now taking shape with the first phase of development, the west side of the Central Platte Valley between the river and I-25 has characteristic red-brick buildings with ground-floor retail and restaurants and residential lofts above. Commons Park West, a new construction 340-unit apartment complex, is the largest of recent developments.    Signs of success   In 1991 downtown Denver was full of boarded-up buildings. Today, more than 50 formerly derelict structures have been put back in service, mostly as downtown housing. The downtown has attracted $158 million in investment for historic preservation alone, including only $16 million in public funds. Virtually all of downtown Denver is already transit-oriented development.   More than 10 percent of the metropolitan region's workforce is employed in downtown Denver. Almost half of those workers commute to downtown via transit, carpooling, or other alternatives to driving. And 54,000 people use the 16th Street Transit Mall every weekday.   Construction of new residences and population have increased in and near downtown during the past decade -- the population of Lower Downtown alone doubled from about 1,000 mostly low-income residents in 1990 to about 2,500 with a much higher median income in 2000. The downtown's revenue base has also improved: Denver is the 20th largest city in the country but has the 10th largest downtown in terms of commercial and retail space.   For the most part, the neighborhoods near downtown have not experienced the cycles of serious disinvestment that usually plague inner-city neighborhoods in other communities. Denver's core neighborhoods, especially the historic ones, are increasingly popular among home buyers. More than 67,000 people live within a one mile radius of downtown in these neighborhoods. Prices are rising, with the result that the inner-ring neighborhoods are endangered by their own success. Many newcomers to the city's historic neighborhoods are altering or demolishing homes to build suburban-style dwellings with larger amounts of square footage. Through zoning controls and the Blueprint Denver effort, the city is moving decisively to support preservation of the scale and character of neighborhoods in and near downtown (see ""Protecting Denver's Inner-City Neighborhoods,"" page 27).    Lessons learned   • Build on previous efforts and successes in historic preservation, housing, transportation, and downtown revitalization.  Denver is drawing on a rich history of such efforts to bring in stake-holders and create new models for wedding transportation choices and sustainable development downtown.   • Promote individual leadership, and give credit where credit is due.  Without the early efforts of developers like Dana Crawford and preservationists like Lisa Purdy, and without the leadership and vision of Mayors Federico Pena and Wellington Webb, Denver's downtown might never have become the crown jewel it is today.   • Coordinate downtown efforts within a regional framework.  Planning and financial mechanisms are needed at a regional level to create, improve, and sustain a living downtown. Denver recognized this lesson in its early efforts to create a Lower Downtown historic district.

Although the city has made remarkable progress in offering transportation choices and a downtown design to support them, San Diego still struggles to develop employment and residential population in its center city and older, close-in neighborhoods. In a city renowned both for its excellent planning and its unique character, historic preservation has not become a serious organizing principle for revitalization efforts. Yet the benefits of historic preservation to the city are everywhere apparent.   San Diego was the first city on the West Coast to electrify its trolleys, and among the first to respond broadly to the problems our auto-dependent society has inflicted upon cities. The city reused old rail rights-of-way to create a new trolley system in the 1970s. Because these routes link historically significant destinations that still define the community's character today, San Diego's historic places are uniquely positioned to contribute to smart growth.   A major planning effort for the city, the City of Villages, could have a profound impact on historic resources in downtown and nearby neighborhoods. The San Diego Association of Governments, the metropolitan planning organization, estimates that the city's population will increase approximately 284,000 by 2020 and an additional 150,000 homes will be needed to house new residents. City of Villages was San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy's fundamental policy response to the land shortage and housing needs. The intent of City of Villages is to concentrate much of the needed growth in the city's established neighborhoods. Less than 10 percent of San Diego's 331 square miles is still raw, developable land. Additional housing has to compete with other demands in neighborhoods that want to control levels of density and congestion, address deteriorating public infrastructure, stimulate and maintain community services, and create attractive public spaces.   The City of Villages planning process has led downtown and neighborhood leaders to take a long look at the city core's needs and special character, and has prompted both the city and the Metropolitan Transit Development Board (MTDB) to consider ways to boost transit's contribution to downtown revitalization. Although City of Villages acknowledges the importance of neighborhood and civic character, historic resources, and transit-oriented design, historic preservation is not a fundamental pillar for planning.   Specific development projects may point the way toward a greater reliance on historic preservation as a means to smart growth and revitalization, at least in downtown and nearby neighborhoods. For example, construction of a new baseball park for the San Diego Padres illustrates the benefits of historic preservation to downtown revitalization and public transportation (see ""The Ballpark District,"" page 36). The new ballpark is located in a promising area of historic warehouses, adjacent to the city's world-renowned Gaslamp Quarter, a National Historic District.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   Founded on a site that had been inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years, including the La Jolla, Yuman, and Shoshonean, San Diego became a Spanish mission in 1602. The first colonists arrived 175 years later, including military families from the coastal fortress known as the Presidio. In the 1840s Americans gained a foothold in San Diego as a result of the winning of California by the United States and the 1848 gold rush. In 1850 downtown San Diego was established as New Town and the city was incorporated. Today the military and the Catholic Church are still active participants in San Diego's economy and culture, linking the city to its colonial past.   San Diego's transit history reaches back to the 1870s. Initially horsepowered, later expanded and electrified, the trolley system gave way to buses in the middle of the last century. The city's walkable downtown declined in proportion to suburban expansion, until by the late 1960s, downtown properties were not even generating enough tax revenue to cover basic city services.   In 1972, then-Mayor Pete Wilson outlined an aggressive program for revitalizing the physically and economically blighted downtown. Public and private redevelopment organizations pursued a plan to bring residents, retail, and commercial businesses back to downtown; create a strong job base; and reestablish downtown's premier role as a lively and attractive regional hub for employment, services, arts, culture, government, entertainment, and living.   The rebirth of the San Diego Trolley in the 1970s and the civic commitment to downtown revitalization advanced concurrently, one contributing to the success of the other. Downtown redevelopment required that the area be accessible from throughout the region, and light rail transit offered an additional travel choice reminiscent of days gone by. San Diego's historic and very popular Gaslamp Quarter was one of the earlier community revitalization efforts that helped to establish the role of historic preservation in the redevelopment plan.   Image: Outstanding restorations of the Gaslamp Quarter's historic buildings shape the area's character and contribute to its walkability.    TRANSPORTATION   In the 1970s California State Senator John Mills, a transit visionary and ardent historic preservationist, was instrumental in passing state legislation to bring light rail back to San Diego. The legislation created two revenue streams for light rail: a quarter-cent state sales tax rebated to local governments, and constitutional access to state gasoline taxes. The legislation also created the Metropolitan Transit Development Board (MTDB) to design and build the system.   The statute gave MDTB just five years to get the system up and running. With $18 million, MTDB quickly purchased 108 miles of existing railroad track, 32 miles of which became the first segments of the Blue and Orange lines. The new light rail system's initial segment was built with $12 million of state funds and $74 million from local sources.   The trolley system has been expanding ever since. The newest six-mile segment, the Mission Valley East LRT Extension, will provide access to major employment and activity destinations such as San Diego State University (SDSU) and the Alvarado Medical Center. The extension will also complete a northern outer loop by linking up the existing Blue and Orange lines.   Over 24,000 jobs and 10,000 residences are within walking distance of the extension's proposed stations. Current zoning is generally supportive of transit. Total capital costs for this extension are estimated at $431 million, including $330 million in Federal Transit Administration New Start Funds. Costs reflect construction of a 4,000-foot tunnel, an underground station 60 feet below the SDSU campus, and other features such as access to multiple destinations, park-and-ride lots, and road and pedestrian improvements.   The Metropolitan Transit Development Board has been promoting transit-oriented, joint-development projects from its earliest days. By 1985 MTDB was able to examine its experience with joint development and draw early conclusions, including a realization that transit-supportive development in the vicinity of light rail was not going to be a naturally occurring phenomenon, especially along existing rights-of-way.   Since MTDB did not own substantial amounts of developable land at its stations, joint ventures with adjacent land owners made sense. Success would depend on supportive public policies and an understanding of the needs of private developers who were willing to participate. Small-scale joint developments were worth pursuing because they generated revenues, provided visibility, and tended to make station areas more attractive to riders. Agreements among local governments were made easier by the fact that MTDB board members are locally elected officials from its entire service area.   To make transit more relevant to the region's population, the MTDB undertook TransitWorks, a market-based strategic planning program developed over a two-year period. Through extensive study of the attitudes and preferences that determine San Diego residents' travel choices, MTDB sought to understand individual decision making about transportation, to classify travelers into groups based on common attitudes and travel preferences, and to better understand the trade-offs travelers make when considering transit for different kinds of trips.   The TransitWorks exercise identified the service characteristics needed to attract new riders, and devised four different service concepts from short, neighborhood-level trips to trips of more than six miles. The process then developed a series of scenarios on the basis of how extensive service would have to be in order to attract different market segments. Cost estimates for each scenario were provided.   Image: San Diego Trolley stops bracket the city's Gaslamp Quarter and offer visitors travel choices.   The fourth scenario, labeled ""Transit First,"" envisions the San Diego region finally curbing its appetite for consuming land by more careful attention to the design of new development. Trolley service has been improved and expanded, and many areas are served by a network of bus rapid transit routes fed by a web of community and neighborhood transit connections. New services have focused on key employment sites, especially where auto congestion impedes the ability of employees to get to work. In the old and new neighborhoods, especially where improved pedestrian access exists, the potential for transit use has been enhanced because a high percentage of residents are able and willing to walk to stops.   The Metropolitan Transit Development Board estimates that implementation of Transit First could cost as much as $6.8 billion and acknowledges that much depends on taxpayers' assent to an extension of TransNet, the region's half percent sales tax for transportation, which expires in 2008. The Transit First option is being supported by the coordinated actions of the City of San Diego in implementing the City of Villages transit-oriented development plan.    CITY OF VILLAGES PLAN   City of Villages is designed to accommodate and channel future growth and address critical urban public policy issues such as affordable housing, traffic congestion, aging community infrastructure, public facilities, and land use. San Diego planners and a 40-member citizens committee managed an extensive public involvement process, including 150 public meetings and various workshops that led to a growth management strategy for over 40 of San Diego's neighborhoods.   At its heart, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune, the plan is a civic compact between local government officials and the citizens of the neighborhoods to accept more growth in the form of housing, shops, and offices concentrated into mixed-use developments in exchange for the city's commitment to deliver $2.5 billion worth of better community infrastructure, including sidewalks, public spaces, parks, libraries, and other long-sought public improvements.   Image: Attractive gateways into the Gaslamp Quarter enhance good walking streets.   City of Villages is also a blueprint for neighborhood revitalization that envisions places for many more people to live in mixed-use, mixed-income livable communities. The plan identifies the major features of great places: preservation of neighborhood character, historic and cultural resources, pedestrian-friendly streets and sidewalks, easy and safe access to transit, jobs, neighborhood amenities, public and commercial services, calmed traffic, and parking management plans.   According to Gail Goldberg, San Diego's planning director, the dialogue with neighborhoods was less about growth than it was about how to harness growth to attract amenities that were lacking in many older neighborhoods, such as transit, services, and civic spaces.   No one believes that the City of Villages strategy is going to be easy to implement. Lack of financial resources presents an obstacle that will call for public revenue increases to be put before the city's voters. Residents will be called upon to accept appropriate increases in density. California state law contains many obsolete barriers to implementation of smart growth principles that must be overcome, including how to successfully integrate community planning and school siting functions. City of Villages assumes that transit services will be an important implementation ingredient in the overall strategy.   For its part, MTDB is working to implement a Transit First pilot project that will provide service in much-traveled corridors that feature some of the city's recently short-listed City of Villages Pilot projects. The Transit First Showcase Project will provide residents of North Park, City Heights, and the College area with high-quality, rubber-tired transit connecting downtown San Diego to San Diego State University (SDSU) along Park and El Cajon Boulevards. This new kind of transit will offer the speed, comfort, and amenities of a trolley. Riders will be able to bypass traffic congestion because transit will travel in its own lanes and receive priority at signalized intersections. Stations will include upgraded shelters, passenger information and other features. New technology will allow passengers to pay for fares with debit cards (Smart Cards) and to know when the next transit vehicle will arrive. MTDB is also working to encourage transit-oriented development around 15 trolley stations.    DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO   San Diego's pedestrian-friendly central business district is well served by trolley and buses, but transit and redevelopment agencies are examining additional access and mobility options as they prepare for downtown's participation in the region's City of Villages program. The central business district is the most promising part of the region for an early City of Villages success. The presence of multimodal public transit-including two light rail lines, commuter rail, Amtrak, and many bus routes-along with limits on parking, Transportation Demand Management measures, regional destinations, and mixed land uses in a pedestrian-oriented setting, combine to make San Diego's center city a 1,500-acre transit-oriented development.    Downtown San Diego has the region's greatest concentration of significant historic structures and an emerging awareness of the role such structures are playing, not only as adaptively reused buildings where people live, work, shop, and enjoy recreation, but also as places that contribute to the unique character of downtown San Diego and to its irreplaceable sense of place. Breathtaking historic restorations abound in center city, and many more are under construction or on the drawing board. The region is particularly blessed with first-rate historic attractions, most of which are connected to one another by San Diego's public transit system.    Centre City Development Corporation (CCDC), downtown's redevelopment agency, embarked on a Downtown Community Plan Update in 1992 that helped build the framework for center city's participation in City of Villages. The findings of CCDCs ambitious public outreach effort will be familiar to mayors, city councils, and urban planners everywhere in the United States:    • Is the central business district to be the region's major employment center, while still maintaining its historic, mixed-use character? If so, is the city at risk by devoting too much land to housing?  • Are housing initiatives providing enough opportunity and encouragement to bring families downtown?  • What about nearby amenities and commercial services for residents so that auto trips can be reduced?  • What about schools, parks, parking, services for the poor and homeless, affordable housing, and the amenities and attractions that bring so many tourists and conventioneers (and their money) to San Diego?  • Does the city need more light rail downtown, a transit mall, a shuttle to major destinations, and does it have the right mix of transportation choices?  • Is center city as pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly as it ought to be?  • Is the private auto going to receive equal billing with public transit?    Largely missing from these discussions was conscious consideration for the historic context of San Diego as a contributor to downtown and transportation revitalization -- not only the buildings and sites themselves, but the very street grids and pedestrian scale that make downtown San Diego so well-suited to transit. Despite the lack of discussion, many of San Diego' s efforts ""on the ground"" are affirming the link between historic areas and transit-supportive development.    The rail right-of-way purchased for the San Diego Trolley downtown connects many of the city's architecturally significant buildings. Restoration of historic structures is contributing substantially to transit-supportive development. Many of the mixed-use development projects planned and underway in the center city are careful restorations, adhering to the Secretary of Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and generating federal income tax credits for their developers.    NORTH PARK NEIGHBORHOOD   San Diego's North Park neighborhood is located about four miles northeast of downtown, past the San Diego Zoo and Balboa Park. Racially and ethnically diverse, North Park is home to about 50,000 people, and its design reflects its past as a classic older, urban streetcar neighborhood. Of the 22 businesses in the centermost block of North Park's commercial district, 15 are owned by individuals of different nationalities. The neighborhood's median family income is about $10,000 below the citywide median.    North Park's distinctive and treasured architectural gems are located along or near the older commercial sections of University Avenue. The neighborhood also boasts a large and notable collection of single- and double-story homes typifying the design and construction methods of the American Arts and Crafts movement of the early 20th century. Throughout North Park there is a diverse collection of California Bungalow, Prairie School, and Period Revival homes built between 1918 and 1941.   Image: The exquisitely restored Louis Bank of Commerce Building graces 5th Avenue in the Gaslamp Quarter    In 1996, North Park became the first Main Street program in the city of San Diego. The National Trust for Historic Preservation's Main Street Center is a comprehensive self-help process for revitalizing historic and traditional commercial districts in communities of all sizes and economic conditions. In keeping with Main Street's Four-Point Approach, North Park Main Street has been promoting economic and community revitalization by concentrating on physical improvements, strengthening organizational capabilities, promoting its assets and advantages, and building up the economic vitality of the community.    North Park Main Street partnered with San Diego's planning agency to develop a comprehensive planning proposal entitled the North Park Transit Village Project. The key components of the plan are to restore and maintain North Park's historic transit and pedestrian environment, fully revitalize the University Avenue business district, improve public transit, calm traffic, and make University Avenue itself safe for pedestrians and bicyclists. North Park Main Street is also enthusiastically advocating for the restoration of the historic Park Boulevard streetcar route from downtown San Diego to North Park, serving important destinations like the San Diego Zoo and Balboa Park along the way. North Park Main Street has even entered into an understanding with the owners of three remaining San Diego Class 1 streetcars from 1912 to pave the way for their restoration and reuse on the Park Boulevard route, should it be reestablished. The streetcar route was in service from 1907 to 1949 when it gave way to buses.    But the linchpin for North Park's participation in City of Villages is improving University Avenue on the one-mile segment from Interstate 805 on the east to Park Boulevard on the west, North Park's main street and one of the area's most dysfunctional arterials. The corridor is unsafe, congested, boasts the region's highest transit ridership, and is a major barrier for pedestrians because of inadequate crosswalks and excessive vehicle speeds. Nevertheless, North Park's many neighborhood organizations have long envisioned University Avenue as a pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use corridor, the redesign of which is essential to neighborhood revitalization.    To date, North Park has received $56,000 from the SANDAG Walkable Communities program and $14,000 in Community Development Block Grant Funds to perform preliminary design for University Avenue. The California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) has provided $300,000 to further refine the planning and feasibility study for the conceptual plan.    North Parks vision defines transportation improvements as essential to the principal goal of City of Villages to provide more housing and job opportunities in existing neighborhoods. More homes and jobs will require zoning changes for higher density and mixed use redevelopment in the vicinity of the transit corridor, which in the case of North Park, is also the community's commercial district. More residents and more transit patrons should translate into more customers for Main Street businesses.    It has been said of San Diego that it is a place where everyone plans, and this is certainly true of North Park itself. The North Park Transit Village Project is designed to be consistent with SANDAG's Regional Transportation Plan, MTDB's TransitWorks, and San Diego's General Plan of which City of Villages is a part. There is a Greater North Park Planning Committee and a North Park Main Street Design Committee, which produced a paper in 2000 entitled  Destination North Park: Improving Transportation in North Park's University Avenue Corridor , to stimulate community conversation about comprehensive transportation investments to improve the University Avenue corridor.    North Park looks like older neighborhoods everywhere, underutilized and isolated by auto-dependent sprawl. Its old, intrinsic value as a walkable, mixed-use, mixed-income place is being reexamined, and the collection of woes that the auto age helped inflict upon North Park will be revisited in the process. University Avenue's conflicted personality as a main street-like commercial spine of an older neighborhood and a busy regional arterial will be one of the first items demanding analysis and healing.    THE BALLPARK DISTRICT   ""This project has always been more than a ballpark. We are creating a vibrant downtown neighborhood, and this agreement enables us to preserve some of the character of the area and incorporate it into the redevelopment of East Village in a way that is consistent with the history of this part of downtown."" LARRY LUCCHINO, FORMER PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SAN DIEGO PADRES    When San Diego voters approved a new ballpark for the Padres in 1998 in the East Village neighborhood near City Centre, a major controversy ensued over a variety of adverse impacts the ballpark and ancillary development plans would have on historic resources.   Working with San Diego's Save Our Heritage Organization (SOHO), the National Trust for Historic Preservation placed the Arts and Warehouse District on its 1999 List of America's Most Endangered Historic Places to draw national attention to the potential loss and isolation of historic resources and to encourage San Diego and the Padres to look at alternatives that would keep the ballpark in Centre City and also save historic buildings slated for demolition in the original plan.   Discussions led to an agreement in September 1999 to save virtually all of the structures identified by preservationists as significant. Bruce Coons, SOHO's president, calls the new plan the best alternative available for preserving historic resources -- a unique and practical solution to the challenge of urban preservation.   San Diego Trolley's Orange and Blue Line stops at the East Village ballpark site, and many San Diego Transit bus routes provide direct and secondary access to the area as well as to the adjacent and recently expanded Convention Center and the highly popular Gaslamp Quarter.   San Diego has no minimum parking requirements in Centre City except for residential uses, and maximum parking limitations have been established for non-residential uses to reduce the parking supply downtown over time as a means to encourage the use of transit and car pooling. Additional parking for the ballpark and subsequent, phased redevelopment of the 26-block Ballpark District area featuring hotels, offices, retail, and residential space will be limited to approximately 4,000 spaces.   San Diego is preparing to mitigate anticipated parking shortages for weekday afternoon and weekend evening games by providing incentives, like transit passes, to encourage transit use by Ballpark service employees. Shuttle service to parking outside Centre City and incentives for greater trolley use by patrons during events will also be adopted.   In addition, San Diego is committed to two parking management plans prior to the first ballpark event, one for downtown and the other for residential neighborhoods adjacent to the ballpark. Attention is also being given to making it easier for patrons to walk to ballpark events.    ""Development and the preservation of historic resources do not have to be mutually exclusive."" RICHARD MOE, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL TRUST FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION    Image: Transit-supported night life in downtown San Diego is a key feature of city revitalization.    Signs of success   It is too soon to judge the outcomes for San Diego's City of Villages initiative or the MTDB's Transit First strategy. However, the robustness of the San Diego transit system and the very fact that City of Villages is so urgently needed attest to the presence of crucial ingredients for success in downtown San Diego and its near-in neighborhoods.   The much-admired San Diego trolley system serves 30 million riders per year, complemented by a bus system that serves 55 million riders. It remains one of the most cost-efficient rail systems anywhere and is emulated by transportation planners worldwide.   San Diego's core remains a desirable place to live and work, although high rents and a housing shortage loom as serious challenges. Citizens have been active participants in the City of Villages process, attending more than 200 public meetings and workshops during the past five years to develop and refine the goals and objectives of the program. In May 2003, San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy announced seven finalists for the City of Villages pilot program, in which neighborhoods competed to receive financial and technical assistance toward development of transit-oriented development or redevelopment projects. Two of the finalists feature historic preservation or efforts to connect historic areas with newer developed areas. One of the finalists, the North Park Pilot Village, is featured on pages 34-35.     Lessons learned   •  When looking forward to accommodate growth, looking back helps too.  San Diego's past will play a critical role in its future and will continue to contribute to community revitalization and the success of public transit. Much of what San Diego wants for its future was present in its past: travel choices, density, mixed uses, walkability, attractive and accessible public places, interactive social and economic diversity, and efficient land use.   •  A transit agency need not be a landowner to be a serious partner in joint development around transit stations.  Because MTDB does not own substantial amounts of developable land at its stations, joint ventures with adjacent land owners have made sense for the agency's redevelopment of rail station areas since the 1970s. Success depends on supportive public policies and an understanding of the needs of private developers who are willing to participate. Small-scale joint developments have been worth pursuing because they generated revenues, provided visibility for the station, and tended to make station areas more attractive to riders. Agreements among local governments were made easier by the fact that MTDB board members are locally elected officials from its entire service area.

TRANSIT VILLAGES AND INTERMODAL CENTERS RECONNECT AND RESTORE COMMUNITIES   In their book  Transit Villages in the 21st Century  Michael Bernick and Robert Cervero call the San Francisco Bay Area ""arguably the epicenter of America's budding transit village movement, with a constituency of public officials, developers, and planners, along with several of the most visible 'new urbanist' architects and designers united in the cause of creating a new type of community and built form."" Although the Bay Area is widely known for its livability, coordination of land use and transportation planning, and the historic streetcar system in downtown San Francisco, the region has suffered its share of growing pains and serious missteps along the way to restoring a regional framework for transit.   The San Francisco Bay Area is served by four major rail systems: the San Francisco Municipal system (Muni), the CalTrain commuter system, Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), and the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). Muni operates San Francisco's beloved trolleys, many of which are historic and run along routes that are rich in historic resources. CalTrain carries 30,000 passengers a day from San Jose to San Francisco up the west side of the Bay through San Mateo County. VTA is a 10-year-old light rail system that serves Santa Clara County, primarily downtown San Jose, until the system is further expanded. BART is the 500-pound gorilla of the five-county Bay Area, a 30-year-old heavy rail system that will connect all five counties ringing San Francisco within the next decade.   BART's first 20 years yielded few success stories for transit-oriented development. Transportation engineers conducted planning and station site design with little consideration to land use or community character. Dan Solomon, a San Francisco architect and co-founder of the Congress for a New Urbanism, has called the typical BART station ""Fort BART, a killer of downtowns"" because the standard design surrounds a station with a surface parking lot and other features that physically disconnect stations from the communities they are supposed to serve. BART ""tore the heart out of the historic downtowns of many Bay Area cities,"" according to Solomon.   Over the past decade, BART has become more responsive to local planning, historic resources, and development issues. The system's officials now realize that cooperation with local government and community residents can boost ridership and improve the value of BART-owned property. In communities such as the Town of Hayward in Alameda County and the Fruitvale district of Oakland, BART is now helping correct the mistakes its planners made in the past. In San Jose, BART is working with local officials to enhance an already-vibrant downtown. Next to the San Jose downtown, the city and regional transportation officials are collaborating to create a world-class intermodal transportation center in a historic railroad depot, with a variety of nearby housing and employment choices in renovated historic structures and new infill developments.   According to Rod Diridon, a transportation expert who now chairs the Board of the California High Speed Rail Authority, ""Throughout the world, rail stations focus growth. This is particularly important in California, where the population is expected to double to 60 million by 2040. The state's investment in urban stations is paying high dividends in the preservation of settled neighborhoods and historic buildings. We are protecting the best of the past to create a better future.""    Image: The Diridon Station, located in the renovated 1935 Southern Pacific train depot, is an anchor for redevelopment in San Jose.    SAN JOSE DOWNTOWN   ""Light rail was the critical element in recreating a 'there, there' in San Jose's downtown. The system was the catalyst in bringing back that historic place,"" according to Robert Cervero. Dan Solomon calls downtown San Jose ""the single best example in the Bay Area of successful transit-oriented development.""   ""In reality, all downtown development in San Jose is transit-oriented development,"" says Dennis Korabiak, redevelopment program manager for the San Jose Redevelopment Agency. Notwithstanding the well-known deflation of the dot.com balloon and the substantial job and sales tax hits taken by Santa Clara County over the past two years, the Silicon Valley and its capital, San Jose, are alive and kicking. Transit, in all of its modes, may be the single most important reason.""    Image: Within the next decade, the Diridon Station will serve light rail, BART, and high-speed rail.    Following the classic downtown doldrums of the 1960s, caused by the usual culprits, Santa Clara County voters appeared to understand that transit is a necessary part of economic revival. On four separate occasions over the last 25 years, county voters have approved half-cent sales tax increases to fund transportation projects, most of them rail transit. The first increase in 1976 was approved by more than the requisite majority vote, and now brings in more than $130,000,000 per year.   In 1986 the first light rail line, the Guadalupe line, was completed by the Santa Clara County Transportation Agency (in 1995 the name was changed to the Valley Transportation Authority, or VTA). Although BART has still not made it to San Jose, the area is well served by a combination of bus, light rail, CalTrain commuter service to San Francisco, and other lines to such cities as Sacramento and Stockton.   In the ongoing efforts to create a new ""there, there"" in the historic downtown and other target neighborhoods, VTA has worked exceptionally closely with the political power structure, the San Jose Planning Department and Redevelopment Agency, and major landowners such as the San Jose Water Company. All agree on the need for high-density housing downtown, despite the economic downturn, and on transit-oriented development as an important tool for a vibrant downtown. In downtown San Jose the strategy has been paying off in a number of ways, including the preservation of historic structures such as the Jose Theater, built in 1906, where Harry Houdini performed and Charlie Chaplin is said to have made a personal appearance. The Jose went from mainstream movies to Spanish-language films as the population shifted, and then went dark. Although on the National Register, it was slated for demolition as part of a larger redevelopment project. At the prodding of the local Preservation Action Council, the Redevelopment Agency worked with the private developer (Jim Fox, the head of Saratoga Capital) to save the building, which required seismic retrofit, and retain it for the performing arts.   A larger project, New Century Commons, is an 1896 building that includes 26 rental apartments on two stories and a ground-floor retail space currently leased by Zanotto's, a grocery store. The building connects to the larger Century Center Apartments project, which consists of 89 rental units and 16,000 square feet of retail. The San Jose Redevelopment Agency contributed nearly half of the $25 million cost of the housing component.   The De Anza Hotel, another National Register building was rehabilitated by Jim Fox with $10.5 million in private investment, supplemented by substantial assistance from the city and historic tax credits that the developer calls ""indispensable."" The project was completed in 1989, with a 14-month construction period, following an extremely short 6-month approval process by the Landmarks Commission and City Council.   Other historic residential rehabs include the Twohy Building, a local landmark that now houses residential lofts above ground-floor retail; the three-story Security Building, built in 1890 and seismically retrofitted in 1996 by Barry Swenson Builders, with offices above ground-floor retail; and the Leticia Building, a historic renovation project with fully tenanted offices. Because of light rail access, the city required no parking for this and other similar projects.    SAN JOSE DIRIDON STATION   The Diridon Station, the anchor of a development area for which San Jose city leaders have high hopes, started life in 1935 as the Southern Pacific Train Depot. In relative disrepair, the station was sold by Southern Pacific to the state transportation and public works agency, CalTrans, in 1980, then sold again in 1990 to the regional Joint Powers Board, made up of representatives from Santa Clara, San Mateo, and San Francisco Counties. During the 1990s it was rehabilitated with funding from CalTrans and VTA, and the parking lot was expanded. Placed on the National Register in 1993, the building was renovated in 1995. Upon completion, it was renamed Diridon Station, after Rod Diridon, a long-time member of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, one of the Bay Area's -- indeed the nation's --  foremost transportation experts. The station named for him can truly be said to be a model intermodal transportation terminal. Diridon Station is a hub for a dizzying array of services:   • the CalTrain San Jose/San Francisco commuter rail line;  • the Altamont Commuter Express, with daily trips between San Jose and Stockton;  • the Capitol Service intercity line run by Amtrak between San Jose and Sacramento;  • the Highway 17 Express feeder bus service to Santa Cruz, run by VTA and Amtrak; and  • the light rail Guadalupe line in downtown San Jose, run by the VTA.    Image: The historic Hyatt Sainte Claire Hotel faces out on San Jose's light rail line, along San Carlos Street.   Within the next decade, Diridon Station will also serve the following line expansions:   • the light rail expansion, currently under construction by VTA, which will connect to the Guadalupe line and extend to the City of Campbell (Southwest of San Jose), with completion scheduled for 2006;  • a long-discussed extension of the BART line from its current terminus in Fremont in the East Bay, through a tunnel under downtown San Jose, to Diridon Station. The line is in early design stage, with hoped-for completion in 2012; and  • High-speed rail from Los Angeles, projected for completion in 2012.   Jim Lightbody, deputy director for Transit Planning and Development at VTA, says, ""It is critical that VTA and the city have worked jointly to ensure that the area around the Diridon Station receives the right kind of development to reinforce the substantial public investment in transit.""   The present and planned transit use of the Diridon Station, together with the nearby multi-use arena, has sparked a substantial planning effort by the City of San Jose, several mixed-use private developments, and a rezoning proposal by the largest land-owner in the sector, the San Jose Water Company.   With the assistance of the San Jose Redevelopment Agency, VTA recently completed the final draft of a strategic plan to guide the long-term development of the Diridon station area. The plan covers more than 64 acres, representing 4 million square feet of commercial space and 2 million square feet of residential space in 1,800 housing units. The plan considers and coordinates a number of recent and current planning efforts, including the San Jose 2020 General Plan, the Midtown Specific Plan, Strategy 2000: Greater Downtown Strategy for Development, the Guadalupe River Park Master Plan, and the Delmas Park Neighborhood Improvement Plan. The station area's future would be guided by two major factors. First, the extensive transportation investments in downtown San Jose could make the city ""the most important transit hub in the Bay Area."" Second, demand for commercial office and high-density residential space remains strong in downtown San Jose, despite the economic downturn. The continued intensification of uses in the downtown area ""provides the opportunity to reinforce the attractiveness of this urban center as a place to work and live,"" according to Strategy 2000. In particular, the plan states that the Diridon Station area ""will be the most direct expansion zone for downtown and will enjoy high accessibility to a wide range of transit and the intermodal transit center [and] is therefore suited to the highest-density commercial office/mixed use development pattern, with a strong emphasis on lively pedestrian activity, entertainment uses, and a vibrant mix of local and national retail.""   The plan specifies architectural excellence and historic preservation as part of a successful planning strategy, directing the community to ""create an icon of Silicon Valley, with landmark architecture, retail and entertainment facilities, and civic and cultural space ... [and] enhance the existing urban and natural setting with reasonably scaled, environmentally responsible, pedestrian-oriented urbanism.""   These are lofty goals, but already supported by the evident interest of private developers, as well as initial successes in the station area. Immediately across the tracks to the west of the station, the Castle Company has begun preliminary site work and toxic clean-up on the southern portion of a two-block high-density residential project that will feature 150 new condominium units. The second phase of the project includes the historic brick Del Monte cannery, which will be rehabilitated into 200 high-end condominiums.   Two blocks east of the Diridon Station, across the street from the arena, is an eight-acre parcel owned by the SJW Land Company, the real estate subsidiary of the San Jose Water Company. The land has been owned by the company for 50 years and is the site of their headquarters building, a 20,000-square-foot, two-story Spanish-style building on the National Register that will be incorporated into the company's proposed new development. The company has requested a zoning change to permit redevelopment of the parcel to include 350,000 square feet (364 units) of residential; 1,000,000 square feet of commercial; and up to 50,000 square feet of retail. The company hasn't decided whether to enter into a joint venture, develop the project alone, or pursue some other financing structure. Janelle McCombs, director of real estate for SJW, says the time is now ripe to seek approval for an ambitious planned development for the property: ""We see this as a long-term strategic play. We are extremely optimistic about the future of the Diridon Station area. The station is clearly a major transportation hub that enhances our project, which in turn enhances the transportation hub.""    FRUITVALE DISTRICT, OAKLAND   The Fruitvale district is the principal Latino community of the City of Oakland. Until the 1960s, the major shopping street in the community was East 14th Street, which was so popular it was known as ""the second downtown of Oakland."" The construction of huge regional shopping malls and discount centers undermined East 14th so much that by the 1990s, the street's retail vacancy rate had risen to 50 percent. Street crime, drug traffic, and disinvestment increased. A major job provider, the Del Monte Cannery, closed its doors.   Although the introduction of BART service to Fruitvale in the 1970s had greatly improved transit access to the area -- the station is the destination for nine bus lines traveling along East 14th Street, now known as International Boulevard -- BART's introduction also siphoned stable residents away to the far East Bay suburbs, where housing was cheaper. BART razed homes and stores to make way for the Fruitvale station, which was situated to literally turn its back on the community. The area around the station was lifeless. Passengers hurried to their cars and sped away.   Enter the Unity Council (formerly known as the Spanish-Speaking Unity Council), led by Arabella Martinez and Manuela Silva. The Council created the Fruitvale Development Corporation and Fruitvale Main Street program in the early 1990s to craft a remarkable turnaround for the neighborhood. Their efforts were so impressive, their early achievements so dramatic, their persuasive abilities and creative financing moves so stunning, that a new term should be coined to describe their approach: perhaps community instigation, rather than just involvement.   In 1992 the City of Oakland changed the name of historic East 14th Street to International Boulevard. The Unity Council worked with newly-elected City Councilman Ignacio de la Fuente to obtain $185,000 in Community Development Block Grant funds for an ambitious program of store façade improvements, park and playground upgrading, graffiti removal, street lighting, and tree planting. The Council also used the funds to establish a neighborhood watch program that hectored and hassled drug dealers and adult bookstore and strip club operators until they folded their tents.   The Council also undertook efforts to rehabilitate older buildings and bring in private investors. The Council purchased the historic Masonic Temple for renovation and use as a community center. In 1993, the Council and Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris invited Transportation Secretary Federico Peña to Fruitvale. Peña arrived with a check for $470,000 to continue the International Boulevard renovation and to provide initial pre-development funding for the Fruitvale Transit Village.    FRUITVALE TRANSIT VILLAGE   When Martinez and Silva first conceived of a development project to bring back International Boulevard, they did not intend it to be transit-oriented. They simply wanted to develop a mixed-use project that would include multifamily housing for mixed income levels. The Unity Council did not envision a direct link to transit until BART unwittingly presented a golden opportunity in the form of a proposed 500-car parking garage in 1991.   The garage was to be sited in such a way as to further separate the BART station from the Fruitvale community and International Boulevard (then still known as East 14th Street). Although BART held initial public hearings as required under the environmental impact assessment process, local citizens were not really made aware of the problems the garage posed to the community. Martinez and Silva realized the danger and marshaled strong community objections at the final public hearings. Citizens did not oppose the parking garage itself, but rather the lack of focus on the Fruitvale community and its goals. The project was stalled until a better solution could be found.   BART, including members of the BART board and staff members such as Jeff Ordway and his colleagues in the BART Property Development Office, responded positively to the community's concerns. In the meantime, the Council took some steps to establish momentum for a completely fresh approach to the main commercial corridor.   The Fruitvale Development Corporation (FDC) owned nearby property it had earlier purchased from the Union Pacific Railway. BART agreed to take this property for its garage, in exchange for which FDC would take out a 95-year lease on the original BART site, on which to build the mixed-use Fruitvale Transit Village to provide a strong physical link to International Boulevard.   Phase I of the project consists of some 255,000 square feet and will cost approximately $65,000,000. The design, by architect Ernesto Vasquez, features 47 units of housing above 38,000 square feet of retail shops, restaurants, and a traditional mercado, or market plaza. Community resources will total 63,000 square feet and will include the headquarters of the Unity Council, the Cesar Chavez Public Library, childcare and senior centers, and a public plaza in front of the station, with a tree-lined pedestrian walkway to International Boulevard. Importantly, the project will also include La Clinica de la Raza Medical Center, a 47,000-square-foot outpatient and preventive care facility serving 15,000 families.   The financing of the Fruitvale Transit Village is an extraordinary blending of 501(c)(3) bond debt, enhanced by Citibank ($20,000,000) and grants from every governmental and foundation source imaginable, both local and national, from the Levi Strauss Foundation to the Ford Foundation, from a local library bond issue to grants from at least five federal agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department of Transportation, EPA, the Federal Transit Administration, and even the Federal Emergency Management Administration.   In addition to the first phase of the Transit Village, the project team used $6,500,000 in HUD grants and city loans to develop an adjacent senior citizen housing project. This second phase of the Village, currently in the planning stage, is to include 200 units of housing and 30,000 square feet of commercial uses.   Image: The proposed Fruitvale Transit Village features a traditional mercado, or market plaza, and new retail, restaurants, and housing, all easily accessible to transit.    CITY OF HAYWARD   Hayward is located in Alameda County in the East Bay. As with thousands of small cities across the country, Hayward's once-vigorous downtown was dealt a mortal blow in mid-century, principally by the advent of several large shopping malls and discount warehouses nearby. Jesus Armas, city manager for Hayward, says, ""The 1960s and 1970s saw a gradual and consistent decline in our downtown, aided and abetted by Proposition 13,"" the statewide ballot measure that passed in 1978, severely restricting property tax revenues.   The area between the BART station and downtown Hayward was declared a redevelopment area in 1985. With no tax increment financing in view yet, city officials had to choose their renewal efforts very carefully. Should redevelopment be focused on the old major shopping street, Foothill Boulevard, or around the BART station, three blocks to the west? Although the station was surrounded by surface parking lots, an auto dealership, and other low-level industrial uses, access to BART was strengthened by the inclusion of Alameda County Transit buses and a nearby Greyhound terminal. The city chose the station area, bought a large private parcel which they leased to BART for additional parking, and hired architect Dan Solomon to do a ""recentering"" plan to connect the station to the historic downtown. Solomon proposed tying the two sectors together with multifamily housing, retail uses, and a civic plaza. Although the city was not financially able to take serious steps to implement the plan, the seeds for revitalization were planted.   After Armas became city manager in 1993, the Hayward Redevelopment Agency sold land at a written-down value to a private developer for construction of 83 town houses. The project represented an effort by the city to follow some elements of the recentering plan as well as to partially subsidize needed higher-density housing.    HAYWARD CITY HALL   BART's newly established property development office, led by Jeff Ordway, enabled the City of Hayward and BART to work together to achieve transit-oriented development. Hayward and BART worked to reconfigure BART-owned and city-owned parcels to build a new City Hall in the heart of the project area. The project received $1,000,000 from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (a Bay Area regional body) to build a pedestrian walkway from City Hall to the BART station, consciously keeping a clear line of sight between the two.   Next, the two agencies jointly issued a Request for Proposals for private development, on a design-build basis, for the new City Hall and multifamily housing, on land occupied by parking and abandoned buildings. By then, BART had built a garage on the other side of the station and no longer required the surface parking lot.   After an attenuated selection process, the developer chosen by the city decided to build only the City Hall. The city then selected a developer for the residential portion who would only build for-sale units. BART balked at this, because basic policy is to lease its land long term, not sell it, so as to retain the opportunity to participate in increased property values over time. Although this policy is fiscally sound, it posed an obstacle to the for-sale housing opportunity.   Fortunately, Alameda County owned property nearby. The city bought this parcel and swapped it with BART for the land that had been the subject of the RFP. Patty Hirota-Cohen, senior real estate officer for BART, recalls, ""This was a first for us. BART had never done such a land swap before. The swap enabled the city and the private sector to come together to build a new City Hall, offices, and housing. It turned out to be a win/win situation.""   The city then sold the land for the development of City Walk, 77 town homes built by The Olson Company, a firm specializing in urban infill projects. The city did not have to write down the land cost because the transit-oriented planning and development added enough value to make the subsidy unnecessary.   Lessons learned   •  Think creatively about land ownership, leasing, and development arrangements.  Public entities have varying approaches to land acquisition, ownership, and development that can pose obstacles to effective TOD. The ""land swap"" between the City of Hayward and BART is an inspired example of how agencies can work hand in hand to make development arrangements work for all parties. Fruitvale Transit Village is being constructed on the former BART surface parking lot, an elegant reclamation of valuable land for higher and better uses near transit.   •  Let the public into the process.  BART would never have known how to change the agency's approach to station development without approaching the public first. Much of the credit for this turnaround belongs to groups like the Unity Council and city officials such as Hayward's Jose Armas and Fruitvale's de la Fuentes, who were prepared to bring to the table a local vision for their communities that could replace the original plans.   •  Make preservation an explicit, key element in TOD.  In San Jose, VTA has aggressively pursued partnerships with political leaders, city planners, major public and private land-owners, and private developers to create a joint approach to guiding growth in the San Jose region that specifically recognizes the importance of existing historic buildings in downtown and nearby neighborhoods. The city's recently drafted redevelopment plan specifies architectural excellence and historic preservation as part of a successful planning strategy. In Fruitvale, the Unity Council's director Arabella Martinez says, ""in both the ongoing renovation of International Boulevard and the planned uses for our project, we pick up elements of our existing neighborhood. We are most concerned that we integrate the new with the old and respect the community fabric.""    Signs of success   The city agencies and nonprofit groups who have encouraged or undertaken transit-oriented development in San Jose, Fruitvale, and Hayward have provided the catalyst for private development of residential, retail, and office space in all these communities. The housing and civic improvements in Hayward have enabled the city to strike a profitable deal with the Albertson's grocery store chain to sell a parcel across from City Hall for a large, new supermarket and have led to the private redevelopment of 200 rental units across the BART tracks. According to Jesus Armas, ""The real success here is the merging of two elements of the public sector with the private sector. Although other cities talk about TOD, we've actually done it.""   The Fruitvale commercial district has experienced a dramatic transformation over the past 10 years, with storefront vacancies dropping from 40 percent to 1 percent during that time. Working with the National Main Street Center, the Unity Council has effected facelifts for more than 100 commercial properties in the area. In 2003, more than 50 business owners along International Boulevard voted to form a Business Improvement District to use 100 percent of the city fees collected from them for self-determined improvements to streets and services. The Transit Village is expected to attract an additional 11,000 transit riders to the Fruitvale station, already the ninth busiest in BART's 43-station system, and will reduce traffic and pollution in the station area. The Transit Village is expected to create up to 1,000 new jobs for the area.   San Jose's TOD redevelopments have successfully bucked the national trend toward significant vacancies in the upper floors of street-level retail properties. Typically, even in strong downtowns across the country, upper floors above retail have high vacancy rates. The San Jose projects have consistently tenanted the upper floors, particularly with high-density residential uses. Retail remains the weakest use, largely because of the existence of eight large regional shopping malls within an eight-mile radius. Restaurants, however, are doing well in the downtown, as cultural and entertainment events in various venues are drawing people to the area.   Developers who are targeting San Jose's redeveloped historic Diridon Station cite the station as a major draw. The Castle Company, which has made a niche for itself in developing medium-to-high density residential projects near transportation hubs, believes such projects are less vulnerable to economic downturns because they respond to a pent-up demand for housing near transit stations and downtown jobs.   One block west of the historic San Jose cannery project is the 250 unit Cahill, a rental housing project completed in August 2002 and fully rented within five months in a soft market. David Lynn is development director for the project's sponsor, Avalon Bay, a Real Estate Investment Trust that has built some 44,000 rental units nationally. According to Lynn, ""We look at potential development sites for a variety of reasons. We are particularly seeking what we term 'supply-constrained' features. Transit stations are such features, particularly in the Bay Area, which is one of the most severely congested regions in the nation ...  and getting worse. A transit station nearby differentiates our sites. The Cahill site is one of our favorites, because the neighborhood is especially interesting for our residents, who have active lifestyles. They are highly educated and work in high value-added jobs. There are good restaurants in the area. The arena, an excellent entertainment venue, is nearby, and the Alameda is an eclectic street. And adjacency to the Diridon Station is a key element.""

Just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., the county is home to 190,000 people and more than 200,000 jobs. Arlington's neighborhoods have exemplified transit-oriented development since the turn of the 20th century. Transit investment spurred the initial development along Wilson Boulevard in the late 1890s, and transit investment was the crown jewel of the corridor's revitalization in the late 20th century.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   In the late 1890s, private developers created three 'commuter villages' -- Clarendon, Virginia Square, and Ballston -- along the new trolley lines serving Arlington County. Housing styles in these neighborhoods included four-squares, bungalows and Federal-revival residences. Young families attracted to these areas infused their neighborhoods with a spirit of civic enterprise that persists today in resident associations, park committees, and neighborhood activities.   In the 1930s and 1940s, thousands of new homes and garden-style apartments were built in Arlington to accommodate the federal government's expansion during the New Deal and World War II. One of the most prominent of the garden-apartment communities is Colonial Village, completed in 1940 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.   By the early 1950s, the Clarendon-Virginia Square-Ballston area was a regional center for shopping, offices, and residences. The construction of the Capital Beltway in the 1960s pushed development away from Washington, and eroded Arlington's retail and office base.   Arlington revisited its land use planning and transit investment simultaneously in the 1970s, when the development of a master plan for Arlington County coincided with planning for the region's new Metrorail system. Close coordination of land use and transit planning during this crucial era enabled the county to direct major rail investment into the Wilson Boulevard corridor and build on existing street patterns that are conducive to transit use. The opening of the Orange Line in 1979 launched an unprecedented era of growth in Arlington County, guided by a transit-oriented General Land-Use Plan.    LAND USE AND TRANSIT   In the 1970s, extensive study and citizen participation led Arlington to ask the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (WMATA) to reroute the proposed Orange Line from the median of Route 66 to the Wilson Boulevard/Fairfax Drive corridor. This action shifted development from the automobile-intensive Route 66 corridor, where park-and-ride facilities would have been required to serve the new Metro stations, to the historically transit-oriented Wilson Boulevard. This decision protected the property values and traditional character of neighborhoods in both areas by reducing auto traffic on nearby residential streets.   After finalizing the decision about the new rail route, Arlington County initiated its land use plan and developed flexible planning guidelines that gave clear instructions and incentives to developers of transit-oriented projects. The development community has taken full advantage of these guidelines, with confidence that their designs would be approved or easily amended to address county concerns.   WMATA now operates two Metrorail lines, the Blue and Orange, that serve Arlington County and connect the county to downtown Washington, D.C. and outlying suburbs. The Blue Line provides service to Ronald Reagan National Airport as well as the mixed-use developments of Pentagon City and Crystal City. The Orange Line serves the developing Rosslyn-Ballston corridor and Arlington's many residential communities. Five stations on the Orange Line have been the focus of intensive development: Rosslyn; Courthouse (with large-scale multiple-use developments for housing, retail, entertainment, government functions, and office space); Clarendon (an eclectic, mostly residential area with a bustling commercial core); Virginia Square, (site of a satellite campus for the state-run George Mason University); and Ballston (a residential/office/retail area anchored by a major shopping mall).   Metrobus and local bus services support rail service. Arlington County has limited parking at Metrorail stations through land-use policies that make walking easy and promote pedestrian access to Metrorail stations.    Image: Historic garden-style apartments provide affordable housing throughout Arlington County.   ""Arlington has a long history of civic involvement in setting public policy. Much of our prosperity and growth is directly attributable to the grassroots participation of citizens who have cared about Arlington's future.""   CHRISTOPHER ZIMMERMAN  2002 CHAIRMAN OF THE ARLINGTON COUNTY BOARD     COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT   Arlington County's numerous citizen commissions have helped to engage, educate, and support a strong cadre of well-informed residents who understand the intricacies of land use and transit policies, and who have bought into a long-term course of action for their community. The county has come to be known regionally for ""the Arlington Way"" of successfully involving thousands of citizens directly in government decision making.   The Arlington County Planning Commission, established in 1956, is the chief citizen advisory group that advises the five-member Arlington County Board on land use matters. Members of the County Board are elected to terms long enough to permit them to learn about the issues at stake and take controversial stances. The county government has a high-caliber staff and low staff turnover to support the Board's decisions. Elected officials work hard to capture citizens' expertise in the planning process through appointments to numerous commissions, committees, and boards addressing neighborhood preservation and economic development.   In 1998 the Arlington County Planning Division created the Office of Neighborhood Services to emphasize the county's commitment to neighborhood services and to consolidate existing neighborhood preservation and improvement programs within one unit. The Office of Neighborhood Services consists of three service areas: neighborhood planning and service delivery, historic preservation, and capital improvement planning and development. The goals of the office include the following:   • Better communication between residents and county government;  • Increased county responsiveness to neighborhood needs and trends;  • More effective coordination among county departments on neighborhood services;  • Active citizen participation and civic awareness; and  • Effective neighborhood service delivery tailored to the needs of individual neighborhoods.    PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS   Arlington has formed public-private partnerships in Metrorail station areas to bring residents, developers, and business interests together to discuss and resolve issues and to sponsor activities such as jazz festivals and an array of community events. Key partners include the Ballston-Virginia Square Partnership, the Clarendon Alliance, the Rosslyn Renaissance, and the Columbia Pike Revitalization Organization.   WMATA has played a significant role in the redevelopment of the rail corridor through the transit agency's Joint Development Program, particularly around the Ballston station, where WMATA controls just under 2 acres of land, enough for a sizeable redevelopment project. The Ballston station project is comprised of 200,000 square feet of office space, 277 residential units, 26,000 square feet of retail, plus a hotel, all at an estimated value of $135 million. WMATA owns a 99-year lease on the project and receives $450,000 in annual lease revenue, plus 8 percent of tenants' and developers' adjusted gross income. WMATA also realized profit from the sale of about 15,000 square feet of the parcel for residential development.   The county's Neighborhood Conservation Program (NCP), established in 1964, has financed neighborhood groups in self planned improvements to schools, playgrounds, street lighting, traffic controls, and sidewalks in 40 of Arlington's traditional neighborhoods. In 1999, when the program celebrated its 35th anniversary, Arlington residents voted $3.8 million in Community Conservation Bond funds for the NCP.   Neighborhood conservation and the partnerships exemplify the importance Arlington places on the ""public-private collaboration [that] helps create a modern 'urban village' concept that seeks to preserve historical essence while providing up-to-date amenities,"" according to recent information from Arlington County.   Image: Arlington's modern ""urban village"" concept preserves the sense of the historic community while permitting up-to-date development    Signs of success   Arlington County residents enjoy the lowest tax rate in the Washington metropolitan region, with considerable help from the development in the Metrorail corridors. Using only 6 percent of the land in the county, the rail corridors produce almost half of the total tax revenues for the county. The local tax base has increased from $5.3 billion to $27.2 billion since 1980, the year after the Orange Line opened, and the value of homes has also increased.   Office space along Wilson Boulevard has more than doubled since 1980, and 53 percent of all the county's office space is located in the corridor. The two Metrorail corridors along the Blue and Orange Lines account for 67 percent of all jobs in Arlington County. The addition of over 15,000 residential units in the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor alone since 1980 represents 19 percent of the county's population and 23 percent of the total housing units. Almost 1 million square feet of retail space has followed the residential and office development, transforming Ballston from a declining area in neglect to a vibrant locale. The five stations in Arlington County account for 6 percent of Metrorail's weekday ridership throughout the entire Washington, D.C. region. Use of these stations has increased 41 percent since 1980.   Interest in preserving Arlington's historic resources was rare in the 1970s. Today, the effort is widespread, involving the county's Historical Affairs and Landmark Review Board, the Arlington Historical Society, the Arlington Heritage Alliance, and the Neighborhood Conservation Program. As of 2001, the County Board had designated 28 local historic districts.    Lessons learned   •  Engage citizens and business people in long-term planning and development.  Today's informed resident or business owner could be tomorrow's planning commissioner, council member, or even mayor. Support ad hoc mechanisms (focus groups, charettes, and so on) with standing citizen committees, permanent community liaisons at planning commissions, or routine training for citizens and elected officials.    •  Make planning guidelines flexible and realistic, and include incentives for high-density development.  Arlington has demonstrated that the integration of land use and transportation planning need not be overly prescriptive or constraining. The development community has taken advantage of flexible planning guidelines and incentives for greater densities because they are confident that their projects are viable both economically and according to planning guidelines. The result is significant regional growth in a compact, older area of the region.    •  Define and protect your community's particular strengths.

Taking its name from a Native American word for ""strong,"" the city was already a center for river and railroad transportation before the Great Chicago Fire threatened to undo all its progress in a single night. In a characteristic burst of energy and vision, Chicagoans used the fire's devastation as a jumping-off point for revising and rebuilding the city, ushering in its Golden Age, as symbolized by the 1893 World's Columbia Exposition and the establishment of a rich and diverse architectural heritage, embodied in the city's 1909 master plan by architect Daniel Burnham.   Today the city is once again enjoying a remarkable comeback. Under the leadership of Mayor Richard M. Daley, Chicago has stemmed the population losses caused by earlier middle-class flight and urban disinvestment. Through the rehabilitation of older neighborhood assets and significant new construction, the city is attracting residents and revenues. Chicago's population, now approaching 3 million people, grew 4 percent during the 1990s.   Chicago's recent rehabilitation of the Green Line rail route and stations has dovetailed with the revitalization of several communities along the Green Line, including the predominantly African American community of West Garfield Park. The upgrade of the city's oldest elevated line and strategic relocation of the rail station have significantly complemented the longtime efforts of a private nonprofit group, Bethel New Life, to revitalize the area. More recently, the city has completely restored the historic Garfield Park Conservatory, within walking distance of the station. The renewed conservatory has attracted thousands of weekend transit users from all over the city and has made this community a focal point for cultural events and tourism. Through its work on the Green Line Conservatory Station and the Garfield Park Conservatory, Chicago has balanced and enhanced the interplay of history, civic character, ethnic diversity, and public transportation that make this great city so unique.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   West Garfield Park is located on Chicago's West Side, an area that historically was home to immigrants from Ireland, Italy, and Eastern Europe, and became predominantly African American during the past century. The area is served by the Lake Branch of the Green Line, built in 1892. At the center of West Garfield Park is one of the city's great open spaces, the 185-acre park that gives the neighborhood its name. The park's crown jewel is a 1908 conservatory that has been described as a work of ""landscape art under glass."" The Park Conservatory is within a half-mile of the Chicago Transit Agency (CTA) Conservatory Station. Until recently this area was overrun with drug traffic and crime, and attracted few outside visitors.   In the mid-1990s, CTA initiated a program to reconstruct and rehabilitate its oldest lines, starting with the Green Line in 1994. The $300 million project was funded with a combination of FTA rail modernization grants, matched by state and local funds. The restoration of the Green Line and the rebuilding of the Garfield Park Station helped to spur the rehabilitation of the conservatory. Both efforts have complemented existing initiatives to establish high-quality affordable housing and create jobs and cultural amenities in the area. Much of the revitalization activity is the work of Bethel New Life, a faith-based nonprofit group that has brought an estimated $110 million of new investment into this credit-starved community, creating more than 1,000 new units of affordable housing and securing 5,000 job placements in West Garfield Park since 1979.    GREENING THE GREEN LINE   Chicago's public transportation network is one of the world's most sophisticated, with railroads, transit, and bus routes reaching out in all directions to connect the city with its region. In addition, Chicago is the nerve center for passenger and freight rail in the United States.   CTA is the largest transit provider in the Chicago region. CTA's 11 rapid transit lines provide access throughout the city and in the surrounding suburban communities. Annual ridership on the rail lines exceeds 151 million trips. Ridership has increased steadily since 1998, helped by recent growth in population and employment.   Image: The rebirth of the Garfield Park Conservatory complemented the redevelopment of the Garfield Park Station on Chicago's Green Line elevated rail route.   Within this complex network, the three-branched, 25-station Green Line serves the West Side. Riding the Green Line from end to end demonstrates the diversity and contradictions of the city it serves: Its span connects industrial wastelands with genteel residential areas, breathtaking historic sites with brand-new construction, and open green spaces with busy urban streets. West Garfield Park and the conservatory at its heart combine many of these contradictions, and with them come both challenges and opportunities.   Image: The restored Garfield Park Conservatory, served by nearby transit, now attracts 15 times more visitors each year than in 1995.    Undertaken by the Chicago Park District, the restoration of the conservatory began in 1994, the same year that CTA began to reconstruct the West Garfield Park elevated train station. Although the station rehabilitation helped the Chicago Park District raise public and private resources, in typical Chicago fashion it also took a disaster to drive home the importance of preserving the conservatory. In the winter of 1994, a burst pipe froze and killed most of the rare and tropical plants housed inside the conservatory. ""That was the wake-up call,"" says Lisa Roberts, director of conservatories for the Chicago Park District. Faced with demolition or an $8 million restoration effort, the city bravely chose restoration. This former ""ghost town"" (with only 3,000 visitors in all of 1995), is once again a green oasis, attracting 15 times that many visitors in more recent years, and drawing a record-breaking 500,000 visitors to a recent show of glass works by artist Dale Chihuly.   Just as the Green Line rehabilitation enhanced the restoration of the West Garfield Park Conservatory, so has the conservatory's rebirth enhanced 20 years of housing and business redevelopment efforts in the area. The faith-based community development organization Bethel New Life, established in 1979, has implemented a holistic community revitalization plan that addresses housing, daycare and educational needs, traffic, neighborhood safety, recreation, and open spaces. Bethel New Life, which itself has been the engine of so much change in this challenging community, calls the redevelopment of the conservatory ""one of the major breakthroughs for this neighborhood."" Bethel New Life is building on the twin assets of a renewed historic park preserve and new train station to develop and implement plans for additional community reinvestment in West Garfield Park, including new homes in Parkside and three other areas, and a new commercial investment at the adjacent Green Line station at Lake and Pulaski with child care, community stores, and local jobs.

CTA relocated and retained the original historic station houses along the Green Line, supplementing them with new compatible construction that is ADA-compliant and modernized. During 2001, customers took one million more rides on the Green Line than in 1993, its last full year of service before it was closed for the rehabilitation. In fact, growth in ridership from 1990 to 2000 exceeded the growth in the region's population. Ridership on the Lake Branch alone, along which the Conservatory Station is located, has grown by more than 52 percent since 1993. Annual ridership was nearly 9.5 million in 2001.   The conservatory has become a center of community and commercial activity. The Garfield Park Conservatory Alliance, in partnership with public and private organizations, constructed an Urban Demonstration Garden at the conservatory in 2001 to teach gardening techniques specific to the challenges of urban spaces and to work with Westside community groups and residents to create, sustain, and improve neighborhood green spaces.   In May 2003 the Chicago Park District opened the Garfield Market, a green market that converts a historic building and rustic grounds at the conservatory into a European-style open-air bazaar offering unique green products from local merchants each weekend. The market also houses CityEscape Garden Center, a 10,000-square-foot privately operated landscaping store begun by a first-time local business owner, as well as 12 ""green-friendly"" shops. The Garfield Market adaptively reuses an old horse stable once used by the Chicago Park District.   ""A park should draw and attract visitors from around the city and those who live nearby,"" said Chicago Park District General Superintendent David Doig. ""At Garfield, exhibits such as  Chihuly: A Garden of Glass  and  Chocolate Festival  have made tremendous progress calling residents back to the historic hothouse, and now with the addition of The Green Market, selling products and foods, we hope visitors will extend their stay and neighbors will return to the Conservatory.""   The rehabilitation of the Green and Brown Lines, two of Chicago's elevated rail lines, has spurred reinvestment in the areas adjacent to the lines. Bethel New Life has built almost 40 new homes in the area since 1994, replacing derelict apartment buildings that had become drug dens.    Lessons learned   •  Look into the activities of nonprofit and faith-based groups in challenged neighborhoods.  Nonprofit housing developers are avatars of redevelopment in traditional and older neighborhoods. They are also natural partners in creating transit-supportive communities.   •  Never underestimate the power of a single historic landmark to be a flash point of community pride.  The restoration of the Garfield Park Conservatory created the opportunity for residents and visitors alike to see the surrounding neighborhood in a new light and consider it a Chicago destination in its own right.   •  Stay aware of major transit investments in the vicinity of historic resources.  In the case of the Garfield Park Conservatory, the rehabilitation and relocation of the Conservatory Station helped the Chicago Park District raise critical resources, both public and private, to save the site.       Back to top   Cleveland, Ohio   Reawakening a Historic Commercial District   SHAKER SQUARE SHOPPING CENTER   Cleveland Union Terminal has epitomized the concept of transit-oriented development in that city since the terminal's dedication in 1930. Now known as Tower City, the refurbished intermodal station in downtown Cleveland features a huge office and retail complex, the result of a public/private partnership led by the city's leading entrepreneurial family, the Ratners.   The original builders of Tower City were not interested in transit oriented development, as we know it today. Instead, M.J. and O.P. Van Sweringen -- two brothers affectionately known as ""the Vans"" -- were interested in development-oriented transit. Owners of several railroads and transit companies, the Vans initiated rail routes from downtown to the garden-city suburb they were developing in Shaker Heights, east of Cleveland.   Like Tower City, the retail center in Shaker Heights has been recently restored and upgraded. Conceived when trolleys and automobiles had just begun to share the streets, Shaker Square was designed to serve and enhance the surrounding neighborhood. The story of the creative public-private venture that brought new life to Shaker Square offers practical lessons for how communities can encourage local businesses, increase transit use, and reinvigorate residential areas while attracting visitors by transit.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   In 1905, the Van Sweringen brothers purchased property in a former Shaker community on the heights east of Cleveland. Inspired by the rural setting, and with a keen interest in city planning and design, the brothers envisioned one of the country's first ""garden-city"" suburbs with a mixture of handsome houses, apartments, shops, schools, and places of worship along tree-lined streets, interspersed with parks and lakes.   The brothers formed the Cleveland Interurban Railroad to bring streetcar lines and prospective homeowners from downtown Cleveland to the suburban homes they were building on lots east of the current location of Shaker Square. Dissatisfied with the streetcars' slowness and delays because of competing horse and automobile traffic, the Vans built a grade-separated trolley line to enhance service between Shaker Square and downtown. The ""rapid,"" as it was known, ran through Shaker Heights along the landscaped median of Shaker Boulevard, flanked by cartpaths for local travel. The line was eventually connected to the newly dedicated Cleveland Union Terminal in 1930.   Shaker Square, a retail center, opened in 1929. Located at the intersection of Shaker and Moreland Boulevards, the Square featured a trolley station and public green at the heart of a walkable network of shops, offices, and apartment buildings along landscaped boulevards, with streetscapes designed for walking. A limited number of curbside parking spaces fronted the stores, and larger lots were located behind the stores to accommodate foot traffic in the retail area.    In 1976, a half-century after its design was approved, Shaker Square and its surrounding apartment complexes were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. By that time, the once-vibrant shopping center was on the wane, and its many local owner-operated shops were struggling to keep up with newer, larger shopping centers in distant suburbs. Vacancies in Shaker Square were increasing and the center's physical plant was threatened with decline.    For Adam Fishman and Randy Ruttenberg, partners in a local development company, CenterPoint Properties, and residents of Shaker Heights, going to the Square had been a way of life. Sensitive to its history and role in the community, they began to formulate ideas for how to bring the Square back.   Image: The Shaker Square RTA Light Rail Station shuttles residents and visitors to this newly revitalized commercial district to enjoy unique shops, boutiques, restaurants, and entertainment venues.    SHAKING UP SHAKER SQUARE   Working with its development partner the Rosen Corporation, the development team of CenterPoint Properties sought a mix of tenancies that would not only meet the everyday needs of neighborhood residents, but would serve more discretionary demand and draw people from beyond the primary market area with unique shops, boutiques, restaurants, and entertainment venues.   An important consideration in selecting tenants was to match the pocketbooks of the community. The average household income within the Square's primary trade area is more than $94,000, and incomes in the Shaker Heights neighborhood to the east are even higher. The western portion of the Shaker Square neighborhood, which includes many of the apartment complexes, is also among Cleveland's highest-income communities, but averages a more moderate $32,000 per household. That population includes a high proportion of young professionals, with significant discretionary spending habits despite lower overall income. The developers planned to create a tenant mix that would appeal to the range of middle- and upper-income households within the shopping area. CenterPoint also wanted to carefully balance national, regional, and local stores: ""We didn't want just another center filled with the same national chains,"" says Fishman. Several of the existing tenants were seen as local institutions, and enjoyed strong local support. Fishman and Ruttenberg wanted to retain these and attract other local stores and restaurants. The developers set aside space for only a handful of recognized national retailers.   Fishman's vision for a tenant mix that included non-chain tenants was informed by the 1997 experience of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) in leasing space in Shaker Square's historic transit station. Maribeth Feke, GCRTA's director of planning, recalls the agency's enthusiasm over a proposal by McDonald's to replace the station's outgoing tenant, undertake $250,000 in renovations, and pay a high annual rent. Now, Feke admits the agency blundered: ""There was major opposition from the local community, and it made all the papers. There was even a group formed called MAM: Moms Against McDonald's."" Chastened, Feke reached out to the community. Although residents made it clear that a national fast-food chain was out of the question, they also suggested a hometown alternative: a diner.   A second RFP was issued, and Michael's Diner became the station tenant. The proprietor invested $150,000 toward rehabilitation and finishes. GCRTA contributed $35,000 from their station renovation fund for mechanical system and roofing upgrades. The diner opened in 1997.   Since then, GCRTA has completely revamped its approach to station area projects and leases. ""We now have a neighborhood representative at the table from the beginning,"" notes Feke, ""and we go to the community throughout the process. We learned a valuable lesson.""   Image: Trendy shops, such as the ones pictured, cater to the growing number of residents in the Shaker Square neighborhood.   ""We wanted a mixture of tenants that created synergy, making the Square an exciting and fun place.""  ADAM FISHMAN CENTERPOINT PROPERTIES    THE REMAKING OF SHAKER SQUARE   After about 18 months of negotiations and planning, CenterPoint launched an extensive community outreach effort. Reid Robbins, executive director of the Shaker Square Area Redevelopment Corporation (SHAD), a community development corporation that serves much of the surrounding community and focuses on the Square, reports that the developers ""attended a ton of meetings, worked really hard, and did really well."" Despite minor controversies over repositioning some tenants, Robbins recalls that CenterPoint's sensitivity to community and design issues, combined with strong support for saving the Square, assured that the proposals would be well received.   The project began in 2000, and was largely completed and leased within 12 months. Approximately 132,000 square feet of retail and 29,000 square feet of office area accommodates 56 different tenants. Initial anchor tenants included the upscale Wild Oats Market grocery store; Joseph Beth Booksellers, a regional bookstore and cafe; and Shaker Square Cinema, a refurbished historic movie house under a new, local owner. Other tenants include a variety of restaurants, from moderately priced to upscale; clothing stores; specialty stores offering housewares and kitchen accessories; stationary and gift shops; bakers and confectioners; art and photo galleries; hairdressers and spas; and a bank.   To accommodate the grocery store, three existing vendors were moved, their former store spaces combined, and the building footprint expanded. Parking was added to an enlarged rear lot. Aside from those alterations, the original Shaker Square structures were retained and restored. Extensive upgrades included awnings and a signage regime, all approved through the local historic review procedures. The streetscapes and public areas throughout the complex were also improved. To enhance pedestrian activity, outdoor cafe spaces were added at some restaurant locations, and the developers have also programmed outdoor events and occasional street performers on the public greens.    FINANCING   Total project costs were projected at $25.6 million. Fishman and Ruttenberg raised approximately $17.3 million from conventional debt and equity sources, leaving an $8.3 million gap. To make up the shortfall, CenterPoint cobbled together a wideranging public-private partnership involving state, county, and local officials and community development organizations.   A particularly interesting aspect of the gap financing was the role of tax increment financing (TIF). Although Shaker Square is located entirely within Cleveland's city limits, 80 percent of the area's property falls within the Shaker Heights School District. The developers had to secure approval for a TIF bond from both Shaker Heights and Cleveland. After a number of presentations, the developers were able to convince both jurisdictions that the investment in revitalizing Shaker Square would be in their interest. Without it, the property was likely to continue to lose value and tax revenues decline. With the TIF, values and tax revenues were certain to rise.   Shaker Heights agreed to forgo taxes on 75 percent of increased value for a period of 25 years. The jurisdiction would collect increased revenues against the remaining 25 percent. Cleveland agreed to forgo 100 percent of increases in non-school tax revenues for a period of 30 years.   Bond purchasers also had to be assured not only that the tax base would be adequately expanded to produce revenues to pay off the bonds, but that the project would have the resources to make the service payments in lieu of taxes to the bond fund as well. This combination proved difficult. In an unprecedented move for a private project, the Cuyahoga County Commissioners stepped in with a pledge to support the bonds. With the enhanced credit provided by that pledge, Cleveland Tomorrow, a community boosting subsidiary of the Cleveland Development Bank, and Neighborhood Progress, Inc., a community investment subsidiary of Village Capitol Corporation, purchased the bonds.

Building exteriors have been restored and interiors rehabilitated, streetscapes upgraded and enlivened with cafes and awnings, and the public green space improved. The area is alive with activity throughout the day and into the evening. The $4.1 million tax base prior to renovation grew into $18.5 million in just two years.   When the project started, 31 percent of the space at the center was vacant. Within a year, the project was able to attract new and replacement tenants, reaching virtual full occupancy. CenterPoint met its initial base rent projections and is realizing additional percentage rents from a number of tenants, a clear sign of good sales. Before renovation and repositioning, average rents at the Square were between $7 and $9 per square foot. Rents now average between $17 and $24, triple net. Net operating income produced from the center has quadrupled.   One anchor tenant, Wild Oats Market, closed in 2003, accounting for approximately 20 percent of the retail area in the complex. The Boulder-based company cited corporate problems and restructuring that resulted in the closing of a number of locations across the nation. CenterPoint was in active discussion with replacement grocers as this report went to press.   Transit use has been depressed throughout Cleveland since the national economic downturn. Boardings at the Shaker Square station are no exception. GCRTA's Feke believes that the numbers for Shaker Square might have been worse without the renovation. The transit agency's anecdotal evidence suggests that the project has generated new trips to see the reborn facility: ""I have talked with many people who have a renewed interest in taking the train to Shaker Square,"" says Feke. ""It is being seen as a destination by folks who had not gone there before and by those who had been there but not for a long time because the area had lost its luster.""   Robbins agrees: ""We are getting people from downtown and westside urban types riding out for a nice evening at the restaurants and shops. Before, there was none of that.""   Image: The land use and urban design concept of Shaker Square has proven to have enduring merit.    Lessons learned   •  Notice and respect what has withstood the test of time.  The land use and urban design concept of Shaker Square has proven to have enduring merit. The transit station is integrated into a shopping and service complex at the center of a moderate- to high-density residential community, which continues to provide the foundation for both shop patrons and transit ridership. Shaker Square locates parking to the rear of stores to preserve the historic character and accommodate pedestrians. Walkable, appealing streetscapes lead to the station and a public green, reinforcing the Square as the center of community activity.   •  Encourage public-private partnerships.  The combined clout of private development know-how with public resources and informational mechanisms for raising public awareness can greatly assist in a retail redevelopment of any scale.   •  Reach out to the public early and often.  CenterPoint made a substantial investment in community outreach. Their programs were not only informed by those contacts, but the investment laid the foundation for community support for renovation plans, public participation in financing, and ultimately patronage of transit and stores as well.      Back to top   Evanston, Illinois   Bustling 'Burb Boasts Intermodal Connection   DAVIS STREET TRANSPORTATION CENTER DEVELOPMENT   Evanston, a suburban city 13 miles north of Chicago's Loop along Lake Michigan, has been linked to Chicago throughout its history by rail lines, trolleys, and buses. Incorporated in the late 1800s, Evanston is now home to 74,000 people.   Evanston's recently completed Davis Street Transportation Center has given the community a single facility to serve as a hub for commuter rail (Metra), regional subway (the Chicago Transit Authority), and suburban bus services (PACE). The Transportation Center is the only transfer point outside the City of Chicago that brings all three transit providers together. As a result, the Davis Street Center is the twelfth most active transfer point in the Chicago region.   More than just a connection for rail and bus service, however, the Davis Street Transportation Center is a strong contributor to the broader redevelopment of downtown Evanston. Coupled with focused investment within the station area, Evanston has strengthened its overall market appeal for employers, while providing creative housing and retail opportunities to draw residents downtown, and offering incentives to developers to preserve and reuse historic commercial buildings.   Evanston's current comprehensive plan emphasizes creating ""an attractive, convenient, and economically vibrant"" mixed-use downtown, and offering ""safe, affordable, and easily accessible alternatives to the automobile."" The earlier development patterns support these goals well. Developers are finding new uses for older assets, supported by transit service and anchored by the Davis Street Transportation Center.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   Downtown Evanston developed as a traditional suburban center with a mix of retail and small office space, pedestrian facilities, strong public transit service, and a variety of architectural styles. As shopping centers were built along new highways, retail activity in Evanston's downtown declined. But the pedestrian orientation, mix of architectural styles, and access to public transportation remained.   Redevelopment efforts during the late 1980s focused on creating office space for high-tech organizations, which in turn led to the construction of the Evanston Research Park in downtown, on land located between the Chicago Transit Agency (CTA) and Metra rail lines.   Beyond the Research Park initiative, the city's redevelopment plan for downtown Evanston emphasized mixed uses, including residential, and creating a ""24/7"" environment. Early projects included a hotel, a movie complex, additional parking, a grocery, 280 rental apartments, and a new office tower near the Davis Street Transportation Center. The growth of traffic congestion throughout the Chicago metropolitan area, changing demographics, and the desire for urban amenities without all the urban headaches helped to make the 1990s the strongest real estate market since the 1920s for Evanston. The new area of development is focused within walking distance of the Transportation Center.    REDEVELOPING YESTERDAY'S EVANSTON FOR TODAY   A number of older buildings are within walking distance of the Davis Street Transportation Center. Many of these buildings have been adapted to new uses. The variety of architectural styles and periods contributes to Evanston's uniqueness, and the physical context provides an interesting place where people want to be.   To support its redevelopment efforts, Evanston uses tax increment financing (TIF) districts to fund extraordinary costs for site preparation such as the cost of demolition, environmental remediation, parking structures, and streetscape improvements. The City of Evanston does not usually use tax abatements. The county provides for reduced assessments for landmark buildings and reimbursement of state sales tax.   Developers have recognized the market appeal of a downtown location with easy access to good transit services, as well as the advantages of redeveloping older buildings. The Davis Street Land Company, for example, has transformed the Chandler's Building (a 25,000 square-foot former variety store built in 1929) into a mixed-use development with ground-level retail and office space above . The project, located one block from the Davis Transportation Center, involved tearing down a smaller nineteenth century structure that was determined to be unusable and redeveloping the five-story L-shaped 1929 building. The county designated the building a historic landmark and granted it a 10-year tax abatement, a critical element in the project's success. No parking was provided for the project. The developer, who spent $4.3 million on the project, also made use of the federal historic rehabilitation tax credits.   Image: Left and Below: The Davis Street Transportation Center in Evanston, Illinois is a hub for intermodal transportation serving the community.   The City of Evanston participated in financing the costs of the public plaza in front of the building through a TIF district.   A former Marshall Field department store built circa 1910 has been converted into 55 condominiums with 43,000 square feet of commercial/retail space, including a community church. The building at 807 Church Street is located in the heart of downtown, just a short walk from the Davis Street Transportation Center. The developer, Creative Designs and Builders, transformed the building into rental housing in the early 1980s, converting to market-rate condominiums in 2001. The cost of transforming the department store to housing was $4.2 million, all financed privately.   In recognition of the importance of pedestrian facilities to downtown redevelopment and transit access, Evanston created a special service district in the downtown to provide for pedestrian and streetscape improvements, and property owners agreed to tax themselves to provide funding for these improvements.   Parking spaces have been added in the downtown to support the new development. In one garage, the 1,400 spaces are shared (commuters use the spaces during the daytime, and retail and movie goers use the spaces during the evenings and on weekends). The city encourages shared parking to reduce the overall number of spaces required to serve the different, non-competing uses.    Image: The historic Chandler's building shown here during a veteran's parade through downtown Evanston, now offers mixed retail and office space in 25,000 square feet, just steps from the new Davis Street Transportation Center.    Signs of success   Evanston is enjoying its strongest real estate market since the 1920s, as developers and citizens discover that close-in suburbs offer a mixture of architectural styles, around-the-clock activities, and the convenience of a good pedestrian environment and transit alternatives.   From 1998 to 2003 more than $300 million of private funds have been or will be invested in more than 600,000 square feet of commercial/retail space, more than 1,000 residential units, and almost 3,000 new parking spaces.   New and old buildings together have created a renewed ""sense of place,"" which is leading to more proposals for residential, retail, and commercial spaces. As older buildings are converted to new uses, they have added to Evanston's revenue base through sales and real estate taxes. On the Chandler Building, Evanston has more than doubled its tax revenue from sales and real estate taxes as a result of the rehabilitation, even with the landmark tax abatement.   Transit ridership accounts for more than 12,000 weekday trips to and from downtown Evanston. Metra, the commuter rail operator, has had the greatest growth in riders, almost 150 percent between 1983 and 1999. CTA rail accounts for the greatest number of trips, roughly 7,000 each weekday.   The development and redevelopment in downtown Evanston have increased off-peak weekend trips as well as weekday. As the downtown adds new office, residential, and retail uses, the market for transit grows. The relationship is synergistic: Good transit encourages more development, which in turn increases transit ridership.    Lessons learned   •  Use local transit planning efforts to give your community a sense of direction and commitment, opening the way to private-sector development and investment.  When Evanston sought to revitalize its downtown in the 1980s, it put forward a comprehensive vision and set of planning goals to encourage transit use, retail, and new workers in the suburban center. Improvements to the transit infrastructure through the Davis Street Center have reinforced the local planning efforts.  •  Encourage a mixture of old and new buildings that offers a physical context and visual interest, and that adapts to a range of activities.  Most older suburban areas have the infrastructure and range of building types to attract new uses and activities. These areas also have underdeveloped lots and sometimes brownfields that are available for new development. Evanston's planning guidelines provide for a variety of uses and building types, making the downtown equally attractive for historic preservation projects, adaptive reuse, and new construction.

Although the Maryland Transit Administration operates a MARC commuter rail line through Gaithersburg, and a historic 1884 commuter train station stands at the town center, commuter service was perceived as a means for residents to leave Gaithersburg for job locations elsewhere, not a mechanism for attracting riders to Gaithersburg.   Gaithersburg town officials were seeking ways to create a mixture of land uses downtown; attract new business patrons, workers, and residents; make better use of existing and often historic properties; and stimulate complementary infill projects that reinforced traditional small-town character. An overarching objective was to accommodate automobile parking for all those hoped-for new workers, visitors, and employees. By adopting a progressive parking strategy, Gaithersburg is not only achieving its primary objectives, but has set in motion a dynamic that is creating transit synergies as well.   Gaithersburg offers insights into how a town can revitalize its historic resources, address current parking needs while evolving to greater transit use and development that recognizes the transit connection as beneficial.     COMMUNITY HISTORY   Gaithersburg's pattern of growth and disinvestment in the 20th century mirrors that of many small towns throughout the Chesapeake Bay region. Its downtown, once the market and freight center for a flourishing agricultural community, has maintained its low scale, historic character, and charm, and rapid residential expansion from the 1950s onward occurred mostly in suburban subdivisions at the fringes. Retail and commercial centers (conventional strip centers, office parks, and malls) were also located on the perimeter of the downtown, siphoning off most business revenue.   The cherished character of the historic core was threatened. Several traditional downtown businesses, such as the large Southern States store, no longer met changing market demand. As these anchors slipped, the number of patrons for remaining stores also declined. Many shop owners and businesses were just hanging on by the 1990s, when revitalization efforts began.    TOWN AND PARKING   In early 1995, a diverse group of concerned citizens, property owners, and civic leaders recognized that Olde Town Gaithersburg was at a crossroads. Although individual projects, such as the restoration of the small historic commuter station, were important, a more comprehensive approach was needed. The city hired internationally known town planner Andres Duany to conduct an intensive community charette to flesh out ideas. About a year later, after continued discussion and refinement, consensus around a downtown plan emerged.   A key concept of the plan was accommodating parking to the side and rear of buildings whenever possible. This approach supported the restoration of historic properties, rather than their removal for parking lots, and encouraged developers to site complementary infill projects at the traditional building line to maintain the pedestrian feel of the street. In combination with a program for calming through-traffic and improving streetscapes, this strategy promised an environment that was convenient, walkable, and attractive.   Another important concept was investment in municipal parking garages. Land was scarce and demand for parking was rising. Decked parking not only reduced the pressure to raze existing properties for surface lots, but made possible redevelopment of vacant and underutilized properties as well. Without a garage and the regulatory framework allowing existing and new projects to meet parking needs, potential infill lots would likely be retained for parking. Land economics in Gaithersburg simply did not support private investment in a garage, and so public investment was essential.

Image: Landscaping and public art enliven the area surrounding Gaithersburg's historic train station and nearby municipal parking.   WHERE TO START   The sector of Olde Towne targeted for initial redevelopment was situated immediately south of the railroad tracks and west of the town's main street, Summit Avenue. Principal uses included the Southern States store and scattered surface parking lots. The lots were used by shoppers and commuters boarding MARC trains (Maryland's commuter railroad) at the restored station opposite Summit Avenue. Just to the north is Olde Towne's historic district, which includes most of the area's shops and restaurants.   Redevelopment concepts emerging from Duany's work called for a new commercial project to be located along Summit Avenue on a parcel owned by the city and used by MARC commuters for parking. A large adjacent parcel, occupied by the Southern States store, would also be repositioned. On it would be a multi-story parking garage next to the railroad tracks, where it would provide a buffer from train noise. Parcels fronting the garage along Summit Avenue would be redeveloped for office and retail uses. A realigned street would border the southern portion of the sector, again with a redevelopment pad between the street and parking garage. Apartments were suggested for that parcel.   The parking garage, projected at approximately 700 spaces, was to serve several uses. About one-third of the spaces would be used by MARC commuters, with the rest devoted to meeting the needs of the new development projects on fronting lots, as well as the general public. On evenings and weekends, when commuting and worker demand is low, spaces would be available for shoppers and visitors attending cultural and civic events.    GETTING THE FIRST PROJECT ON THE GROUND   By 1997, City Manager Dave Humpton was receiving inquiries from developers. Town officials decided to look first at the infill possibilities for the MARC commuter parking lot along Summit Avenue. Municipal ownership of this key parcel provided the best opportunity for influencing the quality of development. The city also owned another lot in the vicinity where parking could be relocated with little inconvenience. The city issued a Request for Proposals.   Steve Virostek of the DANAC Corporation, a local development company, proposed an office project to bring daytime employment to Olde Town. Virostek knew this type of project would not be an easy sell to prospective tenants. To compete with the spacious suburban office parks nearby, DANAC would have to offer higher-quality design and finishes than the competition -- with lower rents. To afford that combination, and address the risks listed by financial partners, he would need the city to be a partner.   Not only did Gaithersburg's officials select DANAC's proposal, Mayor Ed Borher and City Manager Dave Humpton enthusiastically supported DANAC's development program and financial incentive package. The City Council agreed to contribute its property to the project. To ensure that the project set the bar high for quality building and streetscape design that complemented the downtown's historic character, the city also provided a $1 million loan to DANAC, to be repaid interest free through DANAC's dedication of half of the cash flow from the project. DANAC assumed all responsibility for both the office and public space improvements, and for getting underway immediately. DANAC also assumed the biggest financial risk: whether the project could attract office tenants to the 42,000- square-foot project.   By May 1998, when the ribbon was cut, the project was already 100 percent leased. Virostek credits the city's willingness to help finance more expensive tenant finishes, such as sound attenuation from the warning blasts of CSX freight trains as they crossed Summit Avenue.    MORE SUCCESS   Encouraged by the success of his initial project and the partnership enjoyed with the city, Virostek explored purchase of the adjacent parcel owned and occupied by Southern States. The company was ready to sell, but the site was contaminated by leakage from an old underground petroleum storage tank. After testing and negotiation about the clean-up costs, DANAC entered into a contract to purchase the parcel.   During the clean-up, Virostek began discussions with Humpton and other town officials on a detailed reuse program for the property. By 1999, DANAC and the city had reached agreement. While modifications were made to Duany's concept, the basic components remained.   A multi-story rental apartment, with first-floor retail space (68 units and 20,000 square feet retail/service) would be constructed on the south parcel, which DANAC had sold to the Magruder Companies, an area residential company. DANAC would build and own an office building of approximately 65,000 square feet, with 6,000 square feet held in reserve for retail development as the market matured. Although higher in density and scale than the predominant pattern, the project was carefully designed to complement the character of the town and its abutting historic district. Quality materials and finishes would again be used. The city would begin immediately to implement the planned infrastructure and streetscape upgrades in the sector, targeting completion to coincide with the opening of the private projects. The city forgave half of its permit fees.   The agreement also specified how the 720-space parking garage component would be built and managed:   • The city bought the parcel for the parking garage from DANAC for $750,000. Gaithersburg would own both the land and the garage and would be responsible for operation and management.  • Under a negotiated agreement, the city hired DANAC as its development manager to construct the garage. DANAC was responsible for overseeing all aspects of design and development, subject to city approval. A not-to-exceed fee was set at $6,925,000. DANAC assumed the risk of overruns and agreed not to take any fee for its management or personnel expenses.  • In consideration of services provided by DANAC, the city agreed to reserve 126 spaces for the new, multi-family housing project. Another 200 spaces were reserved for the office project. All remaining spaces were for the general public. Spaces were allotted to a planned restaurant, but not formally reserved.  • MARC commuters were expected to use spaces set aside for the general public, and DANAC agreed to construct a pedestrian bridge across the railroad tracks, connecting to the historic district and providing convenient access to the train station along reconstructed streets.  • The city has no current plans to charge for parking. In the future, payments by the housing and office projects would be imposed on negotiated schedules. The schedule for office workers provides an initial period of no parking charges and rises to 100 percent of the fee charged to the general public over a 20-year period. The residential fee schedule is more generous, and provides for a 30-year phase-in period.    Image: The pedestrian scale of Gaithersburg's historic Olde Towne has not been disturbed by new nearby development.     FINANCING   The combined public/private price tag for the project was estimated at $42.3 million. Costs of land and improvements for the office, residential, and restaurant projects would be approximately $13.4 million, to be shouldered by the developers. The remaining $28.9 million was to be raised from public funds to acquire the parcel, construct the garage, and rebuild public infrastructure. Costs included acquisition of land for street realignment and streetscape improvements (brick sidewalks, lighting, signage, benches, trash receptacles, intersection improvements, and underground utilities).   Fiscally conservative Gaithersburg had always maintained a ""pay-as-you-go"" philosophy. The city was prepared to take on the lion's share of public costs from its capital accounts, but it needed partners for the rest. Over several months it aggressively lobbied county and state officials for support. At the same time, Humpton worked closely with Virostek to ensure that the schedule for payment of the city's obligations for the garage would coincide with funding cycles. In the end, $24,900,000 was secured from three public sources over a three-year period from fiscal years 1999 through 2001: $13,100,000 in cash, reserves, and anticipated tax revenues from the City of Gaithersburg; $5,800,000 in cash or General Obligation bonds from Montgomery County; and $6,000,000 in cash and Smart Growth grants from the State of Maryland. Although $4 million short of the full funding estimate, these committed funds were adequate to satisfy all partners that enough work would be completed to allow the project to proceed. The city pledged to continue to work with the state to identify additional funding, possibly through state transportation programs, and if not feasible, through a combination of its own and private funds.    Signs of success   Like the first phase, the second phase has been a strong success. By 2001, the three main components of the project (the apartment, office complex, and garage) were completed and occupied. Infrastructure and streetscape improvements were in place. There have been numerous expressions of interest in the restaurant pad, which is still undeveloped.   Initially, Virostek lured a high-tech company as the prime tenant for the office. With the downturn of that sector of the economy, the tenancy evaporated. Replacement tenants were relatively easy to find, however. The office leased ahead of schedule, and met or exceeded rent projections. Virostek reports that some tenants cited the location on the MARC commuter line as a consideration in taking space.   Similarly, the apartments were snatched up more quickly and at higher rents than projected. The Magruder Companies actively marketed the project's location on the MARC commuter line. While definitive surveys on transit use have not been completed, project manager Scott Reed and leasing director Nancy Malloy observe that a number of tenants commute to work by transit, and the service was cited as a reason for renting units. ""The transit connection is a definite plus,"" says Malloy.   The garage is functioning well. Its brick facade and decorative tower and pedestrian bridge complement the character of the adjacent historic district. Most of the MARC line's nearly 300 daily commuters are using the fourth floor and pedestrian bridge, as designed. This frees the lower levels for shorter-term visitors to local businesses. Shop owners report having employees use the garage, making street spaces adjacent to their businesses available for patrons.   On most days the garage operates at well below capacity. Far from suggesting overbuild, Humpton sees this excess capacity as an investment. Plans are underway for additional development projects to the rear of the garage site. Allocating spaces to those projects, thus reducing costs to the eventual developer, is being considered as a tool to leverage the same type of quality and design exemplified by the DANAC and Magruder projects.   Most importantly, the development, parking, and streetscape projects have breathed new life into Olde Towne, while maintaining desired small town charm. More jobs and retail activity are located in Olde Towne now, although additional market support is still needed. The success of the initial projects has laid the foundation for continued residential and commercial infill projects and for adaptive reuse of underutilized historic properties.

Although the presence of MARC commuter service to the community was a factor in the city's redevelopment scheme, city officials were more focused on the current buzz about smart growth and new urbanism. Whatever the motivation, Gaithersburg's adoption of a progressive parking plan -- and subsequent urban design guidelines and zoning that support both historic preservation and new downtown development -- shows how parking design can encourage compact growth and help accomplish transit-oriented design.   Some advocates for transit-oriented development have promoted imposed limitations on parking around station stops to encourage transit use. Likewise, some preservationists have sought to reduce or limit parking in historic areas. Given the practical realities of auto dependence in Gaithersburg, however, its leadership recognized that parking needed to be maintained and expanded. By opting for a strategy that focused on parking design and management approaches, the city provides an example that may be applicable to other commuter towns. In a very real sense, Gaithersburg's parking strategy has facilitated both increased preservation and construction of transit-supportive projects. The garage also provides a venue for monitoring parking demand as revitalization continues --  with the flexibility to use that experience to adjust allocation of parking and encourage additional transit-supportive projects as the automobile-transit dynamic evolves.   •  Put muscle and money where your mouth is.  Beyond a good framework, the critical decision Gaithersburg made was to support its progressive parking approach with investment of public personnel, property assets, and funding to see the project through.  •  Private developers and public entities need each other.  The public and private sectors in Gaithersburg each brought their own resources to the table, and created a successful downtown strategy that took advantage of what each sector could offer. Virostek and DANAC brought market savvy, persistence, and creativity to the table. Mayor Bohrer and City Manager Humpton brought a specific vision for the downtown, city-owned property, funding, and connections to county and state officials with whom they aggressively pursued partnerships.  •  Don't create parking for parking's sake . The Gaithersburg parking garage was conceived as a tool to leverage achievement of the city's objectives for land use, urban design, historic preservation, and economic development. The garage is a critical element in the success of the new development projects. The garage is also designed to support instead of undermine the historic character of the town and the attractiveness of transit to its residents and employees.   Image: New development across from Gaithersburg's historic train station reflects similar design elements to those of the station.      Back to top   Memphis, Tennessee   South Main is Happening   ADAPTIVE REUSE AS A STRATEGIC URBAN NEIGHBORHOOD INVESTMENT   Back when ""cotton was king,"" the South Main section of Memphis was bustling. Today, the warehouses and factories of Memphis's South Main historic district are being filled with residents, artist studios, galleries, local restaurants, and locally owned shops. Strategic public investments catalyzed South Main's rebirth, and local private investors rescued the area and gave it new life.   The rebirth of South Main began with the restoration of a downtown trolley system in 1993 and renovation of Central Station as a mixed-use intermodal center at the southern end of downtown. The new National Civil Rights Museum is among the attractions that have motivated visitors to take the trolley into the South Main area.   Most of the pioneering developers and investors in South Main are Memphis-based individuals with a personal connection to local history. No mega-projects or large public subsidies have been necessary to entice developers. With the area's rebirth have come increasing trolley ridership, tourism, and housing opportunities downtown.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   Up to 50 trains a day once delivered passengers and cargo to South Main via Central Station. The post-war period, however, saw rapid decline of both rail travelers and the industries that sustained business activity. The downtown trolley system was dismantled after World War II. Many of the handsome historic buildings lining South Main Street fell into disrepair, vacancy, and virtual abandonment.   An effort to revitalize downtown with a pedestrian mall in the 1970s failed. By the late 1980s, the mall was actually seen as contributing to lack of mobility and parking problems in the South Main area.   In 1993, Memphis inaugurated the first leg of the Main Street Trolley system in the right-of-way of Main Street. This two-track line largely traced the route of the old streetcar line. By 1997, the single-track Riverfront Loop was added, doubling the system's length to five miles. Most of the new segment used existing railroad tracks located parallel to Main Street and running along the bluffs fronting the Mississippi River, before reconnecting to Main Street at the south and north ends.    DOWNTOWN TROLLEY AND CENTRAL STATION   More than just a downtown circulator, the Main Street Trolley connects to the city's bus system through transfer facilities and park-and-ride lots at its north terminus and through bus, park-and-ride, and Amtrak connections at the south terminus, the recently renovated Central Station.   Initially criticized as a gimmick to save downtown, the trolley has nonetheless succeeded. Ridership has grown from just short of 500,000 in the first year of operation to about one million in 2002. Tom Fox, director of planning and capital projects for the Memphis Area Transit Agency (MATA), estimates that approximately half of the riders use the trolley to commute, run errands, and make work-related trips. The other half are made by tourists, visitors, and residents in pursuit of entertainment. Jeff Sanford, president of Memphis Center City Commission, which plans for and promotes downtown's economic development, believes the trolley has helped draw more than $2 billion in project investments in downtown during recent years, especially in the South Main area.   Built in 1914, Central Station was the last building designed by Daniel Burnham. In the early 1990s, MATA officials planned to transform the then-derelict building into an intermodal terminal for the trolley, bus services, and the remaining twice-daily Amtrak trains. MATA also sought new uses for long-vacant office and retail spaces that were part of the complex. In 1995, MATA acquired the building and, after securing federal, state, and city funding, joined with city agencies, the Center City Commission, preservationists, and neighborhood groups to devise a plan for the station's rebirth.   Judith Johnson, who was then a preservation analyst for the City of Memphis and is now principal of the preservation consulting firm Judith Johnson and Associates, suggested the use of historic preservation tax credits. MATA asked the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Community Partners Program to join the planning team. That collaboration resulted in a palette of potential uses for the space and, importantly, a proposed ownership structure that could make use of tax credits. As a public agency, MATA could not use the credits. The stakeholders decided to form an independent, for-profit limited partnership that would include MATA. Through a Request for Proposals process, the Alexander Company of Madison, Wisconsin was selected as a private partner. Over a period of approximately 15 months, the partnership developed a program for restoring Central Station, structured a partnership agreement that met with all parties' approval, and secured funding to accomplish the program. The restoration was completed in 1999.   About 30,000 Memphis residents and officials gathered in December 1999 to celebrate Central Station's rebirth. In addition to the intermodal component, the project includes 63 apartment units occupying former office space, three storefront retail spaces, a precinct police station, and a conference area adjacent to the fully restored Main Hall. Total project costs were approximately $23.3 million. In addition to the $17.9 million from federal, state, and city sources, the project received $3.0 million in preservation tax credits, $2.4 million in bank financing, and $0.1 million from Amtrak.    SOUTH MAIN NEIGHBORHOOD   The most remarkable outcome of the trolley and Central Station efforts is how they catalyzed private-sector activity along South Main. Placed on the National Register in 1982, the South Main historic district includes approximately 90 buildings, all but a few determined as contributing to its historic character. More than 60 percent of South Main's historic buildings had been renovated by 2002. Historic properties are also being restored in areas adjacent to South Main. Infill construction on vacant lots is also taking place. Virtually all this reinvestment has occurred since start-up of the trolley, and the majority has occurred in the years after Central Station was restored.   Image: Memphis's Central Station was restored for intermodal service and mixed residential-commercial use with the aid of federal historic preservation tax credits.   Most of this activity has been undertaken by a half-dozen smaller developer/investors who recognized South Main's potential, had sufficient financial capacity to acquire and improve buildings, and have been successful in their risks, enabling them to invest in additional projects.   One such investor is Phil Woodard. Owner of a local plumbing business, Woodard used to visit South Main with his father as a child. He purchased his first small building at a modest price in 1994. Today, Woodard has completed ten buildings in South Main and vicinity, all benefiting from a tax freeze the Center City Commission provides to downtown investors, as well as the federal preservation tax credit.   Woodard saw the potential to attract residential tenants to upper-story apartments, with first-floor retail and commercial space. Previous planning work and examples from other jurisdictions suggested that an arts and entertainment focus might work. Artists were recognized as willing to pioneer in untested areas to take advantage of low-cost space. The converted warehouses, factories, and shops offered adaptable space for artists, arts organizations, and restaurateurs. And the trolley promised to bring patrons to the area.   Woodard and his wife Terry joined with other local business partners to create the South Main Association. Artists and gallery owners became interested and began to sign leases, albeit at very low rents. Small businesses have leased much of the first-floor space in renovated buildings, providing services in keeping with the urban lifestyle residential tenants seek.    Signs of success   South Main's success is generating new riders for MATA. Woodard estimates that between 20 and 30 percent of his tenants use the trolley to go to work in the downtown core, a figure he suspects holds for other residential projects in the area. Most of the others commute by car to jobs east of the city center. That may change when MATA completes a new, interconnecting rail line in that direction. Meanwhile, Woodard estimates that almost all tenants use the trolley for evening and weekend use. ""They park their cars on Friday evening and don't get in them again until Monday morning.""   The trolley is bringing more customers to area shops and restaurants. In November 2000 the South Main Association inaugurated a free trolley tour on the last Friday of each month to promote the area. Initially, the association rented the trolley from MATA for $300 per evening, and attracted 50 or 60 people. Within the first year, more than 3,000 riders participated. ""We actually had a problem, because we only had about 18 art galleries on the tour at that time. They were packed to overcapacity. Now, we have about 30 restaurants and shops on the tour, and folks can find enough room,"" says Woodard. MATA and the association now provide the tour in partnership: MATA provides the trolley and operator, while the association offers promotion and advertising.   There is little doubt that the investments in the trolley and Central Station played a major role in alerting investors to the latent opportunities on South Main. Once aware of the opportunities, and with prudent continuing financial assistance, Memphis found that investors were willing to assume the risk of restoring the historic buildings. Because the projects were small, they created an opportunity to test and mature the market. And when the market was proven, the historic properties enabled a number of smaller developer/investors to quickly capitalize on their investments.   Property values in South Main have tripled, according to Woodard: ""When I started, you could buy buildings for $8 a square foot and there were plenty of them. Now, six years later, it's hard to find anything and you have to pay $24 a foot."" But that has not discouraged him from continuing to invest. A handful of projects are underway and more are planned.   The development of South Main produced significant new support for transit not only from the new residential and business expansion along the trolley line, but in the greater Memphis area as well. Having been introduced to rail transit, residents are demanding more. Observing the success at South Main, the business and development community is eager to invest in historic preservation projects adjacent to transit lines.

The EPA and MDE originally sought to make                        the approximately $700 million investment in five years,                        which would have sharply raised annual sewer bills. The                        City of Baltimore originally proposed a 15-year timeline,                        which would have achieved environmental protection, while                        lessening the extreme burden on senior citizens living on                        fixed incomes and other low-income customers. Negotiations                        resulted in a 14-year timeline.                        The agreement will fix sources of sewage overflows                        and update Baltimore's aging wastewater infrastructure.                        But while the federal and State governments required the                        action - which will cost approximately $700 million - by                        threatening litigation, neither is providing any direct                        funding toward this project. Local ratepayers will pay the                        entire cost of this enforcement action.                        A recent draft EPA report found that a $650                        billion investment would be required nationally to address                        this problem. But the Bush Administration and the Congress                        have introduced proposals that provide just $7 billion annually,                        for five years, into state loan pools to pay for improvements.                        According to an April 10, 2002  New                        York Times article  on the draft report: ""The problem,                        many experts say, cannot be solved only with added local                        user fees, because sharp increases would push rates so high                        that no one could pay them and urban economies would stall.""                                             Even                        with increases in water and sewer rates this year, Baltimore                        continues to offer some of the lowest rates in the region                        and along the East Coast. Average quarterly charges for                        Baltimore would increase to $129 under the new agreement.                        Boston charges $211, Atlanta $199, Washington, Dc $175,                        Philadelphia $158 and New York $136 for the same service.                        Montgomery and Prince George's County residents pay $224                        per quarter, Carroll County $222, Baltimore County $172,                        Harford County $171 and Anne Arundel County $159.                        Many                        people will claim credit for the environmental benefit of                        this agreement. But the bill for protecting a national treasure                        - the Chesapeake Bay - will get sent to the poorest jurisdiction                        in the nation's richest state.

As always, thank you for everything you are                        doing to make the greatest city in America even greater.                                             CitiStat: One Call                        For City Hall                       Lately                        a lot of you have been calling our number - 311. In fact,                        in the first two-week period after our official  Call                        Center launch , almost 30,000 calls for information and                        service were received.                        Hardly a  CitiStat                         meeting goes by these days when we don't ""cold call"" the                        311 center to make sure that calls are not only being answered                        promptly and courteously, but that our team of customer                        service representatives are providing callers service request                        tracking numbers so that citizens can regularly check back                        on the status of requests.                        Those service request numbers, also know                        as ""SRs,"" are essentially a receipt for citizens to verify                        that their requests have been registered. CitiStat is constantly                        monitoring departments' SR levels through the automated                        CitiTrack system, keeping close tabs on the public's demand                        for service and the timeliness of their responses.                        Please keep those calls coming. We've recently                        developed target time intervals for the most frequent types                        of service requests. Our 48-hour pothole guarantee and our                        efforts to keep many of Baltimore's gateways clean from                        graffiti, with daily abatements, are just two examples.                        While service requests such as cleaning illegal dump sites                        and vacant properties might take considerably longer, we're                        continuing to do our best to both create and met the public's                        expectations for effective city services.                        CitiStat                        Report of the Week : This week, the Housing Authority                        of Baltimore City (HABC) is online.

Although Marc                        and I sometimes have policy ideas of differing vintages,                        he cares deeply about our city and its people - and works                        every day to keep people thinking about how to make Baltimore                        better.                        It is clearly good news that he had the guts                        to stick his neck out to keep our public radio station in                        local hands. As an occasional guest on his show, I wish                        him luck, and look forward to a new outlet providing local                        news coverage.

GX051-98-9629505	"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  Office of Community Planning and Development                   CITIZEN'S SUMMARY   Macon is a central Georgia city of a little over 100,000 persons. Its Consolidated Plan addresses economic and social problems from a family perspective and makes recommendations focusing on the development and expansion of social programs with a holistic, family-centered approach. Macon's problems have mirrored national problems which have decreased family well-being over the years. Conditions have resulted in an inter-generational dependence on the welfare system as a source of income and medical care. The city's approach is that families should receive support to remain intact or to be reunited whenever possible.    Action Plan   For the first year of the Consolidated Plan, the city of Macon is requesting $2,438,030 in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, $938,000 in HOME funds, and $86,000 from the Emergency Shelter Grant program. The bulk of Federal funds will be spent on housing programs.   Citizen Participation   A public notice invited citizens, public agencies, and other interested parties to present their input into Macon's Consolidated Plan on May 15, 1995. Another public notice invited nonprofit agencies interested in receiving CDBG funds to a pre-funding conference held in November 30, 1994. All meetings were open to public participation. Survey sheets for citizens' input on priority needs were distributed, and citizens, as well as all other agencies where meetings were held, were asked to complete the survey and return it after the hearing.     MAP 1  depicts points of interest in the jurisdiction.           COMMUNITY PROFILE   The 1990 census showed the population of Macon to be 106,610. Of the total, 52.2 percent are African American, 46.5 percent are white, and only 1.3 percent are from other minority groups.    In 1993 the average annual unemployment rate for Bibb County (in which Macon is located) was 6.1 percent compared to 5.8 percent for the State of Georgia, and 6.8 percent for the Nation. Labor force statistics by race showed that unemployment rates were 3.1 percent for whites and 11 percent for African Americans. Minorities, women, and youth have considerably higher unemployment rates than white males.    Per capita income for Bibb county in 1992 was $18,959. This was less than the national average, but above State and southeastern averages. Median household income for Bibb County in 1990 was $25,813 and for the State it was $29,021.   Census figures reveal that 19.2 percent of the population of Bibb County lived below the poverty level in 1989 ($12,674 for a family of four), compared with 14.6 percent for the State as a whole. Over 19 percent of the population aged 65 years and older lived below poverty in Bibb County, as did 41.1 percent of all female-headed households.    Macon is home to 41,227 households. 71 percent of which have income from wages and salaries. The remainder have income from self-employment, Social Security, public assistance, and retirement. The largest employer is Robins Air Force Base which is located 18 miles south of the city.   The city has a total of 45,499 housing units, 41,175 of them are occupied. Of these, about half are owner occupied and half are renter occupied. Elderly persons head 35 percent of the 21,315 homeowner households. Among these elderly homeowners, 20 percent own or occupy housing that is in need of repair, and almost all of them have incomes at or below 80 percent of the median. Four out of five of them have incomes below 51 percent of median.    Macon had 23,230 rental housing units in 1990 -- 20,730 of which were occupied. This resulted in a vacancy rate just under 11 percent. The census also reported that 35 percent of Macon's 19,912 renter households had incomes at or below 30 percent of median. Of the 7,044 renters with incomes below 30 percent of median, 77 percent lived in housing that needed repair.     MAP 2  depicts points of interest and low-moderate income areas.   MAP 3   depicts points of interest, low-moderate income areas, and minority concentration levels.   MAP 4   depicts points of interest, low-moderate income areas, and unemployment levels.          HOUSING AND COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT NEEDS   Conditions   The 1990 census found that almost one-third of Macon's 41,227 occupied housing units are in need of repair. Of these:     9,339 (23 percent) rental housing units need repair.    3,912 (9 percent) owner-occupied housing units need repair.      Among the non-elderly homeowners that live in housing in need of repair, 25 percent have incomes below 31 percent of median and 18 percent have incomes between 31 and 50 percent of median. Many of these housing units need major repairs to the building envelope; structural members; or to the electrical, plumbing, and heating systems to modernize them and bring them into compliance with all local codes. Typically the costs would run between $25,000 and $30,000 per housing unit. If lead paint must be abated, the cost of completely rehabilitating privately-owned houses jumps to $35,000 to $40,000.    Housing Needs   The demand for affordable and safe housing in inner-city neighborhoods is overwhelming to very low-income homeowners as shown by requests for home repair assistance. Most of the homeowner applicants are elderly persons with Social Security incomes between $400 and $600 per month.   There is a growing demand from low- and moderate-income renters and others to purchase single-family housing. The 7,044 renter households with incomes below 31 percent of median probably will not qualify to purchase a house until their incomes increase. Meanwhile, 77 percent of them live in housing that needs repair, but three-fourths pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing, and half pay more than 50 percent of their income toward housing costs.    As could be expected, there is a large demand for quality, affordable rental housing in Macon, particularly among persons with incomes under 31 percent of median. Unfortunately, debt service alone on high-quality rental housing frequently exceeds 30 percent of the income of very low-income renters.   Affordable Housing Needs   Macon simply does not have the money to address the needs of all low-income homeowners, particularly those with incomes below 50 percent of the median who are unable to borrow a substantial portion of the repair cost from a bank.    The census found that 29 percent of Macon's 41,227 households paid more than 30 percent of their income toward housing costs. Twenty of the 29 percent were renters and 9 percent were owners.    Even more cost burdened were the 13 percent of Macon's households that paid more than 50 percent of their income toward housing costs. Ten of 13 percent were renters and 3 percent were owners.   Macon has many inner-city housing needs and problems. The overall state of dilapidation and disinvestment found throughout many inner-city neighborhoods is of primary concern to the city. Therefore, Macon's strategic plan for housing will center on housing activities that can lead to the overall revitalization of inner-city and adjoining neighborhoods.   Homeless Needs   As many as 5,000 households in Macon may be at risk of homelessness in a given year. Persons most threatened with homelessness include:     Persons leaving institutions.     Households with incomes less than 31 percent of median.    Other low-income households with housing costs over 50 percent of income.    Victims of domestic violence.     Non-elderly, low-income single person households.       Macon's homelessness problem is not just confined to single persons in the downtown area. It also pervades single-parent families where children have no permanent residence.    A 1990 study estimated that there were 210 homeless people in downtown Macon, based on occupied shelter beds and a systematic, late night street survey. Detailed interviews of 100 of the 210 homeless found that the overwhelming majority were between 30 to 59 years of age and 91 percent were male. Fifty-one percent were African American, 48 percent were Caucasian, and 1 percent were of other minorities. The average length of homelessness was 2 years but the median for homelessness was 1 year. Twenty-three percent had been previously homeless. The five major causes for homelessness among those surveyed were mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse, lack of supportive family relationships, lack of employment, and health-care related issues.   Macon intends to address homelessness by improving the coordination among organizations and agencies delivering services and reducing the number of homeless persons living on the streets and under bridges.   Public and Assisted Housing Needs   The Macon Housing Authority (MHA) has 2,239 units of public housing. It also administers 1,750 Section 8 vouchers and/or certificates. The 1995 5-year plan includes modernization of Anthony Homes public housing. The total cost of modernization is approximately $8 million to be spread over three years. Modernization work is also scheduled for Oglethorpe Homes to complete some lead-based paint abatement.   MHA's Admissions and Continued Occupancy Plan requires MHA to maintain separate waiting lists for handicapped units. In March of 1995, there were 62 units that were designated as handicapped accessible. The current 5-year plan includes funds for an additional 18 handicapped units.    Barriers to Affordable Housing   Although Federal funds are vital to the city's affordable housing, regulations attached to the Federal programs often present obstacles to the city's affordable housing efforts. The city needs additional Federal funding in order to provide decent, safe, and affordable housing to very low-income residents -- many of whom are elderly and live on Social Security incomes of $400 to $600 per month.    The biggest local barriers to inner-city investment and revitalization are drugs and crime. Blight caused by vacant dilapidated houses, overgrown lots, ineffective code enforcement, and an ineffective judicial system are other major barriers. Locally adopted building, electrical, plumbing, and mechanical codes make it difficult to obtain a permit to repair or partially replace a system without having to bring the entire system up to current code. Water and sewer tap fees also add to the cost of inner-city development. Work on some of the needs such as more and better code enforcement and the need to focus money on micro-neighborhoods has already begun.    Fair Housing   Metro Fair Housing Services conducted a study on race discrimination in the metropolitan areas of Atlanta and Macon as part of a national study funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. This study showed that, ""overall, the incidence of housing discrimination was estimated at 56 percent for black renters; 50 percent for Hispanic renters; 59 percent for black homeowners; and 56 percent for Hispanic homebuyers."" One of the questions asked by prospective renters was how many apartments were available. The response to this question exposed the most blatant form of discrimination. A white or majority tester was told of several apartments that he/she could choose and the African-American tester was told that nothing was available. Macon ranked worst among 25 cities in the study in this category. In fact, HUD researchers estimate that an African-American person or couple looking for an apartment in Macon has an almost 60 percent chance of encountering unfair treatment at least once at this stage of the apartment search process.    The Federal Reserve conducted a study in 1991 which showed that African Americans in Macon/Warner Robins were turned down by banks for loans 27 percent of the time compared to 14 percent for white applicants.    Nevertheless, Metro Fair Housing is not aware of any housing discrimination suit against the jurisdiction. The majority of housing discrimination complaints have been in the rental area.   Lead-Based Paint   According to the 1990 census, 5,808 housing units in Macon were built before 1940, and therefore are most likely to have serious lead paint problems. The city has only limited Federal funding it can use to address housing and neighborhood revitalization problems. Given the current level of Federal funding, and the large number of houses needing basic repairs, Macon cannot afford an aggressive lead-based paint abatement, encasement, and/or encapsulation program in privately-owned housing.   According to data provided by the Macon/Bibb County District Public Health Department of the Georgia Department of Human Resources, 1,358 children under the age of 6 were tested for lead poisoning in Macon/Bibb County during 1994. The Health Department, following CDC guidelines, performed initial ""finger stick"" screening tests on the 1,358 children. As a result, 286 or 21 percent of the children were discovered to have lead level readings greater than 10 micrograms/dL. Children who fell into this category were tested a second time. None of these children required medical treatment and none were required to move from their homes.   Community Development Needs   In a survey on priority needs for 1995 Consolidated Plan, the following community development needs were identified by citizens and other agencies that were present in the meeting. These are:      Job training.     Community oriented policing programs.     Education on the homeowner rehabilitation program.     Single room occupancy housing.     Teen pregnancy program.     Homeowner rehabilitation.     Demolish dilapidated housing.     Sidewalk repair.     More coordination among homeless agencies.     Handicap accessibility.     Affordable day care facilities.     Battered women's shelter.     Psychological counseling for battered women and children.     Transportation for homeless people.     More services for the homeless.             HOUSING AND COMMUNITY   DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY   Vision for Change   Macon is striving toward a family-centered system that is comprehensive, preventive, family driven, integrated, developmental, flexible, sensitive to race, culture, gender, and disabilities, and outcome oriented. The following are Macon's community development goals and priorities:     Promote and improve social, physical, and economic environment for low-income families by affording all citizens the opportunity to grow socially, physically, and materially.    Expand and support infrastructure improvements that affect the quality of  life in low-income neighborhoods by improving and developing nonhousing infrastructure.    Strengthen service delivery to special needs populations by decreasing the number of special needs persons without supportive services or housing.    Promote safety and community involvement in low-income neighborhoods by reducing criminal activity in Macon.      Housing Priorities   The city believes that increasing homeownership in inner-city neighborhoods, will serve as a catalyst for private reinvestment. To expand affordable housing opportunities for low-income families Macon plans to:     Continue the housing repair program for low-income homeowners.    Continue the basic housing repair program for emergency repairs.    Promote rental housing repair through the Rental Property Improvement Program.    Promote and support code enforcement activities.    Expand and support neighborhood-based associations.    Encourage, support, and build capacity of nonprofit housing agencies.      Nonhousing Community Development Priorities   Macon also seeks to have a city/county where the rates of unemployment, inactivity, and underemployment are reduced by at least 2 percent.   Antipoverty Strategy   Of the $2,138,000 in CDBG funds that the city will receive, approximately $250,000 will assist nonprofit agencies that deal with problems that contribute to poverty such as low-income, lack of transportation, lack of child care, low self esteem, and lack of job training. More than $1 million of CDBG funds will directly assist low-income homeowners and renters obtain decent, safe, and affordable housing. HOME funds of $938,000 and Emergency Shelter Grants of $86,000 of will assist 40 first-time homebuyers and almost 100 homeless individuals.    Housing and Community Development Resources   Macon will continue to look to the Macon Housing Authority as the major source of quality and affordable housing for very low-income renters. While the city will continue to look for ways to make quality, affordable, and privately owned housing available to renters, the success of the plan will also depend on the availability of private sector financing.    The resources made available through the city, the Middle Georgia Consortium, the Macon Economic Development Council, and the Small Business Administration will provide for the implementation of most of the economic development strategies planned throughout the next 3 years. The primary funding sources for public facilities are the city's General Fund, a Section 108 loan, and CDBG. Funding for public improvements and public services will come from CDBG, with some funds coming from the General Fund. Funding for youth services in Macon comes mostly from public funds with some private nonprofit sources. Three Federal funding sources for the elderly are the Title 3 Older Americans Act, CDBG, and Social Service Block Grants that support nutrition, transportation, adult day care and homemaker services for seniors. Most services for the disabled are funded through the Home- and Community-based Waiver and the Mental Retardation Waiver Plan of the Medicaid Program.   Coordination of Strategic Plan   Economic development strategies will be coordinated primarily through partnerships between the city of Macon, the Middle Georgia Consortium, the Small Business Administration, and the Macon Economic Development Council. All of the public parks and recreational facilities within Macon and Bibb County are operated through the city's Park and Recreation Department. Macon will continue to work with the Junior City Council to ensure that the youth of Macon and Bibb County have their needs addressed. Macon's services network for the elderly and disabled is comprised primarily of governmental and nonprofit agencies that provide supportive housing and services.

A designated Transit Village is a municipality that has been recommended              for designation by the inter-agency Transit Village Task Force. These              municipalities have demonstrated a commitment to revitalizing and              redeveloping the area around its transit facility into a compact,               mixed-use  neighborhood with a strong residential              component.               A municipality can be designated a Transit Village only after much                of the planning and background work has already been done on the                municipal level. It may only be designated a Transit Village after                many of the  Transit Village Criteria                 have been met.                How many designated Transit Villages are there?                There are currently 14 designated Transit Villages. They are Pleasantville              (1999), Morristown (1999), Rutherford (1999), South Amboy (1999),              South Orange (1999), Riverside (2001), Rahway (2002), Metuchen (2003),              Belmar (2003), Bloomfield (2003), Bound Brook (2003), Collingswood              (2003), Cranford (2003) and Matawan (2003).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      South Amboy                                                                             South Orange                                                                            Morristown                                                                                                           What is mixed-use development?                    Mixed-use development is characterized by more than one use                    in a single building, a single development or neighborhood.                    An example is a five-story building with shops and stores on                    the first floor, offices on the second floor and apartments                    on the fourth and fifth floor. Another example is a residential                    block with a deli on one corner and a doctor's office on the                    other corner.                     The objective of mixed-use development is to increase housing                      opportunities within walking distance of shops, jobs, offices,                      restaurants, entertainment and cultural centers. By increasing                      opportunities for pedestrian activity, you reduce reliance                      on the automobile, reduce traffic congestion and pollution,                      boost the local economy and improve the feeling of safety                      and security.                                         What are the benefits of becoming a designated Transit Village?                                        Being designated a Transit Village provides a municipality with                    the following benefits:                                           State of New Jersey commitment to the municipality's vision                        for redevelopment                       Coordination among the state agencies that make up the                        Transit Village task force.                       Priority funding from some state agencies                       Technical assistance from some state agencies                       Eligibility for grants from annual $1 million in NJDOT's                        Transit Village funding                                          My municipality has met some of the criteria. Whom do I                      contact if we need additional planning assistance around the                      transit station?                    For municipalities that fall short of meeting the criteria but                    have the desire to become a Transit Village, several options                    are available for assistance to begin visioning and planning                    for the area around your transit station.                     NJ                      TRANSIT  can provide consultant assistance to municipalities                      interested in initiating a planning effort for a transit station                      area. NJ TRANSIT has also published a handbook entitled ""Planning                      for Transit-Friendly Land Use,"" designed to assist citizens,                      local officials and planning professionals interested in improving                      the coordination between land use planning and transit.

A municipality should also reach out to its county planning                      department to explore planning studies and other assistance                      that may be available.                      What state agencies make up the Transit Village Task Force?                    Along with NJDOT and NJ TRANSIT, there are nine other  state                    agencies partners  that make up the Transit Village Task                    Force. They are the Commerce and Economic Growth Commission,                    the Council on the Arts, the Department of Community Affairs,                    the Department of Environmental Protection, the Economic Development                    Authority, the Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, the Office                    of Smart Growth, Main Street New Jersey and the Redevelopment                    Authority.                     The Transit Village Task Force meets quarterly. The Task                      Force members work together to direct state funding into the                      designated Transit Villages to help achieve the redevelopment                      goals of the municipality.                                                              Whom should I contact for more information?

Youth on the street may say it is                 completely their choice to be homeless. They may say they just want to                 hang with their friends. This is a good way to maintain dignity or avoid                 talking about personal issues. When trust                                                                                                              is built with someone who is                 really able to provide help, the stories of sexual abuse, abandonment, and                 other trauma invariably come out .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Life on the streets is anything                 but fun .  It is a constant looking over your shoulder, guarding all                 your belongings from theft, looking for food, dry clothing and shelter,                 and continually feeling insults and nasty looks from passers by.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Myth:  MOST                 ARE RUNAWAYS.                                                                                                                                Many youth run away from home, and many                 runaway reports are filed with the police. Few of those runaways stay out                 for more than one or two nights and fewer still become homeless .                   Only 2-8% of youth served in                 homeless youth shelters have a runaway report filed on them .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Myth:  YOUTH DON’T WANT SERVICES.                                                                                                                                          Most youth do want help .                 They want to have a normal life, go to school, start a career, develop                 relationships. They just don’t know how with the limited resources                 available to them. Many services are difficult or impossible to access                 without a parent’s signature, proper identification, medical insurance,                 etc. Others have                                                                                                 long waiting lists. Waiting lists are difficult to use                 when the youth are moving around each night. Many homeless youth are                 distrustful of adults and social services. As much as they want a better                 life, they may be afraid to engage in services or cynical about the                 likelihood of getting real help. They have been let down a lot. But if                 trust can be slowly built, most do engage in services when they are                 available, and often do very well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Back to top                                                                         Underlying                  Causes of Youth Homelessness                                     There are many reasons that a youth may become homeless. Often it is a                 combination factors such as a mental illness, learning disability, or                 emotional issues; the actions or status of parents and other adults                 responsible for caring for the child; along with larger social issues such                 as racism, poverty and other forms of oppression. Rarely is youth                 homelessness clearly a symptom of personal economic crisis as it is for                 many homeless adults. However with the rising cost of housing, many young                 adults face insufficient income to maintain housing, especially those who                 have been in foster care or otherwise have little support from adults.                 While a wide range of circumstances might cause youth homelessness, there                 are three situations that stand out as common to large portions of the                 homeless youth population.                                     Family Conflict                                     Of the 673 youth entering shelters in King County, 60% indicated                 emotional conflict at home contributed to their need for shelter. A study                 of a sample of homeless youth in Seattle found that ""Although the                 reasons for leaving home varied considerably, conflict or fighting at home                 (53%) was named most frequently""1                   Many families have significant problems of one sort or another, but are                 able to manage some difficulties while a child is small. When the child                 becomes a teenager, new challenges emerge. The youth needs to establish                 increasing independence and may begin to express strong new emotions that                 adolescents often experience. These normal developmental processes added                 to ongoing stresses such as a child’s learning disability, a parent’s                 mental health or substance abuse issue, cultural assimilation issues, or                 poor parenting skills, make the level of conflict intolerable for the                 parents or the youth. Little or no help is available for such families,                 and eventually the youth is told to leave or runs away.                   Many of these situations could be prevented if adequate support were                 available for families with parenting issues, children with disabilities                 or other stresses that affect parent child relationships. Counseling,                 parenting skills training, parent/family support programs and intensive                 family intervention services are needed in far greater supply than current                 capacity. Support must be provided long term to maintain therapeutic gains                 and help parents deal with new challenges as children reach different                 developmental stages.                   1 Wert, S., Ginzler,                 J.A., Paradise, M., Cauce A.

Robertson and Toro conclude in                 their review of the literature on homeless youth, that ""across                 studies of homeless youth, rates of sexual abuse ranged from 17-35 percent                 and physical abuse ranges from 40-60%…Rates of Foster placements ranged                 from 21 percent to 53 percent."" 2                   More serious family issues may be identified early in a child’s life                 and she or he is removed from the home of an abusive or neglectful parent.                 A series of transitions between foster homes adds to the trauma                                                                                               of                          being                 abused and of being separated from parents. When the child becomes an                 adolescent, the effects of this trauma are very often acted out as running                 away and defiance or aggressiveness toward foster parents and other adults                 in authority. It becomes more and more difficult to find a placement for                 the youth and he or she eventually becomes homeless. Children involved in                 the juvenile justice system face even greater challenges in finding a                 placement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Children are often abused while in foster care as well. Development of                 high quality foster care is challenging, and inadequate resources exist                 for training, supporting and monitoring foster parents and group care                 providers. If longer term placements were provided, children might be                 exposed to less risk of being placed in an abusive situation.                   When a youth is living with an abusive parent, the Child Welfare System                 is less likely to intervene compared to the same situation with a younger                 child. Resources for investigation and placement are inadequate, and                 younger children are more vulnerable and therefore a higher priority for                 the use of scarce Child Welfare resources. The youth’s options are to                 suffer abuse or become homeless.                   More resources are needed throughout the system in child protection,                 family reconciliation, out of home placement and licensing. The HOPE Act                 has begun to address part of this issue in creating developmentally                 appropriate placement options for homeless teenagers. Much more must be                 done in order to provide protection and care for children whose parents                 cannot fill that role.                   2 Robertson, M.J., Toro,                 P.A.

High Cost of Housing                   The wage needed to afford a one bedroom apartment in King County is                 $11.91 per hour.3 Youth in foster care generally must leave when they turn                 18. State resources are no longer available for housing them once they are                 18 and finished high school. Many foster youth have developmental,                 academic or living skills deficits as a result of their stay in the foster                 care system, many school changes, and trauma they may have experienced.                 They are less likely than the average youth to be capable of supporting themselves, particularly in the current housing market. Other youth decide                 to leave home or are told to leave at age 18, 19 or 20 without the means                 to pay for adequate housing. Sometimes return home is no longer an option.                   Increases in the minimum wage to a living wage would allow more young                 adults to afford adequate housing. Short of that, homeless youth may need                 a housing subsidy or access to subsidized housing to replace the support                 that other youth receive from their parents. The state should be                 encouraged to maximize housing subsidies allowed in the Chaffee Foster                 Care Independence Act to assist foster youth in their transitions to                 independence. Skills in successful shared living should be included in                 independent living skills curricula.                   3 National Low Income                 Housing Coalition (September, 1999).

That is why we are expanding transit villages                            throughout the State and providing assistance to towns                            like Pleasantville who are using smart growth principles                            to plan around mass transportation, and not the automobile.”                                                       ""This                            $340,000 check is a testament to the Governor's commitment                            to Smart Growth, reducing congestion and increasing                            the quality of life for all New Jerseyans,"" said                            Transportation Commissioner Jack Lettiere. ""Transit                            Villages are an effective tool in our fight against                            sprawl and in making mass transit in our state a viable                            option, not a last resort.""                                                       “As                            we mayors like to say, ‘once a mayor, always a                            mayor,’ and we are certainly appreciative of this                            assistance from Governor McGreevey, who knows the impact                            that transportation projects like this one will have                            on our town,” said Mayor Peterson. “This money                            will be instrumental in our efforts to revitalize our                            downtown, as well as beautify the area surrounding bus                            terminal.”                                                       “This                            project is not just a building block for Pleasantville,                            but a positive step for regional planning,” said                            Senator William L. Gormley (R-Atlantic), who was also                            present at the announcement.                                                       The                            $340,000 will be used for parking improvements to Milan                            Avenue, which will be reconstructed to provide parking                            for the Pleasantville Bus Terminal and downtown businesses.                            In addition to 80 new spaces, the project will include                            the widening of sidewalks leading to the terminal, installation                            of new decorative street lights, repave sections of                            Milan Avenue and install a fence between Milan Avenue                            and adjacent railroad tracks. The money will also be                            used to build a sidewalk on Reading Avenue and for a                            traffic management study to help the town deal with                            the smart growth development that will occur.                                                       State’s                            Transit Village Initiative:                             The                            Transit Village program is designed to spur economic                            development, urban revitalization and private-sector                            investment around passenger rail stations. A designated                            Transit Village is a community with a bus, train, light                            rail or ferry station that developed a plan to achieve                            its goals.                                                       A                            municipality must demonstrate a commitment to smart                            growth planning and transit-oriented development, as                            well as a commitment to maintain the architectural history                            of the area, and create housing, cultural and commercial                            opportunities within walking distance of the facility.                                                       In                            January, the Governor set a goal to double the number                            of transit villages from 7 to 14.                            Including                            Pleasantville, there are currently eight municipalities                            that have the Transit Village designation throughout                            the state. The other municipalities are Morristown,                            Metuchen, Rutherford, South Amboy, South Orange, Riverside                            and Rahway.                                                        The                            Transit Village initiative seeks to provide much-needed                            congestion relief on New Jersey roadways through the                            promotion of public transit expansion and partnerships                            with the private sector. Municipalities designated as                            Transit Villages will be given priority consideration                            for funding and technical assistance by the participating                            agencies.

Each once had the same resources -- water, air, land and people -- but a quick glance reveals that each took different paths at the start of the 21st Century. In one region, the features that had once made it attractive are rapidly vanishing. The region's central core, which formerly prospered with an active downtown, strong manufacturing base and vibrant neighborhoods, is now experiencing disinvestment. Its residents, at least those who remain, are disproportionately poorer and older, and their neighborhoods are not being renewed with younger families and new or rehabilitated housing. The aging suburbs that circle the city have begun to experience similar patterns of disinvestment. However, the threat of blight and decline is even more ominous here, since these suburbs have fewer financial resources than the central city, due to a stagnant or nearly non-existent tax base and very few employment opportunities except modest wage service jobs. They are unable to cope with changed demands for services and the need to maintain streets, parks, sewers and the like. The region's outlying suburbs are located in what was once a productive agricultural belt or Sonoran desert landscape, with small independent towns of distinct and diverse qualities. But the agricultural and desert land is quickly disappearing; the small towns have merged into a characterless blur on the region's landscape with faceless, homogeneous strip shopping centers, convenience food restaurants and automobile dealerships. The region has reached a point where every place looks like every other place. The residents who had moved to these areas complain that the very attributes that had first drawn them to their communities are fading. Commuting delays grow longer and longer, and no matter how many fixes are made to freeways, nothing helps to ease the congestion. Families and friends have less time to spend together, and citizens have limited opportunities to participate in community life. Of course, a few communities in the outlying areas always seem to capture the prestigious office parks and regional shopping malls, and, consequently, they have lower property taxes and good public services. The rest, however, struggle to keep up with the demands of growth and financing shortfalls. Hoping to attract a large commercial or industrial development, they mortgage their future by offering tax incentives, utility hook-up waivers, low-cost or free land which they cannot afford to provide and zoning waivers that will destroy their landscape and community character. Service businesses in these outlying areas cannot entice employees because there is no affordable housing nearby and transportation from the central city and the inner-ring suburbs is infrequent, expensive and inconvenient. Schoolteachers and police officers in these communities complain that they cannot afford to live near  1   where they work. They face long, time-consuming trips by automobile across the region to reach their jobs. The natural environment is not much better. The air has taken on a biting, stinging quality. Asthma is on the rise. Development has been permitted in areas that periodically flood. The desert open spaces that had once been so prominent in the region and provided refuge for birds, reptiles and rare plants are being filled and developed. There has been talk about purchasing these lands for an open space system, but the elected officials in the region worry about the costs of acquisition and long-term maintenance, and the loss of property taxes from denying development, so the idea is shelved. In the second metropolitan region, there is a different story. The region's governments pride themselves on their willingness to cooperate with one another, plan for the general good and offer their citizens opportunities to participate collaboratively in civic life. The characteristics give the region an international reputation, and delegations from other states and even other countries regularly visit to learn from its successes. The planning for the region is animated by a strong set of commonly held values and a vision of where the region wants to be in 40 years. The central city and the inner-ring suburbs work together to prevent the area from slipping into decline. They continue to be vibrant communities, with bustling, diverse neighborhoods. They experience cycles of renewal and rebirth involving housing for all income levels, retail businesses and start-up companies. Because the region's leaders had agreed some years before on a regional land use framework and sharing tax revenue on a metropolitan basis, businesses have located in or adjacent to activity centers where people can get to them easily, and no local government feels pressured to chase economic development simply for tax revenue, or to accept a business at a site that is not optimal or on terms that are not in the public interest. This region has made every effort to link land use and transit. Mixed use activity centers combine middle- and high-density residential uses with employment and entertainment. Within neighborhoods, transit stations become focal points surrounded by neighborhood shopping and small office hubs. Transition of once declining neighborhoods and communities has come about because of reinvestment in the central city neighborhoods to improve parks, lower crime and increase transportation and mobility choice. A mix of local (approved by voters) and federal government funding has enabled the region to develop a regional transportation system integrated with land use and economic development policies. The region's leaders had the foresight to opt for a multi-modal transportation system that offers people many alternatives to automobiles, rather than just one or two. Mass transit, many believed, could be quicker, cheaper and safer than automobiles. An increasing number of people now  2   leave their cars parked at home or at transit stations within their communities. The transportation system is now linked together, and it is possible to cross the region rapidly, moving from train to bus without significant delay. The environmental consequence of reduced auto travel is that the air has become cleaner and commute travel times have been reduced. The region's leaders also initiated a long-range plan to purchase, in advance of development, environmentally significant parcels containing pristine Sonoran desert, drainage corridors and natural habitats. This series of greenways form a continuous recreational and open space link within the region. Bike paths have been constructed through and alongside the greenway system, and as a result, the greenways double as bicycle and pedestrian transportation corridors. Because the region has taken steps to direct development away from flood sensitive areas, its communities do not have to expend funds to clear up flood debris and repair public facilities. Growth has been carefully planned in the region to avoid pristine desert lands, which benefit from a comprehensive open space and resource preservation program that relieves the pressure to develop them. The villages in the region's outskirts remain freestanding and retain their distinctive Southwest rural character. The region's leaders have recognized an obligation to ensure that affordable housing is dispersed across the metropolitan area and are taking active measures to guarantee that an adequate supply is built and integrated into existing neighborhoods, as well as new master planned communities. Thus, teachers, police officers, bank and grocery clerks, waiters and waitresses and others with low- and moderate-wage jobs can live within reasonable distances of their employers. Which is our future?  3   KEY FINDINGS AND ISSUES  According to the Morrison Institute,1 the Phoenix Metropolitan Area does practice a limited form of ""smart growth"" management. No regional or state-level regime exerts strong management across the urban area, but many local governments employ an array of growth management approaches. For example, large desert tracts are being protected as open space within and near the urbanized area, downtown cores are undergoing revitalization, infill development incentives are in place in many of the larger cities and financial exactions are offsetting portions of the costs to cities for new development.  For the last 50 years, sprawl has been the dominant growth practice in the United States. In 1950, 84 million people lived in 168 U.S. metropolitan areas. Sixty percent (60%) of these lived within the ""central city."" By 1990, the demographic proportions of these 168 metro areas were reversed, with only one-third of their population of 159 million living in central cities.  The following are the indicators of sprawl in Phoenix Metropolitan Area. These indicators clearly suggests that there is a need to apply smart growth management tools in order to discourage sprawl:   Metropolitan Phoenix has a density of 4.2 people per acre or 2,707 people per square mile .1 From 1975 to 1995, Metropolitan Phoenix's urbanized area more than doubled. Forty percent (40%) of all agricultural land and 32% of undeveloped desert was lost.1 From 1970 to 1990, the population of the Phoenix Urbanized Area increased by 118%, while the number of miles driven in the area (""vehicle miles of travel"" or ""VMT"") increased by 257%. In the 1980s in Metropolitan Phoenix's urban areas, the number of VMT increased three times faster than the population. From 1995 to 2000, the urban edge has advanced nearly one-half mile per year, and three-fourths mile per year in the southeast. The region's heaviest homebuilding is now occurring in a ring some 18 to 21 miles from downtown Phoenix.        More and more, land development policy is written and talked about in the national news media. More people are aware of land use issues and want to get involved. The discussion of sprawl and growth is often divorced from reality.  4   Paradoxically, people hate both sprawl and density. The sprawl/density issue may ultimately be an issue of ""place differentiation"" and ""place separation."" The perception is that everything looks the same and feels the same. When leaving one's home, the view along the drive is less interesting and feels more urban. There needs to be a way to make density NOT a dirty word, and ""place-making"" is one method to make density acceptable. Neighborhood character and placemaking are frequently overlooked at the community planning scale. We need both ""sprawl"" and ""density"" to accommodate expected growth. Sprawl alone will result in the decay of the urban core. Density increases alone cannot accommodate growth.  Effecting regional change is a slow process that requires a long-range perspective and a long-term commitment, to make changes at three different scales: project scale, community or corridor scale and regional scale.  Project Scale changes to land use can happen every day as cities and counties review and approve development projects. To facilitate change, communities can start now to modify their codes and regulations to incorporate more aggressive standards into local land use decisions. Community or Corridor Scale changes to land use typically require a longer planning horizon (5 to 15 years). As a number of cities in Maricopa County plan for Light Rail Transit (LRT), which will include a Phase One system opening in 2006, they are planning at the community or corridor scale. Station area planning evaluates development, redevelopment, infill and preservation improvement opportunities within a one-fourth to one-half-mile radius around station location. In studying neighborhood pockets around transit stops, cities may want to modify their land use plans to take advantage of increased pedestrian activity and promote transit usage. Regional Scale changes to land use happen after extensive study and prioritysetting by various communities with regard to: urban form options, integrating these land use approaches with other regional planning (e.g., transportation, open space, affordable housing, economic development), and sorting out the implementation requirements (e.g., regional planning legislation, tax revenue sharing) to achieve desired outcomes. These efforts often take three to four years to complete (in terms of study and consensus-building), and decades to implement among various jurisdictions and regional agencies.       Compact urban form, with an emphasis on central city redevelopment, infill development and limited development on the fringe, will not work unless communities also address crime and security concerns, and the quality of schools and public facilities. It is important to maintain a strong middle-income family presence in inner-city neighborhoods and edge city suburban areas, and to attract  5   aging residents (e.g., empty nesters, retirees) back to the core as their lifestyle changes. Although compact urban form options (evaluated in the previous Maricopa Association of Governments [MAG] Urban Form Study) would not appreciably reduce traffic congestion or improve air quality, they would increase mobility choice, address affordable housing and community revitalization and improve overall quality of life with a variety of lifestyle choices in older urban areas and newly developing suburban areas. LRT in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area could help create higher urban density development and redevelopment along the rail transit routes, as well as within station influence areas. LRT offers potential for the revitalization of urban neighborhoods and the improvement of local and regional quality of life.  While the recently enacted ""Growing Smarter Plus"" legislation gives cities and counties new tools to address sprawl, including urban service limits and the potential to implement impact fees for the cost of new development, it still lacks mandatory regional oversight and inter-city coordination. To improve Growing Smarter Plus, the legislation should be changed to require regional approval of local general plans, through some form of regional planning oversight agency. This agency should help local governments by providing leadership on matters such as air quality, transit and economic development (including revenue sharing) that cross jurisdictional boundaries. If planning is not better coordinated, we will continue to implement land use policy by accident.  Entitled (already approved) development can accommodate over 500,000 new housing units, many of which are at the edge of the current urbanized area. Over 120,000 of these homes are in the City of Buckeye alone. The smaller rural communities experiencing phenomenal growth are not mature enough to adequately address growth issues. Many have only one planner and are struggling with ""Growing Smarter Plus"" and everyday development review pressures. They are not prepared to cope with the growth headed their way. These communities could benefit from regional leadership and initiatives to provide standardized code/ordinances that can help them address issues of infrastructure capacity, impact fees and design standards.  Our infrastructure is becoming increasingly overburdened. Capacity problems worsen when the region expands while continuing to use much of the old trunk infrastructure to access water supply, wastewater treatment and major storm drainage facilities. The original infrastructure was sized for lower levels of population, density and growth. More emphasis needs to be placed on upgrading existing infrastructure and developing alternative solutions (e.g., use of tertiary treated effluent for landscape irrigation).  Although the real estate market is probably not ready for pure New Urbanist or Transit Oriented Development, hybrid developments such as the DC Ranch and 6   Desert Ridge master planned communities contain a mix of traditional neighborhood character, good neighborhood planning, multi-modal circulation systems, extensive open space and interconnectedness that supports quality of life. They contain hybrid elements that can be accomplished and should be pursued elsewhere in both master planned communities and traditional neighborhoods. We expect to see an increasing number of hybrid development characteristics in such neighborhoods.  Maricopa County's urban land area doubled between 1975 and 1995, when 40% of all agricultural land and 32% of undeveloped desert was lost. Maricopa County is rapidly losing desert and agricultural areas to urban uses. The City of Phoenix estimates that State Trust land encompasses 70% of the undeveloped land on its north side. Large tracts of such trust land near the urban fringe constitute an irreplaceable asset for the region's quality of life. This land could serve as a natural growth boundary that provides a vast reservoir of open space. The vivid Sonoran Desert is what makes Metropolitan Phoenix unique and gives it a special character, including its status as a major tourist destination. Losing huge tracts of desert threatens the region with the loss of its best and most distinctive environmental assets. Major open spaces should be preserved within and at the edge of the metropolitan area.1  SMART GROWTH   National Findings: ""The seismic aftershocks of explosive growth have registered in the American hinterlands -- in distant wilderness preserves, wildlife refuges and parks; in deserts, prairies, forests and mountain ranges; and in the agricultural communities and rural horizons that once defined the American experience. The vast American countryside, the fountainhead of national myth, memory and identity, is beginning to lose its distinctiveness.""2  For many people, dissatisfaction goes beyond physical change in the landscape and the attendant costs. They are searching for roots, a sense of place, a sense of community. Their discontent may stem from economic uncertainties or reflect unease about the nature or pace of change generally. Their anxiety may be sparked by an influx of newcomers, incidents of street crime, traffic congestion or deteriorating schools. It must seem to some Americans that they have lost control of their communities. Many undoubtedly yearn to recapture from the past a seemingly simpler time, with tranquil suburbs or thriving, friendly urban neighborhoods.2 ""The nation need not be locked into the rising costs of extending public facilities or providing disaster relief because of inefficient land use patterns that do not respect natural forces, especially the flow of water. Rather than treating    7   land as an afterthought incidental to the quality of life, Americans should recognize that land stewardship -- promoting rational decision-making about the efficient use of land -- is central to realizing their desires for a strong economy, a healthy environment and livable cities. This concern cuts across political lines, uniting all Americans who care about the future of their country.""2  ""Smart growth"" seeks to accommodate population increases in ways that preserve the integrity of the community, protect the environment and enhance economic vitality. The goal of smart growth is not ""No Growth"" or even ""Slow Growth."" Rather, the goal is sensible growth that balances the need for jobs and economic development with the desire to save our natural environment and quality of life. Two scenarios described in the preface contrast environments in contemporary American life. In the first, the set of problems facing the metropolitan region is exacerbated by the local governments' inability to work toward shared goals and the lack of coordinated planning. In the second, while local governments maintain their independence, they cooperate with each other on matters of multi-jurisdictional importance, and the region's leadership is able to employ advance planning to systematically address the management of growth and change. Smart Growth principles Include:            Anticipating Growth and Planning Needs, Establishing a Long-term Comprehensive Plan with Adequate Land Supply, Compact Development, Protection of Natural Resources, Substantial Public Open Space, Infill Development, Variety of Housing, Mixed Use, Walkable Neighborhoods, Balanced Multimodal Transportation, Timely Provision and Fair Funding of Infrastructure, Reasonable, Predictable Plan Review, 8          Supporting Fiscal Policies, and Integration of Land Use, Transportation, Infrastructure and Public Facilities in all Planning Decisions.   Portland, Oregon; Atlanta, Georgia; and Lincoln, Nebraska, use Smart Growth principles to achieve quality of life, environmental and economic objectives in their metropolitan areas. Rancho Santa Margarita, California, a recent master planned community, has incorporated many of the important characteristics of smart growth: namely, a mix of land uses, open space preservation and various transportation options, resulting in a unique urban/suburban hybrid.  Smart Growth planning has produced techniques that include the following:      Establishment of an urban growth boundary to limit or slow sprawl and retain valued resource and open space areas, Clustering intense growth in areas near light rail stations and other mass transit facilities, Redevelopment of the downtown to give the region a coherent focus, An emphasis on infill construction in areas that are already developed and served by existing infrastructure, and Using design guidelines that emphasize new urbanism and pedestrianscale communities rather than automobile-based sprawl.3   Regional Findings: According to the Morrison Institute,1 the Phoenix Metropolitan Area does practice a limited form of growth management. No regional or state-level regime exerts strong management across the urban area, but many local governments employ an array of growth management approaches. For example, large tracts of desert are being protected as open space in and near the urbanized area, downtown cores are undergoing revitalization, infill development incentives are in place in many of the larger cities and financial exactions are offsetting portions of the costs to cities for new development.  Twenty-five cities and towns in the metropolitan area and Maricopa County were surveyed by the Morrison Institute to better understand the nature and level of local growth management efforts. The county and 18 cities/agencies responded that they use the following approaches to growth management:  Strategies to discourage sprawl and encourage compact urban development, infill and revitalization of blighted or troubled areas (7 of 19 respondents).  9     Requiring all infrastructure to be financially secured at the time of development by impact fees or adequate public facilities ordinances (15 of 19). Urban design requirements that aim at aesthetically pleasing urban areas, mixed uses and environmentally friendly places (14 of 19). Policies and programs to protect sensitive lands, rural areas and open space (8 of 19 respondents provide revenue for open space). Policies and programs to assure affordable housing as a major component of new development.       Eighteen less populous cities on the urban fringe now control nearly as much land as the City of Phoenix and the five largest suburbs combined. These urban fringe communities lag behind the rest of the region in open space protection and the use of growth management tools. However, East Valley fringe towns and cities wield more restrictive growth management tools than their counterparts in the West Valley. In the east, Apache Junction, Queen Creek, Mesa and Chandler use an average of five growth management tools. In the west, Glendale, Goodyear, Litchfield Park, Surprise and Peoria use an average of two tools. The municipalities in the region least equipped to deal with the effects of fast growth will soon be making decisions with enormous implications for the entire region. The challenge will be to bring a regional perspective to the planning efforts of all cities, while respecting the region's tradition of local control.1  During the last five years, the urban edge has advanced nearly one-half mile per year. In the southeast, the fringe moved out an average of three-fourths of a mile each year. The region's heaviest home building is now occurring in a ring 18 to 21 miles from downtown Phoenix. How far out will the ring of development need to be pushed to accommodate the 1.6 million additional residents projected for the region by 2020?  Growing Smarter Plus legislation only brings Arizona up to the 20th Century in land use and growth management, by mandating elements that have been required by other states for more than a decade. While Growing Smarter Plus gives cities and counties expanded tools to control sprawl, including urban service limits and the potential to implement impact fees for costs of new development, it lacks mandatory regional oversight and inter-city coordination that other successful growth management programs employ. Reforms to the local planning processes, including public involvement plans and limits on annexations, are positive additions. However, the requirement for voter ratification of general plans and plan amendments could change a technically crafted document to a public relations piece.  10   SUSTAINABLE USE OF LAND/SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  National Findings: The complex problems shared by cities throughout the United States are evidence of the impacts of urban sprawl -- increasing traffic congestion and commute times, air pollution, inefficient energy use, habitat loss, inequitable distribution of economic resources and the loss of a sense of community.  Community sustainability requires a transition from poorly managed sprawl to land use planning practices that create and maintain efficient infrastructure, ensure close-knit neighborhoods and preserve natural systems. Sustainable development provides a framework within which communities can use resources efficiently, create efficient infrastructure, protect and enhance quality of life and create new businesses to strengthen their economies. Sustainable development is a strategy by which communities seek economic development approaches that also benefit the local environment and quality of life.4     The way we plan the physical layout, or land use, of our communities is fundamental to sustainability. Two main features of our land use practices over the past several decades have converged to generate haphazard, inefficient and unsustainable urban sprawl:   Zoning ordinances that isolate employment, shopping and services and housing from each other, and Low density growth planning aimed at creating automobile access to increasing expanses of land.4   Communities practicing sustainable development include: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Chillicothe, Missouri; Hidden Springs, Idaho; and Seaside, Florida. A primary objective of Albuquerque's plan is to help create a sustainable future for the community and develop a sense of social and environmental stewardship.  Hidden Springs, Idaho, sustainable planning is based upon eight principles that aim to protect the natural environment, preserve rural character and farming traditions, preserve quality of life, increase diversity and achieve traditional design for neighborhoods and homes.   Regional Findings: Native Americans in the Valley of the Sun learned sustainability through centuries of survival. As European settlers moved in, the balance of sustainability was continually altered with urban conveniences (e.g., electricity, irrigation, railroads, wood-built structures, highways, shopping centers and airports). Sustainable living was lost, and the balance was eliminated between  11   the area's finite and delicate resources and the desire to change the living environment to suit the new population.  In an Arizona State University (ASU) study of sustainable development (funded by the Environmental Protection Agency),4 ASU found that 9,000 acres of land per year -- one acre per hour -- have been developed, resulting in loss of habitat, damage to riparian areas and communities with low levels of social well-being. The communities in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area are automobile-dependent, and houses are designed without regard to energy demand or use of environmentally responsible materials. Serious air quality problems have been attributed to sprawl and the rapid increase in vehicle miles of travel. While many communities have worked toward identifying principles of sustainable development, few have attempted to apply these principles to the design of a specific site.  Civano, a master planned community under development on the eastern fringe of Tucson, is attempting to return to more traditional building and living practices. Civano is an environmentally and pedestrian-friendly community dedicated to a lifestyle that fosters relationships among the social community, the environment and natural resources. Civano's name comes from a Native American word referring to sustainability.  The Civano community encompasses 1,145 acres and plans to build 2,600 homes in four neighborhoods combining places to live, work, learn, shop and play. Civano is a community that connects people to the environment while re-creating the kind of social action that was once a part of everyday life before privacy and cars became prominent. The Civano community puts the idea of socialization at the top and creates a framework where people feel that they belong. The Neighborhood Center, a microcosm of the community, has a group of public buildings and businesses designed to represent the technology of the entire community. As a demonstration of sustainable building techniques, offices, a caf, an art gallery, retail stores and a meeting hall are made of straw bale, RASTRA block (cement-coated recycled polyurethane foam blocks), wood frames, recycled materials, passive and active solar designs, thermal mass walls and energy-efficient windows with recycled wood frames and environmentally friendly glue. Goals of Civano are to significantly reduce water use, air pollution and solid waste, and to conserve energy with promotion of passive and active solar methods, as well as to provide affordable housing and good jobs. The goal of this development is to construct a new form of community that balances human needs with natural resources.    12     Phase One of Civano has attracted a diverse group of people of all ages and races. Residents have moved into more than 60 homes. The straw bale homes are admired by visitors but are difficult to mass-produce at a reasonable price. Most of the homebuyers therefore choose wood and steel frame construction. All the homes have designs that use optimal natural lighting and open spaces while promoting homeowner privacy.  HYBRID DEVELOPMENT  National Findings: What is the future of suburban development? Reid Ewing5 predicts that much suburban development over the next two decades will be a modified version of New Urbanist principles. Many new developments will incorporate enough New Urbanist design elements to alter the suburban landscape. Does the housing market break down into just two large groups: New Urbanist (neotraditional) and conventional? Some experts feel that market segmentation is far more complex, with multiple development models and various hybrids potentially appealing to different niches. Hybridization of land development -- the mix and match of ""green,"" conventional suburban, and neotraditional characteristics within a development -- is being implemented in the United States at four levels: communities, commercial centers, individual streets/neighborhoods and individual design elements.  In large master planned communities, hybridization occurs when one or more neotraditional neighborhoods are developed alongside conventional ones. The Woodlands outside Houston (a 1970s new town), whose older neighborhoods are completely conventional, recently opened its first neotraditional neighborhood. Lake Nona, a golf course community in Orlando, has made a wholesale switch from conventional development to a brand of neotraditional development in its later phases.5 Old shopping centers from Winter Park, Florida, to Lafayette, California, are being razed and replaced with pedestrian-oriented shopping streets. Some new shopping centers are being designed with two sides, one auto-oriented and one for pedestrians. Even discount and power centers are being redesigned at a human scale.5 At the neighborhood level, some conventional suburbs are incorporating traditional elements such as porches and public spaces. These changes reflect progress toward New Urbanism principles. Interestingly, there is movement in the opposite direction as well. Some New Urbanist developments are incorporating conventional design elements, such as cul-de-sacs or garages in front rather than off the back alley.      13     Individual design elements also offer opportunities for hybrids. Instead of mixing land uses and housing types at the block level, as in neotraditional towns, or rigidly separating them, as in conventional suburbs, New Urbanist developers are building small homogeneous clusters next to each other. Different housing types back up to each other across alleys or occupy adjacent blocks. Likewise, small commercial centers may substitute for corner stores that were a feature of the first generation of New Urbanist developments. While the single structures blended beautifully with townhouses and cottage homes, their scale worked against them. They could not compete with the shopping centers down the road. Village and town centers, however, are holding their own. Many other design elements are being hybridized as well. Street patterns are typical examples of how hybridization is implemented in neighborhoods. Instead of numerous street connections associated with traditional urban grids or, conversely, the few connections associated with curved suburban streets, many New Urbanist developments are now adopting hybrid street networks that minimize through traffic and improve connectivity. These new street patterns offer multiple routes to disperse traffic, shorten trips and facilitate access by emergency and service vehicles. An early example of neotraditional development is Laguna West (outside Sacramento), with its combined grid and cul-de-sac street network connecting to the town center. The street networks of Hidden Springs, Idaho, and Rivendell outside Sarasota, Florida, represent variations on this theme.     Regional Findings: Kierland Commons and Desert Ridge contain elements of new urbanism that serve as examples of community and commercial center hybridization.  With its pedestrian-friendly ""main street"" ambiance, open outdoor public spaces and a mix of upscale retail shops, restaurants and office space, Kierland Commons in northeast Phoenix leads a growing national trend in retailing. While ""lifestyle centers"" and big box power malls continue to proliferate, a new wave of urban village developments across the country is giving shoppers the best of all worlds: the convenience of an enclosed mall, a human-scale office environment and a somewhat nostalgic urban shopping experience. Desert Ridge encompasses approximately 5,800 acres and is bounded by Pinnacle Peak Road, the Central Arizona Project Canal, 64th Street and 32nd Street. Desert Ridge provides a strong mix use of residential, commercial and employment uses, along with an extensive pedestrian-friendly street network in a master planned setting that respects the natural drainage system. Desert Ridge is located adjacent to the Loop 101 freeway corridor and will contain a Village Core, which will include development of a mid- to high-density mixed 14     use core with a variety of commercial, employment, medical, entertainment, public and residential uses. The 110-acre Desert Ridge Market Place, the 950-room Marriott Resort (with 18-hole golf course), and 90+ acre American Express regional corporate office campus are currently under construction. These will complement the Mayo Hospital and Sumitomo microchip manufacturing plant. Desert Ridge will be one of the first master planned communities in the Phoenix area to develop a strong employment core, resulting in a relatively high jobs/housing ratio by 2020. The pedestrian system in Desert Ridge uses a naturally reconstructed wash corridor network, with extensive plant salvage and reuse, to provide linkages from all neighborhoods to the town center.  LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION CONNECTIONS  National Findings: In 1940, 15% of the population of the United States lived in suburbs, 32% in center cities and 52% in rural areas. By 1990, these percentages had drastically changed, with 47% in suburbs, 32% in center cities and 21% in rural areas. Suburb-to-suburb commuting in metropolitan areas accounted for approximately 15% of work trips in 1970 and 44% in 1990. It is getting harder to serve work trips with conventional transit because of multiple origins and destinations.  A national research project conducted for the Transit Cooperative Research Program expands and updates our knowledge of the effects of urban density on Light Rail Transit (LRT). This project analyzed information on 261 stations on 19 light rail lines in 11 cities, including Baltimore, Cleveland and St. Louis. The study shows that light rail, with its closely spaced stations, attracts more riders per station when it is located in denser residential areas. Feeder bus service also helps to boost light rail ridership.  The San Diego Trolley is seen as one of the most successful light rails systems in North America and a prototype for other cities. From an average daily ridership of 11,000 in the first year, the initial 15.9-mile South Line increased its ridership to more than 20,000 a day in less than five years.  Portland's success in devising and implementing strategies for land use and transportation planning have reversed the city's downtown decline, to make the city center a vibrant, growing and prospering core of the metropolitan area. Portland has achieved this through a commitment to transit, a willingness to innovate, a dedication to integrating land use and transportation planning and a participatory planning process that involves planners, political leaders and the public. In 1969, Portland's transit ridership was less than 18 million per year. By 1991, ridership had more than tripled to almost 58 million.  15    The most successful examples of transportation planning occur when land use and transportation decision-making are meshed. Transportation planning must be tied to regional growth and land use decisions, and must support economic development.  Regional Findings: The region faces complex transportation and land use decisions. Regional growth management is not capable of producing rapid change. If the most desirable land use and transportation plans were ready to implement tomorrow, we would not see significant changes in the urban form for at least a generation (20 or more years), because currently entitled development will accommodate more than a decade's worth of growth.  On October 1, 2000, the Arizona Republic published a special report on growth management issues and two upcoming ballot measures. A map in the article highlighted almost 60 large-scale planned unit development projects in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. These approved projects, when built out, will add over 500,000 units to the region's housing stock. Many of these projects are in cities at the edge of the current urbanized area, such as Buckeye.  The 500,000 units mentioned above represent approximately a 15-year supply of housing. Thus, effecting regional change will require a long-range perspective and a long-term commitment.  Why should we start changing land use and transportation now if we will see no significant difference for three decades or more? Actions initiated early allow for a better course and avoidance of future calamity. We can start now to affect urban form and land use on three different scales: project scale, community or corridor scale and regional scale.  Project scale changes to land use can happen every day as cities and counties review and approve development projects. To facilitate change, communities can start now to modify their codes and regulations to incorporate more aggressive standards into local land use decisions. Code modification should include change to development standards for (1) residential streets so that they support neighborhood circulator transit, and (2) commercial areas so that they support increased transit use. Local projectscale actions that can contribute to overall urban form changes include: encouraging mixed use developments and the establishment of mid- and high-density activity centers, reducing parking supply requirements, placing commercial building entrances along the street edge near transit, and making streets comfortable for walking. The latter can be accomplished by using parking and bike lanes to buffer pedestrians from traffic, and also by adding shade and pedestrian amenities. These principles can be applied to new development and also to infill and redevelopment opportunities. The consistent use of transit-friendly land use  16   principles during development review and approval will contribute to more responsible and efficient use of the land available for development or redevelopment.  Community or corridor scale changes to land use typically require a longer planning horizon (5 to 15 years). As Phoenix, Tempe and Mesa develop the Central Phoenix/East Valley LRT line, of which Phase One will open in 2006, they are planning at the community or corridor scale. The LRT project includes evaluation of land uses surrounding station areas. Station area planning evaluates development, redevelopment, infill, and preservation opportunities for a one-fourth-mile to one-half-mile radius around each station. Cities may choose to modify their land use plans to take advantage of increased pedestrian activity and promote transit use near stations. Modifying land use plans to support LRT facilitates achievable short-term changes, which may be incorporated into the community's General Plan updates (that are mandated by 2002). Regional scale changes to land use require studying and prioritizing various community or urban form options, integrating these land use approaches with other regional planning (e.g., transportation, open space, affordable housing, economic development), and then sorting out the implementation requirements to achieve the actions (e.g., regional planning legislation, tax revenue sharing). These efforts often take three to four years to complete (in terms of study and consensus-building), and decades to implement through cooperation between various jurisdictions and regional agencies. Ten years ago, MAG initiated a study to examine how the Valley's urban form could be shaped regionally to function as a positive and productive economic and social unit. The MAG Urban Form Study identified three considerations regarding the shaping of urban form in the Valley.  First, communities can work toward many significant improvements for shaping the region, including higher densities at the core and in targeted activity centers, implementation of a multimodal transportation system that provides mobility choices and establishment of regional revenue sharing to reduce the ""fiscalization"" of land use. However, entitled development will account for any near-term growth, preventing rapid change. Second, a compact urban form, with emphasis on central city redevelopment, infill development and limited development on the fringe, will not work unless the communities address crime and security concerns, as well as the quality of schools and public facilities in the inner city.        17     Third, the study found that although the more compact urban form options do not appreciably reduce traffic congestion or improve air quality, they increase mobility choice, stimulate affordable housing and community revitalization, and improve quality of life with a variety of lifestyle choices, both in the older revitalizing urban areas and in newly developing suburban areas.    In contrast to what has happened in other regions, Metro Phoenix's grid network and the lack of highway building in the 1960s to 1980s actually supported the region's central area. The present round of suburb-to-suburb freeway extensions is making jobs and homes away from the regional center more accessible, however. Thus, these freeways will intensify land consumption on the fringe. A key question for Metropolitan Phoenix is: should employment remain concentrated in the core while home building continues to move outward? Has the addition of other employment centers in Scottsdale, Mesa and Chandler improved the connection of housing and transportation? Are the freeways providing adequate suburb-to-suburb connections? The challenge will be finding transportation and land use initiatives that create dispersed, mixed use clusters of greater residential and employment density that do not detract from the vitality of downtown Phoenix, the Central Avenue office core and the airport employment area.   ""Transit village"" is a new paradigm for creating attractive and sustainable communities, both in the city and the suburbs, where rail or other high-capacity transit systems are or will be in place. America's transit village movement is in many ways a reaction to the perceived declining quality of life in cities and suburbs. The transit village concept brings together ideas from urban design, transportation and economics. It is about creating a built form that encourages people to ride transit more often. The transit village is an organizing principle for creating built, social and economic environments that embrace and evolve around mass transit systems. Traffic jams, faceless sprawl, and disconnected land uses are among the many reasons more Americans are embracing the transit village concept. The most important physical elements of the transit village include civic plazas near stations, pleasant walking environs, a mix of land uses, diversity in housing and compactness. Pleasant Hill, Hayward, and Mountain View are emerging transit villages in the San Francisco Bay Area. Ballston and Rosslyn, Virginia, and Bethesda, Maryland, are emerging transit villages in the Washington, DC, area. Orenco Station is a completely new transit village developed on a greenfield site on the Portland Westside LRT line near the City of Hillsboro.6  The planned LRT program is actually a comprehensive approach to improving mass transit that includes bus rapid transit (BRT), improved line-haul bus services on arterial roadways and feeder bus and neighborhood shuttles supporting rail 18   transit. Such a system is intended to encourage urban density along the rail corridor. LRT in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area could help create higher-density development and redevelopment along the rail transit routes and near stations, providing the first real planned connections between land use and transportation in the region. LRT's real success may be in its ability to economically revitalize city neighborhoods and improve quality of life in a way that would not be accomplished with land use changes alone.  DESERT PRESERVATION  Regional Findings: Maricopa County's urban land area doubled between 1975  and 1995. Forty percent (40%) of all agricultural land and 32% of undeveloped desert was lost.1  Maricopa County is rapidly losing desert and agricultural areas to urban uses. The vivid Sonoran Desert is what makes Metropolitan Phoenix unique and creates its appeal as a major tourist destination. Losing huge tracts of land threatens the region with the loss of its best and most distinctive environmental asset. State and federal lands are also affecting Metropolitan Phoenix's open space and desert landscape. The City of Phoenix estimates that State Trust land encompasses 70% of the undeveloped land on its north side. Large tracts of State-owned trust land near the urban fringe constitute an irreplaceable asset for the region's quality of life. This land could serve as a natural growth boundary that provides a vast reservoir of open space. However, the state constitution requires that these lands be managed to maximize revenues for Arizona's educational needs. The mandate bars wholesale conservation of the lands and increase the likelihood of future land sales to developers. The challenge for the region will be to finance the purchase of prime open space lands, or to amend the Arizona constitution and state Enabling Act to allow for trust land to be dedicated to open space while maintaining the ability to fund schools. The region already provides some examples of cooperatively planned desert open space preservation. In 1992, MAG, in conjunction with the Maricopa Department of Transportation (MCDOT) and the Flood Control District of Maricopa County (FCDMC), prepared the ""Desert Spaces Plan"" to serve as a guide for the protection of open space while allowing for future community growth and development. The MAG Regional Council adopted the Plan in 1995, with a recognition that Valley residents are quickly losing Sonoran vegetation, mountain access and views and riparian areas that define the character of the Valley and are important to the desert lifestyle. The Desert Spaces Plan is      19   intended to preserve, protect and enhance the mountains, foothills, rivers, washes, canals, cultural sites, upland desert vegetation and wildlife habitat of the area. The plan assesses existing conditions and presents a future vision that stresses the importance of timely and thorough coordination among local municipalities, public agencies, interest groups and residents.  The Sonoran Desert Preservation and Comprehensive Land Use Plan, prepared by Pima County in the Tucson Metropolitan Area, represents a new and dynamic vision for accommodating population expansion and economic growth, while preserving and protecting regional natural resources. It provides the foundation for developing growth management plans. The Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan combines short-term actions to protect and enhance the natural environment with long-range planning to ensure that the natural and urban environments not only coexist, but also develop an interdependent relationship where one enhances the other. Implementing this plan will require continuous cooperation between governments, interest groups and citizens over the next 20 years. The action plan will also guide already approved public bond investment and conservation/preservation actions, establish federal program and funding priorities, and formalize the Tucson region's preference for the expenditure of state funds to preserve and protect State Trust lands threatened by urbanization. The Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan contains the following six elements: (1) ranch conservation, (2) historic and cultural preservation, (3) riparian restoration, (4) mountain parks, (5) habitat, biological and ecological corridor conservation, and (6) critical and sensitive habitat preservation.  PLANNING AND LAND USE REFORM  National Findings: The effort to offer legislative solutions to manage growth and change is not new. In the 1920s, as American urban areas underwent a surge of growth, urban experts and federal officials focused their attention on creating enabling legislation for planning and land use controls. It was believed that, if urban areas had the proper grant of power from their state legislatures, they could create tools to grapple with the social and environmental stresses that afflicted the growing cities. The realization that new powers were needed to cope with growth and change did not occur overnight. States and local governments had been experimenting with various types of planning legislation since 1910.7  When the early enabling legislation was drafted, growth was largely confined to central cities and the few suburbs that had commuter rail or streetcar lines. While control of air and water pollution, noise and industrial hazards was always a factor in urban areas and prompted the adoption of many early land use regulations, appreciation of the complex interactions of ecological  20   systems -- and the human impact on those systems -- was still in its infancy. After World War II, the vast changes in the shape and complexity of metropolitan areas tested the planning and zoning structure that enabling legislation provided. Prior to the automotive era, development had spread out along public transit lines that brought workers into the central areas during the day. With the advent of the automotive era, development began to fill in vast open spaces between these transportation spokes. Growth shifted outward from the central city to rural areas in ways that would have profound effects on the form and function of cities and towns. The political and social climate of the period supported financial incentives for building homes in the suburbs (through federally insured low-cost mortgages) and a massive federally subsidized expansion of highways that included the interstate highway system. Together they helped push development far beyond the nation's central cities.  At first, Americans tended to fantasize about an idyllic existence in these newly developed suburban communities. The new communities had unquestionable attractions -- large yards, garages, new schools, safe streets and a frontier-like sense of promise. Relatively few people seriously challenged this new pattern of growth in the outlying areas or questioned the changes in the central cities wrought by ""urban renewal"" and the replacement of older urban neighborhoods with multi-lane freeways. While a few cities responded by experimenting with metropolitan or regional forms of government, in most metropolitan areas such ideas got a cool reception. In metropolitan areas with characteristics similar to the one described in the first scenario at the beginning of this paper -- and there are many of them -- there is a growing appreciation that something is wrong with the way things have turned out. Some persist in believing that the solution to the problems of metropolitan growth, decline and change is to continue to expand outward to the next tier of open land, striving to remain one jump ahead. But more and more people are acknowledging the social, economic and environmental costs of pushing ever outward, and the need for more effective planning to respond to changing needs of a region's population. They are asking whether there are better, more action-oriented planning models that are attuned to the realities of today and tomorrow.     Current planning approaches to enabling legislation in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area are incapable of meeting the challenges of the 21st Century. The American Planning Association cites four reasons for this deficiency:  A more significant intergovernmental dimension for planning. The Phoenix Metropolitan Area used to have a simpler government structure with fewer governmental units. Planning was a local activity, not something that was expected of all levels of government. Indeed, the role of the federal and state 21   government in shaping our urban and rural areas was non-existent. Beginning in the 1950s, the federal government created programs addressing transportation, the environment and other areas that had statewide or regional significance. Increasingly, the federal government placed greater responsibility on state and local governments for making transportation, environmental and other planning decisions when federal monies were involved.  A shifting view of land. People in Arizona are beginning to believe that land is more than a commercial commodity. The land is now regarded as a resource. Vacant, developable land is recognized as having competing social values. It can be used for the construction of affordable housing or for the continuation of agriculture. How we develop our land -- at what density or intensity -- will have consequences for the form and relative compactness of metropolitan areas, which in turn will affect how much we have to travel and the consequences for the air we breathe. A more active citizenry. Until recently with Growing Smarter Plus, planning statutes were silent on the tools and techniques of participation in Arizona. Citizens now expect to be engaged in community planning processes, and, when they participate, they expect to see results from their efforts. The existence of the Internet, on which plans and information about developments can be placed as part of a government's home page, opens new options for citizen involvement. A more challenging legal environment. Land use controls are being employed to solve or prevent environmental problems, maintain open space and exact fees for public facility improvements (e.g., schools, water and sewer systems, roads, libraries, fire and police stations). The line between protecting the public from nuisances -- the focus of early enabling legislation -- and securing public benefits has blurred. In response, courts have begun to require government to compensate landowners for regulations that result in either a permanent or temporary taking of private property, that push the envelope ""too far"" in protecting the public health, safety and welfare -- the traditional police power objectives of land use controls. Thus, the planning basis for our development decisions becomes even more significant as the justification for the regulatory and public expenditure systems it supports.      22   ABBREVIATIONS ASU BRT FCDMC LRT MAG MCDOT VMT Arizona State University Bus Rapid Transit Flood Control District of Maricopa County Light Rail Transit Maricopa Association of Governments Maricopa County Department of Transportation Vehicle Miles of Travel  23   REFERENCES Morrison Institute for Public Policy.

As a result, Maryland is well on its way to meeting the Chesapeake Bay Agreement's goal of preserving 20% of the State's Bay watershed. While no single program provides this protection, several state agencies, working through a web of statutes, regulations, and policies, have successfully implemented the most effective conservation efforts in the United States. While Maryland continues to lead in the area of land conservation, Governor Robert L. Ehrlich, Jr. has identified new administrative policies to enhance these very successful programs. Accordingly, Maryland will focus all land conservation programs on the Bay, outdoor recreational facilities, and land base for agricultural and forestry industries, which will enable the State to maximize its land conservation investment. This focus will maximize conservation efforts and support a significant economic base throughout the state. Recreation lands, open space, rural and historic landscapes, and the agricultural and forest lands conserved by these programs are integral to the State's tourism and agricultural and natural resource-based industries that in turn are important factors in Maryland's economic well-being. Finally, new efforts to coordinate this focus among the agencies will provide policy makers and the State's local partners greater financial stability. The following land preservation goals were established by the 2000 Chesapeake Bay Agreement and by the General Assembly: Chesapeake Bay Agreement (CBA): Permanently preserve 20% of the Bay watershed by 2010 =  Applied to the total state land area (93.8% of the State is in the Bay watershed)  Total protected land July 2003 (19.13%)  Additional Protection needed to meet CBA goal (0.96%)  Additional protection needed per year to meet CBA goal 1,241,605 acres 6,208,025 acres 1,187,849 acres 53,756 acres 7,680 acres al acres acres acres acres  Senate Joint Resolution 10, 2002, Prime Agricultural Land: Protect three times more farmland than was protected in April 2002 by MALPF, Rural Legacy, GreenPrint and Loc Purchase or Transfer of Development Rights by 2022 = 1,030,000  Acres protected by MALPF, RLP, GP & Counties as of FY 2003 393,552  Remaining Goal by 2022 636,448  Additional prime agricultural acres needed per year by 2022 33,497  Governor Ehrlich has directed state agencies to meet existing state land preservation goals of the 2000 Chesapeake Bay Agreement and the prime agricultural land preservation goals of SJ10. This will be achieved through new policies to focus all state preservation investment on resource lands. The essence of this new policy is to ensure that all conservation funding be utilized to maximize a positive impact on the Bay's watershed and water quality. The administration will:  1     Focus state land conservation programs on the most strategic lands to protect the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries as well as the most significant natural and agricultural resources; Apply the best scientific information and technology to identify resource lands that are most important, the potential threats to these lands, and areas in which preservation goals can be maximized; and Establish a process for collaboration and coordination among state and local land conservation programs to identify geographic and natural resource areas. A COORDINATED AND FOCUSED APPROACH TO LAND CONSERVATION      The following outline identifies principles to guide and focus the implementation of the State's land conservation programs on preserving the Bay. Focus State Land Conservation Priorities and Investments All state land conservation programs will identify the most critical areas for conservation and focus on permanently preserving Maryland's most important land resources. These areas include lands impacting the water quality and natural habitat of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, the State's most important resource-based industries, lands necessary to the State's resource-based industries, and lands necessary to foster tourism, recreation, and Maryland's natural environment. State agencies also will focus stewardship and restoration programs on areas where the State has made significant investments in land conservation. Easement acquisition guidelines will be developed in consultation with local governing bodies to identify the best agricultural and forestry lands of the State. Properties identified by the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture as high priorities will be considered favorable conservation investments. Use Best Available Information and Technology The State will use the best available mapping, data and geographic information systems to identify the most important parcels of land based on ecological and economic value, contribution to Chesapeake Bay restoration, and vulnerability to land use changes. The Department of Natural Resources' Green Infrastructure and Strategic Forest Lands Assessments are two tools that will be used, in conjunction with other available data, to help determine state land conservation focus areas for the DNR. The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation will incorporate mapping and geographic information systems capabilities to implement new ranking guidelines in cooperation with local partners. The Department of Planning's Master Parcel Database identify and map land most vulnerable to development or land use changes that would have a negative impact on the State's conservation efforts. Emphasize Cooperation and Collaboration The State will establish a process for collaboration and coordination among state and local land conservation programs, in cooperation with local governments, landowners, and private conservation groups, to identify geographic and natural resource areas. Each program's conservation strengths and legislatively mandated activities will be directed toward accomplishing the State's overall land protection goals.  2   IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVES Focus State Acquisitions  The State will use DNR's Green Infrastructure and Strategic Forest Lands Assessments to prioritize land conservation. This will prioritize watersheds according to their impact on the Bay and the ecological values of forestry lands. Protecting lands in both categories enhances efforts to protect the Bay because each category of land directly impacts the Bay's water quality (See Attachment 2). This prioritization will be applied to land and easement purchases. The State will establish a coordinated, proactive approach to identify, prioritize and act on key land preservation opportunities through federal, state and local land conservation programs. The administration will evaluate funding needs to meet agricultural land preservation goals and identify the prime agricultural and forestry lands of the State. The administration will work with the General Assembly, the Departments of Agriculture, Planning and Natural Resources, Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF), the appointed MALPF Task Force, and agricultural and forestry groups throughout these important decisions. State land purchases will be prioritized and coordinated with other Bay restoration efforts. Emphasis will be given to acquiring private in-holdings within existing DNR land units to alleviate management problems, provide public access, and protect natural resources. The General Assembly passed Senate Bill 564 in 2003 commissioning MALPF to develop easement acquisition guidelines in consultation with local governing bodies. MALPF will work with the Department of Planning and the Natural Resource Conservation Service (of USDA) to develop these guidelines working with local jurisdictions. The Governor will establish a land conservation work group of staff from the state's land conservation programs to provide a coordinated approach to land conservation with a focus on the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The State will use the 2005-2006 Land Preservation and Recreation Planning Process initiated by the Department of Planning to coordinate land conservation plans among state and local governments' land conservation programs. The State will coordinate federal land conservation programs to protect riparian buffers along the Bay and its tributaries. Further, the State will work to increase the flexibility of federal land conservation programs to ensure these programs contribute to protecting water quality and habitat in the Bay watershed. Consistent with legal sufficiency, the State will reduce the time delay and uncertainty in the State acquisition process by reducing the number of approvals of each transaction. This will alleviate the burden and frustration for landowners willing to protect their land. The State will identify potential revenue sources for land preservation, including: 3          Improve the Process for Implementing State Programs         Enhance Funding for Land Conservation Programs    a. Seeking a return to using 100% of real estate transfer tax revenues for funding land conservation and park improvements when the State's fiscal condition improves, as provided by Section 13-209 of the Tax-Property Article of the Maryland Code; b. Acquiring land with installment purchases whenever possible, by allowing a certain portion of the agricultural or real estate transfer taxes to be used for the acquisition of zero coupon bonds and debt service for Installment Purchase Agreements in order to leverage limited state special funds with federal bonds and provide tax benefits to participating landowners; c. Collaborating with other states that are signatories of the 2000 Bay Agreement to more effectively secure new sources of federal or private funding for land conservation; d. Enhancing state and local tax incentives for land conservation, including private donations of land and conservation easements. The State will evaluate, and where feasible, incorporate the tax incentives outlined in the report on taxes prepared for the Chesapeake Bay Program; and e. Increasing the marketing of conservation easements. PROGRAM GOALS FOR LAND CONSERVATION  SUMMARY Background As individual state land conservation programs were established, starting in 1967 with the Maryland Environmental Trust, each program was given a general purpose, but was not given quantified goals and timelines. More specific ""concept goals"" were established by the implementing agencies after Program Open Space was established in 1969, such as ""to protect open space at a rate that keeps pace with the rate that land is developed."" Quantified goals were not set until 2000 when the signatories to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement (Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and the federal Environmental Protection Agency) established a goal to permanently protect from development 20% of the land within the Bay watershed by the year 2010. These goals generally overlap with statewide goals described on page 1. For example, the recent goals for the Chesapeake Bay Agreement and for preserving prime agricultural land overlap, and these contribute to the POS general goal of preserving land at a rate that keeps pace with development. Continuing to preserve land through POS, the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF), the Rural Legacy Program (RLP), the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), Maryland Environmental Trust (MET), or federal or local land preservation programs is essential to meeting these statewide goals. The following is an outline of the state program goals for land conservation and the status of what the State and these programs have accomplished by the end of FY 2003.  4   PROGRAM GOALS AND STATUS See table page 6 Program Open Space:  Goal  acquire land necessary to conserve strategic natural resources while providing recreational and economic opportunities  keep pace with development.

In 1970 the General Assembly dedicated  of 1% real estate transfer tax to fund Program Open Space. This funding concept was based on the principles that the rate of funding for state land acquisition and local parks should keep pace with the rate that land is developed and when someone buys his house he also contributes to the open space and recreational assets of their community. All POS transfer tax revenues were initially divided 50%-50%, with half of the funds distributed to the 23 counties and Baltimore City by an allocation formula (based on population, growth rate of the county and the amount of transfer tax collected from each local jurisdiction) and the other half distributed to POS to state land acquisition. As the income from the transfer tax grew, especially in the late 1970s and 1980s when real estate activity and home prices increased, the General Assembly put annual ""caps"" on the revenue to POS. Beginning in 1980, tax revenue over this cap was diverted to the General Fund. Between FY1980 and FY2003, about $761.8 million in transfer tax revenues were diverted to the General Fund, which is about 41.3% of all transfer taxes collected since 1970. These funds were partially replaced during this period by $216.5 million in bond authorizations for POS and other land conservation programs using the transfer tax. For each of the past six years, POS has conserved land at a rate equal to or greater than the rate land was developed. Between 1998 and 2003, when an average of 14,618 acres of land per year was developed, POS protected an average of 16,816 acres. Between FY2002 and FY2004, $216.8 million in transfer taxes have been diverted to the General Fund and replaced by $102.8 million in bonds. This resulted in a net loss of $114 million to land conservation programs over this three-year period. While the transfer tax was diverted to the General Fund, the General Assembly also permitted several other uses of POS funds. A share of the local POS funds was used for park capital improvements. In 1977 the MALPF program began receiving a share of transfer tax revenues. In 1985 a 2% set-aside was provided for the Heritage Conservation Fund to acquire threatened or endangered species habitat. In 1990 the Departments of General Services, Planning, and Natural Resources were allowed to use 3% of the transfer tax for administration. DNR was allowed 25% of its state share of the transfer tax for capital improvement and critical maintenance projects, replacing prior general obligation bond funds. In 1997 the Heritage Area Finance Authority began receiving $1 million per year, and the Rural Legacy Program was authorized to use a share of DNR's transfer tax, in addition to authorized bond funds. As a result, the DNR's share of transfer tax revenues for land acquisition declined from 50% in FY1970 to 14.8% in FY2003. MALPF's share has increased from $2 million, or 7.14%, in FY1979 to 17.05% in FY2003. Accomplishments From 1970 to the end of FY2003, POS has funded the acquisition of 233,533 acres of land in fee simple and protected 17,186 acres with purchased easements, including those funded in part with federal programs described below. Local governments have acquired 7   36,388 acres with POS assistance, contributing to a total of 287,107 acres of preserved land. Most citizens in Maryland now have access to a park or protected open space within 15 minutes of their home as a result of POS funding.

In addition, a significant portion of the land protected by both stateside and local POS funds has been along the streams and tributaries feeding into the Chesapeake Bay. For many years, POS stateside funds were earmarked for Bay access and for specific streams and tributaries of the Bay, such as: Patapsco, Patuxent, Susquehanna, Deer Creek, Monocacy, Pocomoke, and Severn. Most of the State's acquisitions through POS have been fee simple interests in natural resource lands, protecting Maryland's rich ecological resources and preserving vegetation that filters the runoff of water into the streams, rivers and the Bay. The 287,107  8   acres of land protected by POS contributes significantly to meeting the Bay Agreement's goal to preserve 20% of the Bay watershed by 2010. Rural Legacy Program The General Assembly established the Rural Legacy Program (RLP) in 1997 to protect areas of large, contiguous blocks of land of rural landscapes, including agricultural, natural, cultural, and forestry resources. The program is a community-up process where local governments, private land trusts, farming, forestry, historic preservation, and other interest groups work together with landowners to achieve common land preservation goals in focused Rural Legacy Areas (RLAs). These areas must meet legislatively designated criteria, which includes the agricultural significance; forestry and natural resources aspects of the land; potential to protect large blocks of contiguous land (including greenways and wildlife corridors); value of resource-based industries and degree of threat to the resources. Local governments and land trusts (sponsors), in consultation with landowners, nominate RLAs that represent important rural working landscapes and significant natural resources. Sponsors prepare a long-term plan for protection of the area, including funding alternatives in addition to state funds, and apply to the Rural Legacy Board for area designation and grant funding. The Rural Legacy Board, composed of the Secretaries of Natural Resources, Agriculture and Planning, working with a Governor-appointed Advisory Committee representing a variety of interests in land use, recommends the designation RLAs and the distribution of the annual appropriations. The Board of Public Works approves the designation of all Rural Legacy Areas and grant funding. While some acquisitions are in fee simple, a majority of land conservation is by perpetual easement. RLP Funding The RLP is funded with a combination of general obligation bonds and a share of the state's allocation of Program Open Space real estate transfer tax revenues. Since the program was enacted, the Rural Legacy Board and the Maryland Board of Public Works have approved $132.9 million in grants to 25 Rural Legacy Areas. Twenty-one of Maryland's 23 counties are participating in the program. RURAL LEGACY FUND APPROPRIATIONS FISCAL YEAR 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 TOTAL TRANS.

Per acre costs for conservation easements have averaged about $2,600.  9   How RLP Protects the Chesapeake Bay Most of the 25 Rural Legacy Areas are located directly on the Bay or the shores of a major tributary of the Bay. RLP is a targeted and focused land conservation program designed to protect large, contiguous blocks of land to conserve the State's significant natural resources and sustain resource-based industries. This conservation is achieved through perpetual conservation easements of riparian buffers, protection of wetlands, best management practices through soil and water quality plans, and conservation of agricultural, forestry and natural resources. The 40,129 acres of land protected by the RLP contribute significantly to meeting the Bay Agreement's goal to preserve 20% of the Bay watershed by 2010. GreenPrint Program In 2001 the General Assembly enacted a new program designed to protect lands critical to the long-term ecological health of the State. These lands, referred to as Maryland's Green Infrastructure, provide the natural foundation to support a diverse plant and animal population and facilitate natural processes like filtering water and cleaning the air. DNR identified over two million acres of Green Infrastructure lands, 529,771 acres of which are now protected. The program was expected to boost the State's land conservation capacity by about 10,000 acres per year for five years. GreenPrint Funding In FY 2002 the GreenPrint Program received a first year bond authorization of $35 million, 75% ($26,250,000) distributed to DNR and 25% ($8,750,000) to MALPF. This was later reduced by $5,000,000, which adjusted the total distribution to $22,500,000 to DNR and $7,500,000 to MALPF. In FY 2003 this authorization was limited to $16 million, with $12 million to DNR and $4 million to MALPF. In FY 2004 the program was limited to $3 million, with $2,250,000 for DNR and $750,000 for MALPF. Accomplishments At the end of only two fiscal years, DNR's GreenPrint Program protected 10 highly significant groups of properties totaling 21,146 acres of Maryland's most important natural resources. The MALPF Program also protected 8,625 acres of agricultural preservation on lands ranked very high for their Green Infrastructure values. A total of 29,771 acres was protected at an average cost of $1,542 per acre. How GreenPrint Protects the Chesapeake Bay With the exception of some forested lands in Garrett and Allegany Counties in Western Maryland that flow into the Ohio River, almost all of the 2 million acres of Green Infrastructure lands are in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. These lands are the most ecologically significant of all lands in the watershed and their protection will maintain Bay water quality and wildlife habitat. Of the 21,146 acres of land protected by the DNR portion of GreenPrint to date, much of it is directly on the Bay or on one of its major tributaries. Of the 23,000 acre Glatfelter group of properties located in six counties on the Eastern Shore and Southern Maryland, 17,000 acres of easements were acquired with GreenPrint funds. Much of this forested land is on tributaries and streams leading into the Bay, the Potomac River, or the Coastal Bays. These forestlands will be managed under a Forest Management Plan incorporated into the easement held by DNR.  10   The Maryland Environmental Trust Founded in 1967 as an quasi-independent agency of DNR, the General Assembly established the Maryland Environmental Trust (MET) to ""conserve, improve, stimulate, and perpetuate the aesthetic, natural, health and welfare, scenic, and cultural qualities of the environment, including but not limited to land, water, air, wildlife, scenic qualities, open spaces, buildings or any interests therein..."" Since the 1970s MET accomplished this mission primarily through the solicitation and management of donated conservation easements, which are donated by private landowners. The federal government and Maryland have enacted a number of financial incentives to encourage landowners to permanently protect their land. The appraised value of easements donated to MET, directly or jointly associated with any of the over 50 local land trusts (non-profit conservation organizations) in Maryland, is deductible from the donor's annual income tax over a sixyear period. The General Assembly also enacted a 15-year property tax credit for the unimproved portions of property subject to an easement donated to MET, and more recently enacted an income tax credit of up to $5,000 per year or a total of $80,000 for donors of conservation easements to MET. In addition, federal and state estate taxes can be reduced substantially for heirs of easement donors because a donated conservation easement tends to reduce the value of the protected land as a part of the overall estate. While typical costs for easements purchased by MALPF or RLP range from about $2,000 to $2,700 per acre, easements donated to the MET cost the State only about $158 per acre for administration and enforcement. Accomplishments At the end of FY 2003, MET had protected 76,230 acres of land with donated conservation easements and held a total of more than 100,000 acres of easements, including those donated and others purchased by DNR through POS, RLP, and federal transportation enhancement. How MET Protects the Chesapeake Bay By permanently protecting more than 100,000 acres of land, MET contributes significantly to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement's goal to protect 20% of the Bay watershed by 2010. Through its Land Trust Assistance Program, MET also has helped form over 40 local land trusts and assisted these non-profit land conservation organizations with administrative grants, training, and revolving loan funds (Land Trust Grant Fund) to acquire easements or fee interests in land throughout the State. The Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) This easement program is part of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the United States Department of Agriculture and Maryland. The focus of the MOA is to protect water quality by removing marginal agricultural land from production and replacing it with best management practices including riparian buffers, stabilization of highly erodible soils, and restoration of wetlands. There is a two-tier system to accomplish these water quality improvements. First, the landowner enters into a 15-year lease contract (CREP contract) to take land out of production and to install best management practices for water quality. For some of that land, a second step involves permanently protecting the land taken out of production and the best management practices on it by selling a permanent conservation easement.  11   Land trusts or Soil Conservation District (SCD) offices acquire the easements from interested landowners who voluntarily agree to sell conservation easements. The Board of Public Works approves the MOA, easement program, and county acreage values paid for the easements. The completed recorded easements are held either jointly by DNR and the land trust or SCD, or solely by DNR. Under the MOA, the USDA is committed to entering into CREP contracts on 100,000 acres of land in Maryland. The State is committed to working to preserve the CREP areas on 25,000 acres by permanent easement. Maryland's original MOA with USDA ended December 31, 2002. The State is currently operating under a one-year extension and has submitted a proposal to USDA to renew the CREP contract through 2007. CREP Program Funding The CREP easement program is funded from POS transfer tax funds. Since the program was enacted, the Maryland Board of Public Works has approved $7.5 million of CREP projects. Currently, thirteen of Maryland's 23 counties are participating in the CREP program. CREP FUND APPROPRIATIONS FISCAL YEAR FUNDING 2001 $2,500,000 2002 $2,500,000 2003 $2,500,000 TOTAL $7,500,000 CREP Accomplishments By the end of FY 2003, $4.6 million in POS funds were expended to protect 55 CREP easements on 3,875 acres of land. This step toward water quality improvement includes 3,396 of forested land, 276 acres of vegetation, and 203 acres of wetlands. The mid-range price per acre CREP pays statewide is $3,600. Additionally, 1,058 acres of CREP buffers were protected through the Rural Legacy Program. Together, the two programs have protected 4,933 acres toward the State's goal of preserving 25,000 acres of CREP buffers. Maryland landowners have received a total of about $37.5 million in federal rental payments for establishing vegetative buffers on their properties. How CREP Protects the Chesapeake Bay The lands conserved by CREP are located directly on the Bay or the shores of the Bay's tributaries. CREP protects the Chesapeake Bay by helping to reduce the occurrences of runoff, nutrients, and sediment into the Bay and promoting enhanced wildlife habitats. The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) Established by the General Assembly in 1977 to preserve productive farmland and woodland for the continued production of food and fiber for all citizens of the State, MALPF also curbs the expansion of random urban development, protects wildlife habitat, and enhances the environmental quality of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. A 12member Board of Trustees and a staff of five administer the program. MALPF is based on a partnership with local governments, which appoint local land preservation advisory 12   boards of five members to assist MALPF administer the easement selection process in each county. To qualify for MALPF, landowners must first enroll their property into an agricultural preservation district restricting its development for a minimum of five years. If the property qualifies based on size and soil characteristics, landowners apply to the local land preservation advisory board, which reviews and approves applications to be forwarded to MALPF. The application process is competitive, with each county choosing its own ranking procedure, and each application ultimately being approved or denied MALPF's Board of Trustees. Easement values are based on an appraisal of the fair market value of the property and a statutory formula that determines its after-easement agricultural value. The difference between these two values is the easement value  the maximum that a landowner can be paid for an easement. Landowners often discount their asking price below this easement value to be more competitive in those counties that use discounting as a part of their ranking systems. Other counties give criteria such as size of the farm, proximity to other protected land, and quality of the farm operation more importance than the price offered by the applicant. The second round of offers is considered solely on discounts. New legislation will reduce the reliance on discounting to prioritize easement applications while increasing the importance of the quality of the farming property and the property to local land-use objectives. MALPF Funding MALPF receives funds from several sources, including 17.05% of the transfer tax, agricultural transfer tax, state general obligation bond funds, local government funds for the 60%-40% matching funds allocation, local government funds for 100% county-funded offers, GreenPrint funds, and Federal Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program (FRPP) funds. Typically, the largest share of funds is received from the state transfer tax through POS. Under the current allocation formula in the law, MALPF received $19,501,723 of transfer taxes in FY 2002. In FY 2003 these transfer tax revenues were substantially replaced with bond funds. In addition, funds are received from a portion of the agricultural transfer tax, which is levied on the buyers and sellers of farmland converted from specially assessed agricultural use to non-agricultural use. These landowners have enjoyed very low property tax assessments, which encourage them to continue productive agriculture or forestry, and pay 3% or 5% of the sale of the farm when it is converted for non-farm use. MALPF receives two-thirds of this tax, while one-third is retained by the local jurisdiction for land preservation purposes. If the county has a certified local land preservation program, it is allowed to keep 75% of the locally collected agricultural transfer tax, and MALPF receives the remaining 25%. In FY 2003 and FY 2004, MALPF received $1,500,000 for its capital and operating budgets from this source, which usually averages $3,000,000 per year. Many counties also provide funds to help acquire easements, either from their share of the agricultural transfer tax or from other county funds. In this way, some counties are able to increase their share of the overall state funding on a 40% local, 60% state matching basis or fund additional offers with 100% local funds. Local matching funds received in FY2002 were $7,620,515. As discussed above, MALPF has received 25% of GreenPrint funding to acquire MALPF easements located wholly or partially in the Green  13   Infrastructure. MALPF received $7.5 million in FY2002, $4 million in FY2003, and $750,000 in FY2004 from GreenPrint bond funds. M ALPF STATE REVENUE SOURCES FY2002-FY2004* Fund Source Real Estate Transfer Tax Ag.

During MALPF's 25 years of existence more than 3,062 properties totaling about 400,000 acres have enrolled in Agricultural Preservation Districts, and over half (about 1,600) of these have sold easements to the MALPF. Because many landowners offering to sell easements to the MALPF discount their asking prices substantially, MALPF has purchased easements at a savings from the calculated easement value. At the end of FY 2002, the accumulated value of this discount to the State totaled almost $102 million. MALPF currently is developing and implementing new rankings guidelines to better attract the best farming properties into the program, build on the past accomplishments of MALPF and other preservation programs, and preserve large contiguous blocks of properties that ensure longterm sustainable agricultural production. A number of counties have built on their experience in partnership with MALPF to develop complementary county agricultural land preservation programs. Local preservation programs have protected over 100,000  14   additional acres, contributing significantly to the protection of Maryland's agricultural resource base. (See ""Contributions of Local Land Conservation Programs"" below.) How MALPF protects the Chesapeake Bay By permanently protecting 228,854 acres of farm and forest land, 98% of which is located in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, MALPF is the second largest contributor, after POS, to achieving the Chesapeake Bay Agreement's goal of protecting 20% of the Bay watershed by 2010. Each easement held by MALPF includes requirements for best management practices (BMPs) for environmentally responsible farming, including vegetative buffers along stream corridors. A forestry management plan is required when 50% or more of an easement property is woodland. The preservation of productive agriculture and forestry is the primary goal of the program, and the protection of water and soil quality is an important element of that goal. Contributions of Local Land Conservation Programs Maryland county governments are national leaders in land conservation. A recent Farmland Preservation Report survey reported that five of the 12 top performing local government agricultural land preservation programs in the nation are in MarylandMontgomery, Carroll, Baltimore, Harford and Frederick Counties. Others in Maryland are close to making the top-twelve list. Several of these and other Maryland counties are also national leaders in preserving open space for recreation and natural resource protection, including those that have outstanding park systems, like Prince George's, Queen Anne's and Montgomery Counties. Together, Maryland Counties have protected more than 103,400 acres of agricultural and woodland through the purchase or transfer of development rights resulting in permanent easements. For example, Maryland counties have protected 60% of all land that is protected throughout the United States with Transfers of Development Rights ordinances. Maryland Counties work closely in partnership with the Maryland Environmental Trust and Departments of Natural Resources and Agriculture in coordinating and matching state funded land preservation programs with local resources and preservation programs. Contributions of Federal Land Conservation Assistance Maryland's land conservation programs utilize a number of federal funding programs for land conservation, which provide significant financial support to increase the State's ability to protect land. These include:  Land and Water Conservation Act (LWCF), National Park Service. Congress adopted this act in 1966 and it utilizes revenues from oil and gas leases of the outer continental shelf for land conservation and parks. While funding for state projects was interrupted for several years during the 1990s, more than $75 million in LWCF funds have been granted to Maryland. POS administers these funds, matches the federal funds with POS transfer tax revenues, and distributes 50% of the federal funds to local jurisdictions according to the POS allocation formula. In FY 2003, POS was apportioned $1,886,043 in LWCF funds. DNR also has utilized a special allocation of LWCF funds for the National Park Service's American Battlefield Protection Program to acquire conservation easements on Civil War sites at Antietam and South Mountain battlefields.  15     Forest Legacy Program (FLP), U.S. Department of Agriculture. The FLP operates in partnership with states, supporting state efforts to protect environmentally sensitive forestlands. Designed to encourage the protection of privately owned forestlands, FLP provides matching funds to acquire conservation easements on private lands in statedesignated Forest Legacy Areas. Administered by the DNR Forest Service, FLP funds are matched by RLP and POS funds, and have acquired easements on 966 acres of productive forests in several parts of the State. Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program (FRPP), U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The NRCS makes awards to state and local governments and private land trusts based on a competitive system utilizing the Land Evaluation Site Analysis. These awards protect prime agricultural lands with conservation easements jointly funded by MALPF, the counties, or other sources. Grant awards from the FRPP were $2,545,000 in FY2002, and $4,900,464 in FY2003, with $4,040,301 of FY2003 grants dedicated to MALPF. North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA), U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service. Several major land conservation projects have been jointly funded in Maryland by NAWCA grants, which are matched by Rural Legacy, Program Open Space and other sources. The grants are used to protect wetlands and other natural habitat for migrating waterfowl as part of international efforts to maintain the North American Flyway along Maryland's Eastern Shore, including Lands End and Chino Farms in Queen Anne's County. TEA21  Transportation Enhancement Funds, Federal Highway Administration and Maryland Department of Transportation. In the past ten years, DNR has utilized more than $8.5 million in funds on a 50%-50% matching basis with POS and TEA21 Transportation Enhancement funds. These funds have been used to acquire fee interests or conservation easements on 41 Civil War sites at Antietam, South Mountain and Monocacy battlefields, totaling about 5,200 acres. Other significant DNR acquisition projects also have been jointly funded with Transportation Enhancement funds, such as Holly Beach in Anne Arundel County and Douglas Point in Charles County. Maryland's local jurisdictions have received more than $11.8 million in Transportation Enhancement funds for land preservation, mitigation of water pollution due to highway runoff, reduction of wildlife mortality, bike and pedestrian facilities, and preservation of abandoned rail lines and historic structures.

The two main categories into which watersheds are sorted and prioritized are Bay Restoration Potential and Forest Ecological Value. Two other categories can be used to further prioritize watersheds by combining them with the two main categories: Forest Economic Value (to the forest products industry) and Vulnerability to land use change. The last two categories can be combined with the first two categories to further prioritize watersheds if desired. For example, combining Forest Ecological Value and Vulnerability allows us to identify the most ecologically valuable watersheds that are also most vulnerable to degradation from future development activities; combining Forest Ecological Value and Forest Economic Value allows us to identify the watersheds that contain the most ecologically valuable forest lands and those forest lands that are most economically valuable to the forest industry. This helps us to focus on areas where, if the forests were lost, there would be a double loss  ecological and water quality services to the public and economic opportunities and jobs to the forest industry. The Bay Restoration Potential category prioritizes watersheds based on their nutrient load contribution to the Bay and it's tributaries, the need and potential for restoration opportunities (e.g. wetland, riparian buffer and Green Infrastructure ""gap"") that help reduce non-point source pollution, and the amount of impervious surface in the watershed (which is an indicator of the magnitude of influence restoration activities will have on water quality). (Figure 1) Detailed information is available in the Appendix  Land Conservation for Water Quality Improvement Potential.  1   The Forest Ecological Value category prioritizes watersheds based on their ability to provide ecological services to the public, such as water quality improvement, wildlife and aquatic habitat, flood storage and reduction, nutrient cycling, etc. (Figure 2). The Ecological Value ranking is based on the Green Infrastructure Assessment methodology applied to all forests in Maryland.  The Forest Economic Value is based on the Maryland Strategic Forest Land Assessment's economic model (Figure 3). It prioritizes all forestlands in Maryland based on their relative economic value to the forest products industry.  2   Vulnerability is the potential for an undeveloped area to be converted to a developed land use by 2020 (Figure 4). This information was created for the Green Infrastructure Assessment and Strategic Forest Land Assessment. It is an indicator of the potential for the loss of natural features, and their functions and values.  The watersheds used in this prioritization methodology are referred to as the ""Maryland 8-digit watersheds"". There are 134 of these watersheds in Maryland and they average 70 square miles in size. Once a watershed or project is selected for a land conservation activity (Figure 5), DNR has the capability to prioritize areas within that watershed or project for implementation of restoration and management activities.  3   For example, ""gaps"" in the Green Infrastructure can be identified and prioritized based on a restoration activity's (e.g. wetland or buffer restoration) ability to contribute to water quality enhancement (Figure 6). The watershed prioritized as high for Bay Restoration Potential would serve as focus areas for integrated delivery of DNR's (and ideally other State agency's) stewardship and restoration programs.  4   Appendix. Methods - Land Conservation for Water Quality Improvement Potential A series of landscape parameters were analyzed at the watershed level to identify and prioritize areas for opportunity to improve water quality. A matrix (see Table 1) was created to show parameters and a ranking scheme. In total, six parameters were used to assess potential to improve water quality. Watershed scale data was developed using Maryland's 8-digit watersheds. There are 134 of these watersheds in the State with an average size of 70 square miles As listed in Table 1, parameters were combined using the outlined ranking to yield a map of watersheds where water quality was typically poor and in need of improvement (see figure 1). Also, data was included to direct restoration efforts toward watersheds where multiple benefits would occur (e.g., Acres of Green Infrastructure gaps, Unforested Riparian Buffer). A brief description and breakdown of the parameters and their justification follows: Water Quality-NPS Nitrogen  A primary target of Chesapeake Bay restoration is the reduction of nitrogen loadings. To help identify sources of nitrogen loading to the Bay, the USGS produced the Spatially Referenced Regressions on Watershed Attributes Model or ""SPARROW"" (Preston and Brakebill 1999). The model identifies sources of nutrients by relating upstream nutrient sources to downstream nutrient loads measured at monitoring stations Percent Unforested Riparian Buffer  The presence of riparian buffer along streams and rivers has been found to provide multiple water quality, aquatic, and terrestrial habitat benefits (Jones et. al 2001, Lowrance et. al 1996). Consequently, reforesting of streamside buffers is an encouraged best management practice (BMP) in watershed restoration. Percent Non-Wetland Hydric Soils - Hydric soils exhibit physical and chemical properties that are commonly associated with being wet for long periods of time (i.e. those that support wetlands). Restoring the hydrology necessary to support a wetland is more likely achieved on hydric soils that are either currently, or once were, wet. A restored wetland can offer multiple benefits such as flood mitigation, groundwater recharge, and sediment and nutrient trapping (Tiner et al. 2000). Percent Impervious Surface  Maryland DNR research has found that impervious surface cover relates to degradation of aquatic resources in watersheds (Broward et. al 1999). Indeed, impervious cover at levels of 3% of a watershed begins to impact fish species such as Brook Trout. At higher levels (e.g., 25%) research suggests that stream channel stability and biology are seriously degraded (CWP 2003). CWAP - Priority Category 1 Watersheds  Maryland developed its Unified Watershed Assessment (MDNR 1998) to identify watersheds needing restoration  5   and protection, respectively referred to as Category 1 and Category 3 watersheds. A further category, Priority Category 1, was created to help better prioritize restoration activities. Watersheds in this category failed to meet half of the benchmarks necessary to indicate a healthy watershed (thereby indicating the need for restoration). Acres of Green Infrastructure Gaps - Maryland's Green Infrastructure Assessment identifies gaps in the statewide hub and corridor network and prioritizes these gaps for forest and wetland restoration (Weber 2003). Many of the parameters used to prioritize gaps for restoration are directly related to anticipated water quality benefits associated with the restoration activity. The total acres of green infrastructure gaps is an indicator of opportunity for restoration aimed at achieving multiple water quality and habitat benefits. Through the use of these parameters, restoration efforts would be directed to those watersheds with non-point source pollution problems and where opportunities exist to implement BMPs aimed at improving water quality. Additionally, restoration through use of BMPs like wetland restoration and riparian reforestation would provide suitable habitat for both terrestrial and aquatic species.

Governor William Janklow offers the following information to assist you in showing the proper respect to the U.S. Flag: 1. What' the proper way to pledge allegiance to the Flag? s Unless in uniform, you should stand at attention facing the Flag with your right hand over your heart. Men wearing hats should remove the hat with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, so their hand is positioned over the heart. How should proper respect be paid to the Flag? The Flag should not be dipped to any person or thing, and should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground or floor. The Flag itself should never be used as apparel, bedding, or drapery. Should the Flag be flown at night? Customarily, the Flag is only displayed from sunrise to sunset on buildings and flagstaffs. The Flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness. ""Proper illumination"" means having a sufficient light source so the Flag is recognizable to the casual observer. Should the Flag be flown during rain or inclement weather? The Flag should not be displayed during inclement weather except when an all-weather Flag made of nylon or other non-absorbent material is used. How are other flags to be displayed or flown with the Flag of the United States? Other flags should not be placed in a position above or in superior prominence to the U.S. Flag; flags of other nations may be displayed at the same height as the Flag in accordance with international rules. If the Flag is not flown from a staff, how should it be displayed? The Flag should be displayed vertically and suspended so that its folds will fall free. The stripes may be displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall or in a window. In such a case, the union (the stars on the blue field) should be uppermost and to the observer' left. s How should the Flag be positioned on a speaker' s platform or in a public meeting place? On a speaker' s platform, the Flag is displayed above and behind the speaker. In a public auditorium or meeting room, the Flag is placed prominently in front of the audience to the right of the speaker as he faces the audience; any other flag should be to the left of the speaker. Why and when are flags flown at half-staff? The halfstaffed flag is a sign that the nation mourns the death of a person or persons. Only the President or a state Governor may order the Flag to be half-staffed. On Memorial Day, the Flag is half-staffed from sunrise to noon, and raised to full staff from noon to sunset. All other flags are lowered or removed when the U.S. Flag is at half-staff. 9. May a flag patch be worn on a jacket? Only members of the military, firefighters, police officers, or patriotic organizations may wear a Flag patch on their uniform. The U.S. Flag Code deems the use of a Flag patch on costumes, athletic clothing, or casual wear as inappropriate. 10. Is it permissible to clean a soiled flag or dispose of one that is worn out? When a Flag has served its useful purpose, it should be destroyed, preferably by burning. Patriotic organizations often hold Flag disposal ceremonies on Flag Day (June 14). A Flag may be washed or dry-cleaned, depending on the type of material.  2.  Direct Payment Permits Offer Easier Tax Compliance Some South Dakota businesses are now able to purchase taxable goods and services without immediate payment of tax to the supplier through the use of direct payment permits. The permits, issued by the Department of Revenue, allow taxpayers to accrue and pay the use tax on their purchases directly to the department. To qualify for a direct payment permit, the taxpayer must have a South Dakota sales, use, manufacturer, or wholesaler tax license and have annual purchases of tangible personal property and services totaling at least $3 million that are subject to sales and use tax. Businesses receiving a copy of a direct payment permit or documentation including the direct payment permit number from their customer are not required to pay sales tax on sales made to that customer, except on certain transactions. The following items may not be purchased with the direct payment permit: taxable meals or beverages; taxable lodging or services related thereto; admissions to places of amusement, entertainment or athletic events, or the privilege of use of amusement devices; motor vehicles or other tangible personal property required to be licensed or titled with a taxing authority, taxed under Title 32; telecommunications services and utilities (gas, electricity, and heating fuel); or such other purchases as may be agreed to between the holder of the direct payment permit and the department. Revenue officials say the direct payment permit process will allow taxpayers to better accommodate new electronic business practices and administer their tax compliance. Thirty-four states now offer direct payment permits. Interested businesses can contact the department at 1-800TAX(829)-9188 for more information.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.

Any person contracting with a prime contractor to perform traffic control as part of a highway construction project is a subcontractor. This includes all publicly funded road projects. If the subcontractor receives a prime contractors' exemption certificate, their receipts are not subject to contractors'excise tax. Traffic control services on all projects except highway construction are subject to the 4% state sales tax plus applicable municipal tax. Traffic control services for qualified utility projects are subject to sales tax.  IA/SD - Contractors' Excise Tax January 24, 2002 1:00pm - 4:00pm Sioux Falls, SD SD/NE - Sales Tax February 13, 2002 9:00am - 12:00pm Vermillion, SD SD/NE - Sales Tax March 13, 2002 1:00pm - 4:00pm Sioux Falls, SD MN/SD - Sales Tax March 26, 2002 1:00pm - 4:30pm Contractors'Excise Tax March 27, 2002 9:00am - 12:00pm St. Paul, MN  Independent Contractors Individuals providing services or making realty improvements who call themselves ""Independent contractors"" are required to have a sales or contractors' excise tax license with the SD Department of Revenue. If an IRS 1099 form is given to a service provider, services in South Dakota are subject to sales tax or contractors'excise tax whether they are performed by an individual, daylaborer, independent contractor or business.  Municipal Taxes on Food A change in the USDA' Food Stamp Program will affect s the way many retailers collect municipal tax on food. Any food that is sold cold or frozen is subject to the municipal tax rate for food as defined by the Food Stamp Act, even if the customer can heat it on site. Items such as frozen burritos, cold sandwiches and frozen pizzas will no longer be taxed at the prepared food (higher) rate. Food items that are prepared and sold hot by the retailer are still subject to the municipal tax rate for prepared food. Food such as hotdogs, chicken, pizza and potato wedges are examples of prepared food. Municipalities may impose a 1% sales tax on food as defined by the Food Stamp Act and a sales tax of up to 3% on prepared food. Municipal taxes are in addition to the State' s 4% sales tax.  All tax seminars are offered free of charge but registration is required. To register, call our toll-free helpline at 1-800TAX(829)-9188 or visit our website at www.state.sd.us/ revenue.

Oregon Depar tment of Energy Their unique private-public partnerships support projects that are decreasing traffic and stimulating the local economy. ""There are alternatives to the solo-driver trips that will reduce gas consumption, air pollution, and traffic congestion,"" said Kathy King, Transportation Program Manager for the Department of Energy. ""We want businesses, non-profits, and public entities to understand the options and show them how the community can benefit by working together."" The options are for businesses to encourage employees to carpool, bike, walk to work or to telework (work from home). For most commuters, however, the driving solo ""habit"" is hard to break. As with any behavior modification, encouragement helps. Employers in Bend -- both large and small -- are having success with incentive programs that encourage their employees to try these alternatives. And, the Department of Energy encourages the Commute Options Director Jeff Monson (right) meets with Gail Moulton, manager of the Pine Tavern, to order additional incen- businesses to offer such incentives programs by providing a tives for transporation program. The incentives help the Pine Tavern during slow winter months in the highly competitive Business Energy Tax Credit.

Pass-through option Non-profits and public entities with no Oregon tax liability can now participate in the tax credit program if they partner with a business that accepts the tax credit for them in exchange for a payment. The unique private-public partnership means non-profits and public entities can stretch their projects by a third and save even more energy. Hospital incentive program The Business Energy Tax Credit Pass-through Option allowed the non-profit St. Charles Medical Center to expand their employee incentive plan. St. Charles Medical Center, the largest employer in Bend with 1,800 employees (and another 400 at its Redmond campus), buys gift certificates and awards them to employees who carpool, bike or walk to work. Employees chose the four participating retailers. They selected:  Pine Tavern - restaurant  FootZone  running apparel and footwear  Deschutes Brewery  restaurant  Sunnyside Sports - cycling and cross-country ski shop For every 30 times an employee carpools, bikes or walks to work, he or she can select a $30 gift certificate from one of the participating retailers. St. Charles contracts with Jeff Monson of Commute Options to manage their employee program. Commute Options is a Central Oregon non-profit organization that works with employers to offer choices that reduce traffic congestion, promote livability and improve health. Monson, with the assistance of a hospital employee committee, organizes a quarterly transportation fair at the hospital and holds a year-end award ceremony to market the program to St. Charles employees. ""We know this program works,"" said Monson. ""When the hospital dropped the program for 18 months about two years ago, total participation dropped off considerably."" Today the program averages 18 percent of the employees or 278 participants. This translates into a reduction of an estimated 7,450 gallons of gas and nearly 150,000 vehicle miles a year. When the Legislature approved the Passthrough Option for the Tax Credit Program, the non-profit St. Charles Medical Center could qualify for their incentive program that reduces employees' single-car commutes.  St. Charles Medical Center employees who bike to work have a secure, dry place to keep their bicycles during work.   Commute Options Working with Commute Options, the retail partners provide St. Charles additional employee incentive certificates in exchange for the tax credit. St. Charles has purchased $15,000 in incentive certificates from the businesses in 2002-03. The 35 percent tax credit of $5,250 goes to the business partners and the 33.5 percent payment of $4,995 is used to purchase additional certificates. ""The tax credit pass-through is very helpful,"" said Jim Dover, Human Resources Director for St. Charles. ""In the health care industry, as elsewhere, money is tight. This program allows us to leverage the funds availFootZone employee Ellen Cordes commutes two miles to work able to provide more incentives for our employees."" Helps local businesses too For the Pine Tavern, the St. Charles gift certificates are welcomed. The historic downtown building on serene Mirror Pond of the Deschutes River was built in 1936. But despite its longevity and regional recognition, and the steady growth in area tourism, there is tremendous competition in the Bend restaurant business.  on a daily basis and avoids the hassle of finding a parking space in downtown Bend.  ""There are 236 full-service restaurants in Deschutes County,"" said Gail Moultan, Pine Tavern General Manager for the past 21 years. ""We need local support to survive. Having the gift certificate program is just great for us, especially in the winter months."" ""Lots of hospital employees wear our shoes so this incentive helps our loyal customers,"" said Teague Hatfield, owner of the FootZone. ""But, it also exposes new people to our store. We re-enforce the benefits of the program when people turn in their gift certificates. St. Charles doesn't have to do this, but it makes a more livable community in the long run."" ""Of course, the program benefits our business monetarily. We see a lot of new faces,"" said Gary Bonacker, who owns the 30-year-old Sunnyside Sports along with his wife, Susan, and Don Leet. ""But more important to me is the big picture and that it encourages bike use beyond just recreational use. It's a neat program."" The Pine Tavern, FootZone and Sunnyside Sports provide St. Charles with additional gift certificates at no charge and in exchange gets a portion of the tax credit to use on their Oregon tax liability. Deschutes Brewery The Deschutes Brewery, however, had a different situation. The Brewery owners completed several energy efficiency projects in recent years that were eligible for Business Energy Tax Credits. The company could not take on additional tax credits. Jeff Monson with Commute Options came up with a solution. Monson turned to the Bank of the Cascades which has 14 branches in Central Oregon, Salem and Medford and its headquarters in Bend. He asked if they would consider a partnership with St. Charles so the incentive program could be expanded. They were happy to assist. St. Charles transferred a portion of the tax credit to Bank of the Cascades in exchange for a cash payment from the bank that St. Charles uses to buy more of the retail incentive certificates.   Transportation Projects that Qualify for a Tax Credit The state of Oregon offers the Business Energy Tax Credit to encourage investments in energy conservation, recycling, renewable energy resources and less-polluting transportation fuels. The tax credit is 35 percent of eligible project costs, taken over five years: 10 percent in the first and second years and 5 percent each remaining year. For projects with an eligible cost of $20,000 or less, the tax credit may be taken in one year. Any business that pays Oregon income taxes is eligible for the tax credit. Employers must be located in Oregon. Oregon employers that don't pay or owe state income tax may be able to arrange for a tax credit ""pass-through."" The Oregon Office of Energy administers the tax credit program. Employers must apply and receive approval for the tax credit before starting the project. Bicycle Projects - Purchase bicycles or equipment used to store bicycles for riders to reduce miles driven a minimum of 45 working days per calendar year. Car Sharing Project - A program in which drivers pay to become members in order to have joint access to a fleet of cars. Eligible cost for car sharing includes the cost of operating a car sharing program, including the fair market value of parking spaces used to store the cars available for the program, but does not include the cost of the fleet cars. It does not include operations conducted by a car rental agency. Commuter Pool Vehicle - Purchase vehicles for transporting two or more riders. Vehicle must reduce vehicle miles traveled at least 150 days per calendar year. Transportation districts, mass transit districts, and metropolitan service districts within communities of 50,000 or more people are not eligible. Financial Incentive Programs - Financial incentives paid to riders to reduce vehicle miles driven at least 45 days per calendar year. Employers must submit an incentive program plan for approval by the Oregon Department of Energy. Parking Cash Out - A cash allowance or a transit pass given to an employee in lieu of offering or providing the employee a free or subsidized commuter parking space for a commuter vehicle. Eligible cost for parking cash out includes the cost of providing a commuter parking space. Research, Development and Demonstration Project (RD&D)- An innovative travel reduction project that reduces vehicle miles traveled. The applicant must conduct pre and post surveys that measure travel reduction and submit the results with the application for final certification. Transportation districts, mass transit districts, or metropolitan service districts within communities of 50,000 or more people may not qualify for more than $2 million annually in eligible costs for RD&D projects. Telework - Equipment purchased that allows an employee to work from home or an office closer to home at least 45 working days per calendar year OR purchase of equipment that reduces employees' business-related travel by at least 25 percent. Transit Passes - Transit passes purchased for riders. Monthly pass participants must use transit at least 45 working days per calendar year. The total cost of a group pass program is eligible. The applicant must have a written agreement with a public, private or non-profit transportation provider to pay for transit passes. Equipment used as a shelter for people waiting for transit qualifies if it is part of the transit pass project. Transportation districts, mass transit districts, and metropolitan service districts are not eligible. Transportation Management Services Fees - Fees paid to a Transportation Management Association (TMA) or non-profit organization for providing services to riders that reduce the number of vehicle miles driven. Projects must demonstrate travel reduction or be part of a qualifying transportation project. The fee cannot exceed the cost of the transportation project. The applicant must provide an agreement with the transportation provider for specific services that reduce vehicle miles traveled."
GX009-81-14208364	"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  Office of Community Planning and Development           Consolidated Plan Contact   A CITY PROFILE   Camden City, the second largest municipality in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Statistical Area, is located in the southwestern section of New Jersey.  Camden is the seventh largest City in the state and the largest City in Camden County.  The City is divided into 20 census tracts, all of which vary in character and condition.  Despite Camden's socio-economic decline, the City's strategic location offers hope that this trend may be reversed.  Located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, Camden has easy access to many different forms of transportation.  First of all, 676, I-295, US 30, US 130 and other major roadways all service the City.  Moreover, not only is the Philadelphia International Airport only 20 minutes away, but also, Camden has access to the international market through the City's ports which rank among the nation's leaders in the shipment of bulk cargo.  Finally, Conrail service from Pavonia Yards links the City with the rest of the Northeast Corridor.  In addition to the City's strategic location, Camden also houses county, state and federal government offices through South Camden and the Central Business District.  As a result, the City is the major government center for the County.        THE CONSOLIDATED  PLANNING PROCESS   Camden, like many American urban areas, has traditionally been plagued by numerous problems associated with urban blight.  In order to effectively deal with these obstacles, municipalities must look to social, economic, physical and cultural sectors to sufficiently stabilize the community and improve the quality of life for city residents.  Although governmental units have traditionally dealt with many urban issued and problems separately, the Consolidated Plan represents a joint effort between a variety of governmental units, thereby helping to create a unified approach to the identification and resolution of the problems which characteristically trouble urban areas.  In order to facilitate a wide range of participation in the planning process, the City took a number of different measures.  First of all, the City formed two committees.  One committee, the Intergovernmental Communications Committee, consists of departments, agencies and non-profit organizations that receive federal and state funding.  This committee provided technical review for the Consolidated Plan Advisory Committee. The Consolidated Plan Advisory Committee is comprised of Division Directors from most city departments and agencies, as well as those from non-profit housing and homeless organizations.  The committee was divided into the following subcommittees.  Affordable Housing, Homelessness, Public Housing, Special Needs and Non-Housing Community Development Issues.  In addition to the two committees, two agencies, the Camden Redevelopment Agency and the Division of Planning, acted as overall lead agencies for the Plan process.  The Division of Grants Management also provided technical support in the computerization of the Plan.  These lead agencies performed a number of roles including, but not limited to, the organization of meetings and public hearings, the provision of technical assistance, the dissemination of information regarding meetings and the provision of copies of the Plan for public viewing.        HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT   Population   Camden's population is relatively diverse with all populations, other than Whites, growing.  The City's racial composition is as follows: African-Americans - 54% (14,414), Hispanics - 24% (6, 374), Whites - 20% (5,331), Asian and Pacific Islanders - 1% (285) and Native Americans - less than 1% (70).  As previously mentioned, Whites represent the only decreasing population; all other populations are increasing with the Asian Pacific Islander population growing the fastest at a remarkable 300%.  The city population as a whole has seen a 3% increase since the 1980 census.  Since the 1980 census households in the City have decreased by 9%, leaving approximately 26,626 households within Camden.  Of these households, roughly 53% are considered to be extremely low-income (less than 50% of Median Family Income [MFI]).  Areas of Low Income Concentrations   Camden possesses 5 neighborhoods in which the incomes average below $15,000 dollars and are therefore considered to be concentrated areas of very low and extremely low incomes.  They are as follows: Central Business District, Centerville, Cooper Grant, Bergen Square and Cramer Hill/Pavonia.  Housing Market Condition   Built before the end of World War II, the City's housing stock is a mix of brick row homes, twins, duplexes and small apartment buildings.  Of the 26,626 occupied housing units in the City, 13,748 are renter-occupied and 12,878 are owner-occupied.  An additional 5,267 are either for rent (1,224), for sale (531) or abandoned (3,512).  An estimated 3,512 renter and owner-occupied houses are substandard; an additional 2,230 are substandard but suitable for rehabilitation.  The Fairview, Marlton, Cooper Grant and Stockton neighborhoods still retain homes in good to excellent condition.  Median rent in Camden City has increased by 113% as compared with a figure of 109% for the County.  Moreover, the City's median market-rate rent exceeds median affordable rent by 13% to 28% depending upon the size of the housing unit.  Affordable Housing   As the above statistics indicate, Camden residents face a lack of affordable housing. Naturally, the housing shortage is more accentuated at the lower end of the economic scale.  Among renters, the most need exists in the City's 9,056 renter households which fall in the extremely low income category (0 -30% MFI).  Within this category, households are divided into two categories - ""small related"" (2-4 persons) and ""large related"" (5 or more persons).  Roughly 78% (2,256) of small related households and 91% (1,359) of large related households experience housing problems.  Within the owner-occupied units, the same group, the extremely low-income, experiences the largest percentage of housing.  Approximately 74% (375) of these owners experience housing difficulties.  The next economic category, the very low income (31 - 50%), are close behind with around 71% (150) of those owners facing problems with housing.   Homelessness   Homelessness is caused by a wide variety of social and economic issues.  Consequently, the population has a plethora of diverse and unmet needs for which and overall strategy is necessary.  Three major causes are the shortage of affordable housing, deinstitutionalization and drug and alcohol abuse.  Not only is it difficult to identify the causes of homelessness, it is also problematic to identify the number of homeless in the City.  However, by utilizing an unduplicated count of those homeless persons being admitted to emergency shelter, one can derive a total number of 2,692 as of 1991.  This figure represents a 78.7% increase over the unduplicated count in 1989.  Of all city residents, the extremely low-income families on public assistance without subsidized housing remain the highest risk groups.  Many of these families are headed by single females and may constitute the ""hidden homeless population"" or those who reside with family and friends without having their own dwelling.  In order to combat homelessness, a three prong strategy which includes emergency shelter, transitional or rehabilitative services and permanent housing or supportive housing arrangements, is needed.  Within these three categories, homeless providers and the Department of Health and Human Services have identified certain needs which will act as a starting point for improving and sustaining a continuum of care.  Inventory of Facilities for the Homeless   The Consolidated Plan offers an inventory of services for the homeless divided into the six following categories: resource and referral services, case management services, outreach services, emergency support services, emergency shelter services and social services.  Special Needs   Three different groups of people - those with AIDS, the drug and alcohol abusers, the elderly and the frail elderly - are considered to have special needs.  First of all, all 183 known cases of HIV in Camden City require some level of housing and/or services.  Secondly, the 1992 Comprehensive Human Services Plan Update has identified substance abuse as the third most pressing need among the homeless population.  Finally of the City's 7,352 elderly and frail elderly citizens, an estimated 70% are categorized as extremely low-income.  Currently the Camden Housing Authority (CHA) gives homeless senior citizens preference.  Two nursing homes exist within the City, and the CHA maintains several senior citizen housing sites.  Assisted Housing Inventory     Public Housing   The agency primarily responsible for Camden's public housing - The Camden Housing Authority (CHA) - maintains 2,333 units of publicly subsidized and owned housing.  Of these units, approximately 20% (466 units) are vacant.  Through the use of the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Grant Program, $3 million dollars will be used for multi-rehabilitation with the hopes of reducing the vacancy rate to only 10%.  Public housing currently has a waiting list which is divided into two categories - families (those with children) and the disabled (those that are either disabled or on social security).  Priority is presently given to those applicants that are already homeless.  The Consolidated Plan lists and analyzes the needs of the following subsidized sites: Branch Village, Ablett Village, Roosevelt Manor, Chelton Terrace, Westfield Acres, Mickle Towers, J.F.K. Towers, McQuire Garden, Royal Court and Westfield Towers.  For the purpose of comprehensive linkages for community development, the CHA has received $42 million.  Some of this money will be used to create homeownership possibilities, develop employment training programs and form stable community policing programs.  Section 8 Housing   The NJ Department of Community affairs, Bureau of Housing Services is responsible for the Section 8 program.  A total of 860 families are served through Section 8's five different programs.  Of these families, roughly 80% are African-American, 96% are female-headed and 57% are AFDC recipients.    Lead-Based Paint Needs   According to the federal government, lead poisoning could be significantly affected as many as 3 million American children, making it the number one environmental health hazard to the young.  Of this number, people of color and the poor are disproportionately affected.  In Camden, a total of 24,483 households, both renter and owner-occupied, qualify as extremely or very low income.  Of the 18,817 extremely low income households, about 77% (14,235) are identified as possible lead-based paint contamination sites.  In this category, extremely low income homeowners face a higher percentage of risk (80%) than do renters (74%).  The Camden Division of Housing Services has applied for a $200,000 grant from the NJ Department of Community Affairs.  This grant would fund seven different programs which will deal explicitly with lead-based paint hazard.  The programs will be as follows: Homeowners Direct Assistance Grants, Essential Systems Repair Grants, Rental Rehabilitation Program, First Time Homebuyers Program, Home Repairs Initiative Grants/Loans, Senior Moderate Rehabilitation Grants and Homestead/Ownership Program.  Non-Housing Community Development Needs     Economic Factors   Camden had experienced 30 years of erosion of its economic base characterized by industrial and ensuing middle-income flight from the City.  However, since the early- to mid-80s, Camden has begun to show signs of economic recovery.  Although the City's economic growth has not been overwhelmingly large, it has been characterized by a great deal of change within the major economic sectors.  Of New Jersey's seven biggest cities, only three, one of which is Camden, experienced employment gains.  Moreover, the City's per capita income has also experienced a significant rise, although the City still lags behind the national, state and county in that regard.  The type of employment within the City has changed dramatically over the year.  Camden's economy has steadily lost manufacturing jobs while gaining jobs in the health care industry.  In order to stem the flow of vital manufacturing jobs leaving the City, the City needs a strategy to strengthen the manufacturing sector.  According to a 1992 New Jersey Employment and Training Commission study the following linkages need to be established: a community service strategy, a youth apprenticeship program, school to work initiatives (including technical preparation options), literacy programming using public and non-profit agencies and workplace education programs using financial resources from the NJ Workforce Development Partnership Program to improve resident skills.  Public Safety: Crime Activity    Considering the size of Camden, the crime rate is alarming.  Undoubtedly, Camden's crime, of which 65 to 70% is drug-related, limits the City's development more than any other single factor.  Although net crime rates have declined since 1990, serious and drug related crime rates have increased.  Unfortunately, due to the City's overcrowded prisons, many of those arrested on minor drugs charges are often released the next day.  The Plan identifies three major public safety needs - establishment of permanent police districts, an expanded crime prevention program and the establishment of foot patrols in commercial and residential areas.  Educational Disparities:  Building and Nurturing Camden's Youth   Camden, a City with 12.3% more children than the state percentage and 9.1% more than the county percentage, is a ""city of children,"" facing an inordinate amount of socioeconomic conditions which must be changed in order to see the City advance.  These adverse conditions include but are not limited to high rate of poverty among students, student substance abuse, teenage parenthood and high drop-out rates.  Infrastructure Rehabilitation   In order to further facilitate development, developing/developable areas must have adequate utility services.  Currently, two major problems slow efforts to upgrade or replace Camden's infrastructure.  First of all, it is cost prohibitive, and secondly, a lack of coordination with housing rehabilitation and production activities exist.         HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIC PLAN   A Five-Year Plan and Needs Assessment   Resources   The Plan lists the following federal, state, private and other resources which Camden can leverage to enact its strategic plan:    Federal Programs   Empowerment Zone: about $21 million for housing, human and economic development within certain communities.  Community Development Block Grant Program: roughly $3 to $4 million for a wide variety of activities including neighborhood revitalization, economic development, improved community facilities, prevention and elimination of slums and blight, and assistance to low and moderate income families.  Home Program: grant funds to low- and moderate-income households to facilitate a wide variety of housing services and assistance.  Emergency Shelter Grant Program: funding used to improve the quality of existing emergency shelters and also used to increase the number of actual shelters.  Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS: entitlement and competitive grants available to assist and serve persons with AIDS and their families.  Comprehensive Grant Program: funding for public housing authorities to make physical and managerial improvements.  Lead Based Paint Abatement Program: moneys to develop effective lead-abatement strategies for communities.  Section 8 Rental Certificates: rental assistance provided directly to homeowner leasing to assisted families.  Section 8 Rental Voucher Program: rental assistance provided directly to homeowner leasing to assisted families.  HOPE 1 (Public Housing Homeownership): assistance to provide affordable homeownership for residents of public housing.  HOPE 2 (Homeownership of Multi-family Units): assistance in developing homeownership opportunities for the low income through the use of multi-family rental properties.  HOPE 3 (Homeownership of Single Family Homes: financial, homeownership assistance for low-income persons through the use of single-family housing in public ownership.  State Programs   Neighborhood Preservation Program: funds municipalities to rehabilitate and revitalize neighborhoods.  Balanced Housing Programs: funds developers producing low- and moderate-income housing.    Private Resources   New Jersey Housing Financing Agency: $20 million low-income tax credit construction loan fund for Camden.  1st. Fidelity Savings Bank: $175,000 loan pool.  Mid-Atlantic Bank: $175,000 loan pool.  Chemical Bank of New Jersey: $175,000 loan pool.  Camden County CDBG: $150,000 loan pool.  Delaware Valley Reinvestment Fund: $13 million loan pool/ $2.4 million available for housing and lending to non-profits.  Cogen Technologies: private donations for community development.  Martin Marietta: private donations for community development.    Priorities and Projects   In addition, the Consolidated Plan compiled the following list stating the five major categories and the various priorities within each:    Affordable Housing  - rehabilitation of substandard, private/public vacant housing, rehabilitation of vacant units for low income homeownership, new construction for rent and home ownership, rehabilitation of owner-occupied housing and rehabilitation of vacant housing for rent.      Homelessness  - the establishment of permanent comprehensive support serves to assess and treat homelessness, maintain the number of shelters to maximize the transitional and permanent housing opportunities and the creation of permanent housing.      Special Needs Housing  - provide supportive housing for special needs and assist the production of barrier free housing.      Public Housing  - stabilize existing public housing stock, develop employment opportunities for existing resident, transition residents to homeownership opportunities.      Community Development  - create youth development opportunities, expand economic opportunities, upgrade existing infrastructure, expand community policing programs and create permanent police districts.           ACTION PLAN   One Year Use of Funds   Approximately 42 housing and community development projects which will eventually address the previous priorities are planned for the fiscal year of 1995.  The following list identifies the source and amount of funds:    Community Development Block Grant Funds           $4,016,000   Emergency Shelter Grant Program                    1,231,000   Home Homeownership Program                           148,000     In addition to the above list, the City will continue to search for additional sources of funding.   A selection committee has been developed to review all projects to be included in the Consolidated Plan's Action Plan.  The committee members are as follows:    Mayor Arnold E. Webster, Ph.D.    Patrick J. Keating, Business Administrator    Morris Smith, City Attorney    Thomas Robert, Executive Director, Redevelopment Agency      Eliezer Martinez, Ph.D. Commissioner, Housing and Community Development    Charles Williams, Commissioner, Dept. of Health and Human Services    Novella Hinson, Commissioner, Dept. of Community Affairs    Edward Williams, Supervision Planner, Division of Planning    Deborah Polk, Coordinator of Federal and State Aid, Division of Management Grants           PUBLIC POLICY PROBLEMS   Barriers to Affordable Housing   The Consolidated Plan identifies eight public policy barriers to Camden's attainment of affordable housing:  1. The City should repeal a restrictive zoning ordinance that prohibits shelters and some forms of transitional housing for homeless and other low income single persons.   2. The City should modify its inefficient development review process that creates lengthy delays for developers.   3. The City lacks qualified, professional staff to enforce zoning and building code ordinances.   4. Many potential homeowners are unable to produce a sufficient down payment toward the purchase of a home.   5. Many potential homeowners are unable to maintain a positive credit rating, thereby limiting many from obtaining a home.   6. Within the City there is much neighborhood opposition to multi-family and non-traditional housing alternatives.   7. Local banking institutions and corporations do not sufficiently invest in the neighborhood  revitalization process.   8. Current tax policy is not flexible in promoting homeownership opportunities.   Reduction of Barriers   The Consolidated Plan also identifies nine ways in which barriers can be reduced:  1. Homeownership opportunities must be strengthened and increased.    2. Incentives for historic preservation of historic homes must be created.   3. The City must create a Mayor's committee on homelessness.   4. The City of Camden must develop a homeless needs assessment.   5. The City must promote housing for senior citizens and the disabled.   6. The city must improve public housing during the next five years.   7. Neighborhood residents must establish and maintain town watch programs.   8. The city should develop land development and review handbook.   9. All infrastructure rehabilitation and improvement projects must target those are undergoing substantial development or redevelopment.   Other Policy Actions   Finally, the Consolidated Plan also recommends policy actions in the area of public housing, lead based paint hazard and poverty reduction/prevention.        IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:  INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE AND  INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION   The institutional structure and the organization thereof is essential to the success of the Consolidated Plan.  A coordination of efforts between public city agencies, public county agencies and non-profit organizations, as well as financing from local financial institutions are both necessary.  Public City Agencies:  Camden Redevelopment Agency, Division of Planning, Camden Housing Authority, Department of Housing and Community Development, Department of Health and Human Services and the Empowerment Zone Entity.  Public County Agencies:   Camden County Department of Community Development, Camden County Department of Health and Human Services, Camden County Improvement Authority, Camden County Workforce Investment Board and Camden Business Assistance Corporations.  Non-Profit Organizations:   St. Joseph Carpenter Society, The Heart of Camden Housing Corp., State St. Housing Corp., Camden Lutheran Housing, Camden Redevelopment Corporation, Habitat for Humanity, Camden Neighborhood Housing Services, Jaycee Housing Corp., The North Camden Land Trust and Volunteers of America.

The FY 2002 proposed operating budget is $148,622,000, an increase of $10,549,000, or 7.6 percent, over the FY 2001 approved budget. The FY 2002 proposed capital budget is $65,600,000.  Agency Background The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority provides an integrated bus and rail system for the metropolitan area. The Authority was created in 1967 through an interstate compact with the District of Columbia, the state of Maryland, and the commonwealth of Virginia. The Board of Directors, which is composed of representatives from each jurisdiction, governs the Authority. Its staff is charged with conducting operating and system administration, establishing fares, and determining funding from various sources, including the share of the subsidy from participating jurisdictions. Following a trend that began in 1997, Metrobus and Metrorail ridership continue to increase. Current weekday rail ridership grew 4.1 percent from FY 1999 to FY 2000 and bus ridership grew 10.3 percent. Ridership growth is  Strategic Issues  Stimulate the District economy by increasing accessibility to downtown for tourists as well as downtown workers and residents.  FY 2002 Initiatives The following projects are proposed:  Operation of 100 new Metrorail cars to relieve overcrowding and accommodate ridership growth on Metrorail.  Increase bus and rail service throughout the city in order to increase access to jobs, schools,  Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority  F-29   Figure KE0-1  Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Division of Transportation Office of the Director  Design, Engineering, and Construction Administration  Office of Mass Transit  Office of Intermodal Planning  WMATA Liaison  Special Projects  Economic Projects  School Transit Subsidy  Metrorail Operations and Construction  Bus Operations  Franchise Shelter  Bus Planning  expected to be 7 percent on rail and 3 percent on bus for FY 2002. This growth is causing overcrowding on rail cars and buses, necessitating additional rail and bus operations.  Programs Figure KE0-1 shows the organization of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. District Metrobus operations provide service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on approximately 101 routes throughout the District that serve an average weekday ridership of 289,000. District Metrorail operations maintain the Metrorail system for District residents. WMATA currently operates 103 miles of the system in the metropolitan area with 83 stations. Approximately 38 miles of the operating rail system and 39 stations are located in the District. The District's Metrorail Debt Service finances the District's annual share of $997 million in bonds sold by WMATA in the 1970s for the rail construction program. This payment is consistent with the Ancillary Bond Repayment Participation Agreement entered into by the District of Columbia, the state of  Maryland, the commonwealth of Virginia, and the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. Note that the Department of Public Works' Office of Mass Transit (OMT) is the District's liaison office with WMATA. OMT staff monitor and evaluate the provision of Metrobus and Metrorail service, prepare the annual subsidy budget, and process quarterly payments for the District's subsidy to WMATA.  Funding Summary Local The proposed local FY 2002 budget is $148,622,000, an increase of $10,549,000 over the FY 2001 approved budget. Refer to the FY 2002 Operating Appendices (bound separately) for details. The WMATA operating budget is composed of nonpersonal services which includes funding for the following:  $3.2 million to operate 100 new Metrorail cars, currently on order, to relieve overcrowding and accommodate ridership growth on the Metrorail system.

GX010-83-12834643	"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  Office of Community Planning and Development           Consolidated Plan Contact    CITIZEN'S SUMMARY   The City of Roseville, in southeastern Michigan, Macomb County, is located north of the City of Detroit.  The City is a suburban community which has developed primarily between the Gratiot Avenue and Groesbeck Avenue corridors within the County .  Action Plan   The City of Roseville will be receiving $577,000 for the Community Development Block Grant(CDBG) Entitlement Program during the federal fiscal year 1995.  In addition the City expects to earn an additional $175,000 in program income from previously funded projects, plus $20,000 in reallocated funds.  The projects planned to be funded by these funds include: single family housing rehabilitation, public services, public facilities and improvements, planning and administration.  Citizen Participation   The Roseville City Council has delegated the oversight of the Community Development Block Grant Program to the Citizen Advisory Committee(CAC).  The CAC meets with City staff to prepare the CDBG budget, review the annual  Grantee Performance Report(GPR), grant waivers of the dollar limits to the rehab program, and to provide input and guidance to the program.  In addition  at least two public hearings a year are held on the program,  in compliance to the City of Roseville Citizen Participation Plan.    COMMUNITY PROFILE   The City of Roseville was incorporated on April 1, 1957 during the height of the  expansion years of the City of Detroit's suburbs.  However, the community began developing 150 years earlier, evidenced by scattered farmhouses still remaining throughout the city.  Suburbanization of the rural community began at the turn of the century due to the interurban streetcar line on Gratiot Avenue which extended north to Port Huron and south to the City of Detroit.  The City of Roseville's largest escalation in population occurred in the post war era of the  1950's through 1960's.  The City's current population, according to the 1990 US Census, is 51,412.  This is a decrease of 5% from the 1980 populations total.  This loss differs from the continued growth experience in Macomb County.  The County has continued to grow due to its expansive territory remaining open to development.  Although Roseville's population has slightly declined, the number of households in the city increased from 16,453 households in 1970 to 19,537 in 1990.  This  increase resulted from the trend of households becoming smaller, that is, fewer persons per household.  Thus smaller family size reduces the population but not the need for additional housing units.  The most significant change in Roseville's population has been the increase in  the number of elderly persons.  The number of persons over the age of 65 increased by 2, 731 persons, for a total of 7,028 persons above the age of 65.  In 1980 the percentage of persons above ave 65 was 7.9% of the total population.  In 1990 that percentage had risen to 13.7%.  The rise in the number of elderly has increased the median age in the city to 28.1 years, up from 23.2 years recorded in 1970.  Overall, 12.6 percent of all households in Roseville were headed by single women, an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous decade.  The racial composition, by percent of population, did not change during the 1980's.  One percent of the population was African American in 1990, unchanged from the 1 percent recorded in 1980.  The actual number of persons however, decreased by 108 persons from 621 in 1980 to 513 persons in 1990.    HOUSING AND COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT NEEDS   Conditions   As the City ages so does the population and housing stock.  As the growth of the outlying areas of Macomb County continues, it is assumed that families with income will continue to leave the older housing stock of inner ring suburbs in favor of new housing to the north.  In-migration of lower income elderly and female headed households poses new housing requirements for the City of Roseville.  The need for housing assistance programs continues to grow with the shift in population.  Housing Needs   Housing needs are determined by focusing on what is lacking in the housing inventory for certain household types.  ""Need"" implies desire for housing which may be beyond the income or housing quality limitations of certain households in the community.  Households and families in Roseville with the ""worst case"" needs are:    unassisted very low income renter households who pay more than half their income for rent;  persons living in seriously substandard housing;  those who have been involuntarily displaced from their current housing.    According to the 1990 Census, forty-four percent of all renter households in Roseville, have earnings less than $20,000, within  the  threshold for very low income households.  these households also experience the greatest extent of cost burden, with 61 percent paying more than 30 percent of household income on housing costs.  Households with earnings between $20,000 and $29,999, which would be considered ""low"" but not ""very low"" income, constitute another 31 percent of the total share of renter occupied households.   Eighty-three percent of very low income renter households in Roseville are cost- burdened, with 1,199 renter households paying more than 50% of their income for housing costs.  Seventy-five percent of Roseville's  occupied housing units are homeowners.  The number of low income owners is low due to the greater number of owners in the higher income categories.  However, the number of ""low"" income homeowner households ($20,000 - $29,999) is far greater than the same income group of renters.  Eighty-five percent of very low income owner households are cost burdened, with 1,537 owners paying more than 54% of their income for housing costs.  Housing Market Conditions   The 1990 Census reports a total of 20,025 units in Roseville's housing stock.  Ninety-five percent of all available useable land has been developed for urban uses.  Thus the extensive growth of housing without clearance is limited.   Home ownership in Roseville is substantial with 14,571 owner occupied units in 1990, or 74.6 percent of the total units.    Due to the construction of several large apartment complexes in the past decade, renter occupied units in the city have increased.  In 1990, 4,966 renter occupied units represented 25.4 percent of all occupied units.  This is an increase of 1,220 renter units over the 1980 total.   Affordable Housing Needs   The age of the housing stock in the City of Roseville contributes to a high amount of substandard housing in the City.  This will require continued efforts  to provide housing rehabilitation assistance programs.  Very low income homeowners and renters both have been shown to be cost burdened with respect to housing.  Both groups need rehabilitation assistance programs to maintain their units, as well as to increase the supply of affordable owner and renter housing.   The high percentage of elderly households in the City, and the fact that the elderly population continues to grow, indicates the need for increased affordable housing for the elderly, both in terms of rehabilitation assistance and in the maintenance of affordable rental senior housing.  Homeless Needs   The Macomb Coalition for Emergency Shelter(MCES) reported 3,939 homeless sheltered in Macomb County for twelve months of 1994.  The two main shelters serving Roseville and Macomb County are Turning Point located in Mount Clemens, and MATTS located in Warren.  In 1994, Turning Point counted 13,212 beds occupied at night and MATTS counted 8,584 for the same period.  Eight percent of those that were served by these two shelters listed Roseville  as their last known place of residence.  MCES was appointed by the Macomb County Board of Commissioners in 1990 to study the needs and identify the barriers that exist and contribute to homelessness.  The results of the committee's study was published in 1991 titled, ""More Than a Bed for the Night.""  In the report, researchers concluded that the principal causes for homelessness in the County were lack of affordable housing, and extreme poverty.  Many root causes were further identified: the failure of appropriate job training to prepare low income persons for jobs in today's market; and the physical condition of housing which is affordable to the very lowest income population.  Other principal reasons for homelessness were: eviction due to lack of income, problems with relatives, substance abuse, elimination of State funding and General Assistance Programs, and a shift away from manufacturing employment in the Metro Detroit area.  The lack of transportation continues to be an important factor in promoting homelessness in the County.  Recently the voters in the County passed a millage initiative which creates funding for the Southeastern Michigan Area Transportation(SMART) bus system.  This system will give access the service job employment centers to those previously without transportation.  Public and Assisted Housing Needs   The City of Roseville Housing Commission administers 172 Section 8 certificates and 132 Section 8 vouchers.  Priorities for issuing these certificates include: housing assistance to the elderly and small families.  Female headed households have received approximately 75 percent of the City's Section 8 housing  vouchers and certificates and 60 percent of the rehabilitation program's assisted  projects.  The Roseville Housing Commission also managers 102 senior citizen public housing units at the Lawn Street apartments and 134 units at the Eastland Street apartments.  The Commission works with twenty-five apartment complexes, seven townhouse developments, and ninety-two private landlords and management companies to place residents in qualified housing in the Roseville area.  The waiting lists for these certificates and vouchers far exceed the Housing Commission's ability to provide for all those eligible.  Barriers to Affordable Housing   No known relevant public policies exist which would impede or affect the production of affordable housing units in the City of Roseville.  Traditionally Zoning Ordinances are seen as a regulatory barrier when new uses of land, which would prove to be more affordable to very low income households, are restricted.  No recent instances of such restrictions are recorded in the City of  Roseville.  The zoning codes are used to promote compatible land uses within the City.  Fair Housing   Although little evidence of discriminatory actions exist in the City of Roseville which would prevent fair housing practices, the City continues to asses all barriers to fair housing and promotes programs which are targeted to assist persons with special needs, including those who federal preferences.  The City  fosters anti-discrimination practices, advocates housing alternatives for very low-income persons and encourages programs which assist first-time home buyers.  Lead-Based Paint   The City of Roseville Community Development Block Grant(CDBG) Program monitors lead based paint hazards under its housing rehabilitation project.  Educational information is provided to each homeowner with regard to lead based paint issues, safety of children, and reduction of exposure to pealing or chipping paint.  Other Issues   The needs of homeless, adult disabled, female headed households, and persons who are HIV infected are being considered through a network of care providers who have formed the Macomb Coalition for Emergency Shelter.  This organization was established for the purpose of examining trends, data collection, and reporting on work being done on a Macomb County basis.  Staff  from the Roseville CDBG program attends the meetings of the Coalition.  Through the Coalition the City has the resources to direct persons needing assistance for housing, substance abuse counseling, health care, job training, youth services, and other special needs.  Community Development Needs   The City of Roseville community development needs can be summarized as follows:    Housing rehabilitation and Home ownership assistance programs to provide affordable housing and improve housing opportunities for low and very low income households.   Public service programs to meet the social, economic, health, and quality life needs of low income persons, especially those who are homeless or threatened with homelessness.   Public improvement projects to improve low income neighborhoods and the facilities serving low income residents of these areas.    Coordination   The City of Roseville will work closely with neighboring jurisdictions and the county departments and agencies to provide an area wide solution to housing and community development issues.  City staff will continue to meet with other members of the Macomb Coalition for Emergency Shelter, and with service providers to work through a coordinated approach to solving the areas identified needs.    HOUSING AND COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY   Vision for Change   The strategy for change developed by the City of Roseville includes assessments of the City's housing and homeless needs, public facilities, infrastructure improvements, public services, accessibility, and planning needs.   Housing and Community Development Objectives and Priorities   The strategy for change has been developed in consultation with citizens and local organizations in order to coordinate resources and address the national goals of the Community Development Block Grant(CDBG) Program.  They are:    Preserve, improve and expand the stock or affordable housing in the City of Roseville    Ensure that affordable rental housing is available for very-low and low income elderly, handicapped and family households   Develop assistance programs for homeless individuals and families and those who are at risk of becoming homeless   Maintain and expand the supportive services of persons in need    Promote Fair Housing Opportunities for all persons    Facilitate public/private initiatives to improve the residential quality of Roseville neighborhoods   Identify and reduce barriers to the development of affordable housing.    Housing Priorities   The City of Roseville has set housing priorities to upgrade the existing housing stock through the residential housing rehabilitation program, to assist in the development of affordable housing alternatives for low income owners and renters, to increase the supply of housing for the elderly and those with special needs.   Non-Housing Community Development Priorities   The City through its participation with a network of service providers will continue to provide economic, health and social assistance to those in need within the community by targeting federal funds for this purpose.  Anti-Poverty Strategy   The City of Roseville will continue to utilize federal resources to operate programs which will enable low and very low income households to remain in their homes and to keep these homes in decent, safe, and sanitary condition, while enabling these households to us their limited resources for expenses such as food and clothing.

Over one million bricks were used in the building at a total cost of $ 88,106.05. The Memorial Building is a 3  story, masonry, Richardsonian Romanesque style structure which serves as Vernon Town Hall. The first floor is, rusticated brownstone; brick with brownstone trim at upper floor. The roof is steeply pitched with slate-shingled hip, gabled dormer, octagonal tower, and recessed round-arched entry. The Memorial Hall, located opposite the Council Chambers on the second floor of the Memorial Building, was dedicated in September 1890 and placed in the care of the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union Army veterans. That organization and its successor, the Sons of Union Veterans, have been the caretakers of the Hall ever since. Rockville's G.A.R. Hall is said to be the only remaining original hall in Connecticut. Its original dcor and fine collection of Civil War artifacts assembled for display are a tribute to the dedicated care provided to this historic room. In 1975, a new 8'0"" dropped ceiling was installed in the third floor auditorium (which has a forty foot ceiling) and the space below divided into Town offices. At the same time, an elevator and stair tower were added to the rear of the building. To accommodate these changes, all of the third floor, tower and upper level windows were removed. The window spaces were filled in with concrete block and, at the third floor office level, with aluminum sliding windows. In 1997, the window replacement project was initiated with a study completed by Paul B. Bailey, an architect from New Haven, which resulted in a concept design that was a reasonable replica of the original windows. In June, 2001, the project constructed by Thomas J. Kronenberger of Middletown, Connecticut included removal of the concrete block, the construction and installation of thirty three massive windows, some of which are more than twenty feet in height and twenty four feet in width. The Town of Vernon Department of Public works completed the demolition of all of the third floor offices for a savings of approximately $40,000.00 to the taxpayers of the Town of Vernon. It is the Town's intention to hold an open house to celebrate the completion of the Memorial Building's third floor renovations on July 4, 2003 Note: Information excerpted from Cascades and Courage; and Rockville Historic District  Register of Historic Places.

By presenting the first report of the new millennium, I hope to share with you those accomplishments of prime importance to our community during this last fiscal year. The Town started the fiscal year off with a grand ""July in the Sky"" celebration, which included fireworks from Fox Hill Tower and a reception in the Memorial Building to celebrate the completion of the long awaited window restoration project on its third floor. Town Council endorsed the concept plan for the renovation of Town Hall and G.A. 19 and the Town entered into a contract with Paul B. Bailey, Architect, for drawings, which will also address HVAC, mechanical and electrical impact on the entire building. In order to accomplish this, the Town submitted applications to the Connecticut Historical Commission, Save America's Treasures and Preservation Assistance Grant Program, and the Town anticipates the restoration of the third floor in the Memorial Building to be a project in which the entire community will take pride. The Town was awarded and accepted a $500,000.00 grant for remediation of pollution at the Roosevelt Mill and submitted an application with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Economic Development Initiative, in the amount of $500,000.00 in order to assist in the restoration of Roosevelt Mills. We look forward to addressing the challenges involved in addressing the blighted condition of the mills in our community. The Town received a Brownfields Targeted Site Assessment from the Environmental Protection Agency to test for pollutants at the Hockanum Mill. The Town has also completed the $300, 000 preventative rehabilitation project at the Hockanum Mill, Which included the installation of an elevator to create additional usable industrial space at the mill. Several projects were undertaken such as:    Reconstruction of the Rockville High School football field and track Rockville High School photography project Rockville High School asbestos floor removal project  2    Rockville High School and Henry Park tennis courts restoration.  Lake Street School water line project, including the running of a water line by Connecticut W ater Company to the site.  Installation of sewer lines and lateral connections on Snipsic Street.  Cleanup of the oil spill at Skinner Road School. No free product remains in the ground. The next phase is to proceed to the next level to complete the remediation of the site.  Skinner Road sidewalk and road project. A project grant agreement was entered into with the State of CT and the Department of Transportation under the Local Bridge Program for the bridge on Bolton Road over the Tankerhoosen River for the Town to fund this project in the amount of 31.79% $178.876.00 of a $562,681.00 grant. Other projects that the Council supported were the reconstruction of Union Street, drainage improvements from Elm Street to Orchard Street, and the river restoration program. The need for preservation of open space was accomplished by designating 11.16 acres of land at Hockanum Crossing, one acre at Hatch Hill Road, and through the hard work of The Friends of Valley Falls, the purchase of the 10.2 acre parcel known as the ""Darico Parcel"" at the intersection of Valley Falls Road and Bolton Road was accomplished. The Vernon Historic Properties Study Committee recommended, and the Council accepted their report, to establish Valley Falls Farm, 346 Valley Falls Road, as a Local Historic Property in the Town of Vernon. An application for a grant to the State of Connecticut Local Capital Improvement Program was authorized in the Amount of $100,000.00 for the Valley Falls Barn nature Center  Phase III, and for an air chiller system at the Police Department; and an application for a grant in the amount of $120,000.00 for the repaving of Fire Stations Co. #1, Co# 2, Co. # 3 and Nye Street; installation/replacement of Skinner Road sidewalks; and the Town Hall exterior wall restoration was completed utilizing funds provided by the Connecticut Historical Commission. Several grant applications were filed to address the Town's concerns for the youth of the community. They include grants under: the Drug and Alcohol Awareness Grant program in the amount of $4,245.00; Peers are W onderful Support Grant in the amount of $59,978.00; and Youth Services Bureau Grant in the amount of $23,295.00.  3   During this fiscal year the following ordinances were adopted:  Ordinance to Amend Ordinance 217 and Vernon Town Code Sec. 12-8(8) Relative to Assignment of Tax Lien Procedures.  Ordinance Pertaining to Removal of Dog Feces within the Town of Vernon.  Ordinance Pertaining to the Control of Dogs within the Town of Vernon. The Council voted, however, to allow dogs to be off-leash in all of Vernon's parks (specifically excluding Board of Education property) from a half-hour before sunrise to 8:30 a.m.  year round.

The Town Council approved the appointment of Paul M. Shimer on January 2, 2001 to fill the vacancy on the Town Council created by the resignation of Claire L. Janowski for her unexpired term which concludes November 11, 2001. Mrs. Janowski was elected to serve as the Town of Vernon's State Representative in November 2000.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many volunteers who serve on our boards, committees and commissions. I am especially proud of the grass roots efforts to revitalize Rockville undertaken by members in the Neighborhood Revitalization Area and through the efforts of the Sixth  4   Street Committee Area Block watch and the Rockville Downtown Association. I am especially thankful to the residents of Vernon for your support. I have been extremely proud to serve as your Mayor. Sincerely,  Stephen C. Marcham, Mayor  5   Finance and Accounting Department Head: James M. Luddecke, Finance Officer and Treasurer Frank J. Zitkus, Controller Yvette Caron, Accountant Diane Luddecke, Budget Analyst Shirley Sacco, Payroll Coordinator Sharon Shea, Assistant Treasurer Town Hall Memorial Building, Room 304 Responsibilities and Duties The mission of the Finance Department is to institute and promote comprehensive financial management designed for the coordination, control, analysis and planning dedicated to the provisions of community services. Inherent in this resolve is the theory that ""good"" government can be defined by accountability, equity, and efficiency in the management of financial resources for the public benefit. To further this resolve is the adherence to legal, moral, and professional standards of conduct in the fulfillment of our responsibilities. Unlike a private business, which is accounted for as a single entity, accounting for a governmental unit is through separate fund and account group entities, each with its own balance sheet. Thus, from an accounting and financial management viewpoint, a governmental unit is a combination of several distinctly different fiscal and accounting entities, functioning independently of the other funds and account groups. The combined balance sheet for these funds and account groups will be found on the final pages of this report. The Finance Department of the Town is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the Town are protected from loss, theft, or misuse, and to ensure that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The internal control structure is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that: the cost of control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and; the evaluation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by management.  Department Location:  All internal control structure evaluations occur within the above framework. We believe that the Town's internal control structure adequately safeguards assets and provides reasonable assurance for the proper recording of financial transactions and for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the Finance Department is responsible for the following: To provide supporting documents and to assist in the preparation of the annual budget and; to establish budgetary  6   controls to ensure compliance with the legal provisions embodied in the annual appropriated budget for the General Fund and other adopted budgets. Project-length financial plans are maintained for the Special Revenue Funds and Capital Project Funds. Also, the Finance Department prepares the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report; coordinates the cash flow and investment of all Town funds; prepares the official statement for bond issues; manages debt service activity and structure; and manages and allocates resources for the capital improvement program; administers the pension fund, insurance and benefit programs, and purchasing programs; directs financial improvements to departments as necessary and; oversees activities in Tax Collection and Assessments. Independent Audit The Town Charter requires an annual audit of the books of account, financial records, and transactions of all administrative departments of the Town by independent certified public accountants selected by the Town Council. This requirement has been complied with and the auditors' report has been included in the report. Awards The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to the Town of Vernon for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. The Certificate of Achievement is a prestigious national award recognizing conformance with the highest standards for preparation of state and local government reports. In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, the Town of Vernon published an easily readable and efficiently organized CAFR, whose contents conform to program standards. The CAFR must satisfy both generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements. A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year only. Vernon has received a Certificate of Achievement for the last eight consecutive years. We believe that our current report continues to meet the Certificate of Achievement Program's requirements and we have submitted it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.  7   General Fund Revenues and Other Financing Sources June 30, 2001 % of Amount Total $ 35,562,024 20,184,903 1,252,905 307,417 775,737 390,710 58,473,696 60.41% 34.29% 2.13% 0.52% 1.32% 0.66% 99.32% June 30, 2000 % of Amount Total $ 34,575,134 19,743,318 1,329,057 231,530 758,796 317,894 56,955,729 60.33% 34.45% 2.32% 0.40% 1.32% 0.55% 99.38% $ Increase (Decrease) from 2000 Amount % 986,890 441,585 (76,152) 75,887 16,941 72,816 1,517,967 2.85% 2.24% -5.73% 32.78% 2.23% 22.91% 2.67%  Revenue Sources Property taxes Intergovermental Charges for services Interest on investments Licenses and permits Other revenues Total Revenues Other Financing Sources: Transfers in Total Revenues and Other Financing Sources  398,511 $ 58,872,207  0.68% 100.00%  358,042 $ 57,313,771  0.62% 100.00%  40,469 $ 1,558,436  11.30% 2.72%  G e n e r a l F u nd E xpe ndi t u r e s an d O t h e r F i n anc i n g U s e s June 30, 200 1 % of A m ount T ota l $ 2,134, 6 9 5 243,558 5,784, 8 5 2 4 ,022, 6 9 6 699,873 1,162, 0 3 0 3,677, 3 1 2 36,698,703 831,164 2 ,009, 8 9 5 57,264,778 3.60% 0.41% 9.77% 6.79% 1.18% 1.96% 6.21% 61.96% 1.40% 3.39% 96.68% $ J une 30, 200 0 % of A m o unt T o t al 2,214, 7 4 3 212,156 5,829, 3 0 1 3,599, 0 0 0 642,860 1,156, 1 7 9 3,344, 2 7 5 35,282,420 1,178, 7 4 1 2,114, 4 8 8 55,574,163 3.85% 0.37% 10.12% 6.25% 1.12% 2.01% 5.81% 61.26% 2.05% 3.67% 96.49% $ I n crea s e ( D ecre ase) f r om 2000 A m ount % ( 80, 0 4 8) 31,402 ( 44, 4 4 9) 423,696 57,013 5,851 333,037 1,416, 2 8 3 ( 347,577) ( 104,593) 1,690, 6 1 5 -3 .6 1 % 1 4 .8 0 % -0 .7 6 % 1 1 .7 7 % 8 .8 7 % 0 .5 1 % 9 .9 6 % 4 .0 1 % -2 9 .4 9 % -4 .9 5 % 3 .0 4 %  F u nc t ion G e ne r a l go ve r n m e nt C o m m unit y de ve lopm e n t Public Sa f e ty M a i n t e na nc e a nd D e ve lopm e n t H u m a n Se r v i c e s Pa r k s , r e c r e a ti o n , a nd c u ltu r e T o w n w i de E duc a tio n C a pita l O u tla y D e bt Se r v i c e T o ta l Expe ndi tu r e s O t he r Fi na nc ing U s e s : T r a n s f e r s out T o ta l E x pe ndi tu r e s a nd O the r Fina nc ing U s e s  1,965, 9 1 9 $ 59,230,697  3.32% 100.00%  2,021, 0 5 4 $ 57,595,217  3.51% 100.00%  ( 55, 1 3 5) $ 1,635, 4 8 0  -2 .7 3 % 2.84%  8   Economic Condition and Outlook The Town of Vernon is a residential community of 18.6 square miles located east of Hartford on Interstate 84 in north central Connecticut. Interstate 84 connects with I-90, I-384, I-91 and I291, which provide highway access to all areas of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York. The convenient access provided by Interstate 84 within the Greater Hartford area has contributed to Vernon's development as a residential suburban community and a commercial center for neighboring towns. Vernon's population for the year ended June 30, 2001, was 28,063 compared with 29,301 on June 30, 2000, a decrease of 1,238 or 0.1%. This decrease of 1,238 residents follows an increase in population of 32 or 0.1% during the previous one-year period. The April 2000 Census report of 28,063 residents is a net decrease of 1,778 or 6.3% from the April 1990 Census report. This change of population size has been attributable to less housing construction, smaller families, and an increase in the average age of residents. Also, several of the neighboring towns have made the transformation from rural to suburban areas and have experienced moderate population growth. However, recent approvals of residential subdivisions and the number of building permits issued for new residential construction in Vernon, suggest growth of approximately 1,250 persons over the next two years. Approximately 80% of Vernon's labor force is employed outside the town. On a regional basis, our residents' income is derived from major insurance firms, defense industries, financial institutions and capital goods production. The restructuring of these corporate employers and the decline of capital spending gave cause to higher unemployment rates in the beginning of the last decade, as high as 7.8% in 1992. In the past few years, employment in middle management and technical positions has stabilized and there have been increases in service areas of employment, including home-based consulting and technical services. During the past few years, employment opportunities have been expanding for Vernon residents, which were reflected in a considerable improvement of the unemployment rate. However, as of June 30, 2001, the rate increased to 2.6% as compared to 2.4% in 2000, 3.3% in 1999, and 4.0% in 1998. Economically, the slight increase in the unemployment rate is influenced by the current recession, and though there are inherent uncertainties with this type of downturn, the composure of the community's resources suggest that any increases in the near future will be modest. The economic base for Connecticut, as well as for Vernon, has had an overall change from that of manufacturing to retail commerce and professional services. Of the twenty-four firms in Vernon with fifty or more employees, 89% are employed in services while only 11% are employed in manufacturing and printing. Approximately 50% of this employment is with nonprofit and public organizations. The largest Vernon employer is the Town of Vernon, which has 886 employees. The second largest employer is Rockville General Hospital with 702 employees, followed by New England Mechanical Services, the largest commercial employer, with 441 employees. The fourth largest is Visiting Nurse and Community Care with 347 employees. Employment in Vernon businesses declined during the past year. The number of individuals employed by the top twenty-five companies decreased by 423 or 8.7%. A segment of the reduction is due to a refinement of the data to distinguish full-time and part-time. This affected  9   the employment data at the Reminder Press, a printing firm, with a decrease from 300 to 119, as well as Adams Super Food Store from 370 to 116. At Rockville General Hospital (RGH), there was an increase of 52 employees. Amerbelle Corporation, which is a textile finisher employing 225, increased by 5 positions, but is presently experiencing a slowdown and has announced that layoffs are imminent. New England Mechanical Services, which is both an HVAC installer and service maintenance provider, had an increase of 31 positions in 2001 and has opened two satellite offices. The national trend of downsizing and rehiring employees on a part-time basis tends to mask the indicators and creates a socioeconomic impact that requires careful examination as our economic development plans are designed and evaluated. One element of this trend with relevance to Vernon is that the anticipated growth of home-based employment will influence a need for more flexibility in our zoning regulations and also place demands on our local telecommunications provider to update their facilities to a state-of-the-art infrastructure. The Town of Vernon generally shares the same economic health as the State of Connecticut and the Hartford region, therefore experiencing the economic slowdown that the region is enduring. The recent stabilization of real estate values and the emergence of small-scale entrepreneurial activities are beginning to have a positive influence on Vernon's economy. The State of Connecticut is constructing a new football stadium in East Hartford for the University of Connecticut and will proceed with the development of a convention center in Hartford. These endeavors, along with a myriad of planned development in the city and along the Connecticut River, forecast an enhanced prosperity for the Greater Hartford economy, of which is Vernon is a part. Vernon completed a town wide statistical revaluation of property as of October 1, 2000, which was effective for the 2001-02 fiscal year. Our tax base for the October 1, 2000 grand list grew by 3.77%, inclusive of a 3.62% increase in the real estate portion. In past years, the growth in the real estate portion has been hindered by tax appeals to the 1991 revaluation and the reduction of assessments to the old mill properties. The Town is nearing completion of the October 1, 2001 grand list and we anticipate growth from real estate development of approximately 1.13%. The increase would provide $347,000 more in tax revenue for programs and services. Property taxes have been supported by strong collection rates, averaging 97.9% over the past ten years. The number of building permits decreased from 1,737 to 1,537 and the value of those permits decreased from $18,285,121 to $16,299,614. The local economic base serves the region as a commercial, governmental, legal, and medical center. Local employment in manufacturing has been replaced by employment in these service areas. This shift is revealed in the additions to the tax base as planned development and new construction are related to retail commerce and professional services. The economic areas for new development are downtown Rockville, Vernon Circle, Lafayette Square, the I-84 corridor, and the Gerber Farm area. Rockville Section: The former Rockville mills section has made a transition from being primarily an industrial and commercial center to being a professional and governmental center. It is the site of local government, education, and State of Connecticut administrative offices. The initial development of downtown Rockville occurred over one hundred years ago, creating its distinctive Victorian  10   urban character and invaluable architecture. However, this also creates the need for reinvestment and modernization. The latest renovations of the school administration building and the senior center, late nineteenth century structures, rehabilitation of the Juvenile Court, and the State of Connecticut Geographic Area #19 Courthouse, are modernization projects that have retained business activity in Rockville. The State of Connecticut is negotiating with the owner of property adjacent to GA #19 for possible renovations to create an enlarged Juvenile Court facility. The building is only 50% occupied due to functional obsolescence. The Town has acquired the Citizens Block, a vacant commercial and mixed use 1879 building, adjacent to the 1867 senior center building. We have obtained certification that the Citizens Block is eligible to investors for historic preservation tax credits of up to 30% of the cost to rehabilitate. The Town expended $498,912 to restore the Memorial Building - Town Hall third and fourth floor `tall' windows with replicas of the originals. The building was constructed in 1888, and 26 years ago the windows had been cemented to prevent water leaks. Though this repair solved the problem, it created an architectural eyesore. There is great interest in the community to revitalize the downtown Rockville section and the Town is advancing that endeavor by restoring its own buildings. An additional $70,490 was utilized to recondition the exterior wall. Interior renovations of the building are scheduled to begin in the spring of 2002. The Town Council has approved the design of the third floor and has identified funding in the amount of $575,000. A Historic Preservation grant in the amount of $7,500, along with town funds of $7,492, removed the plywood covering and replaced the upper windows of the Senior Center. During the past year, the Public Works department restored interior spiral staircase of the Center's tower. They also renovated the first floor of 55 West Main Street, the former G.A. #19 courthouse, allowing the Building Inspection department and Fire Marshal to relocate there. Plans are being prepared to renovate the second floor and move the departments of Planning, Community and Economic Development, and Engineering from Town Hall. The prospect is for the building to serve as a one-stop Community Development Center. The second floor of the Memorial Building is also home to the New England Civil War Museum, which has refurbished their stained glass windows and has made plans to expand its library. The Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) hall, opened in 1890, is still fully intact with the most identified collection of relics in Connecticut. Along with the Civil War items and anthology, the museum acts as the repository for the Sons of Union Veterans, the Women's Relief Corps, and the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. The museum has recently expanded their hours open to the public, increasing the flow of people into the Rockville section. Rockville General Hospital (RGH) is in close proximity to the government buildings and courthouses, which make it a primary factor in Rockville's future. Eastern Connecticut Health Network (ECHN), the holding corporation of RGH, has made preparations for a $20 million renovation and addition in order to expand the hospital's desire to capture a greater share of the eastern Connecticut market for health services. This part of the state is realizing some of the fastest growth in Connecticut. ECHN has completed the construction of a kidney dialysis center on Hartford Turnpike (Route 30) in the Vernon section of town. Retail activity in Rockville remains in flux. The Town has retained an architect to design a uniform facade and sign treatment for the storefronts on West Main Street opposite Central Park and the Town Hall. Ano-Coil, a manufacturer of anodized aluminum and lithographic plates, and owner of a vacant three-story office building, has made a proposal to the Town for  11   acquisition of the structure. A feasibility study is being done as to the future use of the building. The Rockville Public Library, across from the hospital, is preparing plans to renovate and expand the building. Four new businesses have opened in formerly vacant stores, Brewed Awakenings Caf; Grammas Kitchen; A Buck or Two, and Moonbeams Gift Shop. The Town initiated the organization of a ""Rockville Neighborhood Revitalization Zone (NRZ)"" to create neighborhood-based planning, strengthen grant applications, and stimulate private investment. The Town provided funding to assist in the establishment of the NRZ. Vernon submitted a successful application for designation as a ""Main Street"" community and is entering the second year of the program. The Rockville section is one of thirteen participants in the Connecticut Main Street Program and there are 1,633 communities involved nationwide. The Town has provided a grant of $40,000 each year to the Rockville Downtown Association for the hiring of a Main Street Coordinator. By its participation, Vernon endorses the goal of economic revitalization for the Rockville downtown area within the context of the preservation and rehabilitation of its historic buildings. In September of 2001, a team of five Main Street consultants met with all sections of the community over a four-day period. They prepared a comprehensive review of current revitalization efforts, strategic planning outlines for future projects, and goals encompassing a broadened long-term strategy for continued success in the revitalization program. Vernon Circle: The Vernon Circle area has made a positive adjustment to the new regional shopping center development in the Buckland Hills section of Manchester, just one highway exit west on I-84. The Tri-City Plaza, renovated seven years ago, has a very successful retail mix of value-oriented stores. At the K-Mart Plaza, the recent 68,000 square foot Super Stop & Shop, 22,000 square foot Sears Hardware, and 99 Restaurant have been doing well. At the site of the former supermarket space, three discount specialty stores have recently opened. Damon's Restaurant closed and the space has not been made available for lease. A new Bennigan's Restaurant was constructed and opened on December 15, 2000. The Town previously owned a portion of the land on which the restaurant is located. A new Auto Zone store has been built. Two gas stations have closed, but the sites are being remedied in anticipation of new development. Doctors' offices and medical services have moved into the vacancy at Vernon Commons, which is adjacent to the ECHN Dialysis Center. Completion of the recent development has strengthened the Vernon Circle area overall. There is a clear pattern that as the vacancies in Vernon Circle become occupied, the available space on the periphery is being filled and is becoming more attractive for extended development.  Lafayette Square: The Lafayette Square commercial area has been experiencing steady development. Of the available retail and office space, just three offices remain vacant at 30 Lafayette Square. Three years ago, Theo's Restaurant expanded and made extensive renovations. They have just recently completed another addition and further remodeled the establishment. Tolland Bank built a new branch and leased adjoining office space to a law firm. Three former residential properties have been purchased and converted to commercial offices. A proposal for an assisted living elderly  12   housing project, with 100 units has been approved for Hartford Turnpike (Route 30), west of Lafayette Square. I-84 Corridor: The I-84 corridor offers potential for office park development around the interchanges. A travel service center proposed for the parcel between I-84 and 30 Lafayette Square was rejected by the Inland Wetlands Commission (IWC). A new Burger King has been built on Reservoir Road (Route 31) at I-84, exit #67. W.S. Development has an option for forty-two acres at this intersection and has obtained a zone change to allow for mixed-use development. A developer has obtained approval for 18 age-restricted units at the twenty-five acre site on Whitney Ferguson Road at I-84, exit 66 and construction has begun. A developer requested a zone change at Key Note Drive for a Home Depot, but it was denied by the Planning and Zoning Commission (PZC) due to a potential negative impact on the adjacent residential neighborhood. Home Depot is exploring other sites along the I-84 corridor in Vernon. Forty acres on South Frontage Road are under option for development. Recognizing the economic development potential of I-84, the Town has been marketing these and other sites with an ""I-84 Corridor"" and ""Vernon: Crossroads for Opportunity"" marketing campaign. Gerber Farm: A bridge for the new Hockanum Boulevard has been constructed. The bridge provides access to the approximately 275-acre Gerber Farm area for development. The PZC adopted the area as a Mixed Use Development (MUD) district. This allows for mixed-use development based upon a comprehensive plan and an economic fiscal impact analysis, that demonstrates a net positive tax revenue for the Town. Gardner L. Chapman was granted approval for a 424-luxury rental unit complex, the Mansions at Hockanum Crossing, and three industrial buildings amounting to 64,000 square feet. Construction is underway with approximately 70 units completed, estimated at an assessed value of $60,000 per unit. When the rental project is complete, the total assessment is estimated at $24 million. This gated community has an indoor swimming pool, business center, and health club. The grounds are appointed with waterfalls, ponds, and walking trails. Also along Hockanum Boulevard, a new industrial condominium project has been constructed and is being offered to the public. State and Federal funds have been approved for the signalization and widening of Wilshire Road and Route 83, and project completion is scheduled for April of 2002. The first phase of Quail Hollow, an age-restricted housing project of 68 units is complete and the developer has applied for the construction of additional units. Mill Properties Industrial development has proven to be the most difficult economic challenge for municipalities in Connecticut as manufacturers leave the state and available employment declines. The decline of industry in Vernon relates to the lack of industrial land and the obsolescence of existing facilities, as well as to the general diminishing of manufacturing employment. With only 8.3% of the town zoned for commercial and industrial use, the town is aggressively pursuing the availability of large parcels of land for industrial development while facing the additional task of addressing the redevelopment of older mill properties. The Saxony Mill was destroyed by fire on July 25, 1994. The Town has completed demolition and site remediation in preparation for the foreclosure and eventual sale or alternative use of the property. The Town has successfully petitioned the Connecticut Department of Transportation (DOT) to create a four-way intersection  13   and signalization contiguous to the site. This project, estimated at $365,000 and funded entirely by DOT, will enhance the commercial viability of the site. There are three other former mill properties that are vacant or underutilized. In response to this problem, the Town provided $15,000 for start-up costs associated with the formation of the Hockanum Industrial Development & Venture Corporation (HIDVC). This is a non-profit organization with a goal of re-energizing plants into viable entities. They have the capability to acquire, do remediation work, redevelop, manage, and market distressed non-residential properties. The Talcott Mill, which was purchased five years ago by an investment group, has increased the number of tenants and has paid the delinquent property taxes. The Town received a grant from the Connecticut Historical Commission and conducted a pre-development and preservation study of the Hockanum Mill, with the intention to restore the facility to productive use. The Town appointed a receiver to collect rents and manage the complex, a century old wooden structure. The Town also provided a business loan to Wiretek, Inc. to start a manufacturing operation in a part of the complex and has loaned $315,000 of Community Development Block Grant funds to the receiver to weatherize a portion of the complex, install an elevator, and make the necessary renovations to code violations. Vacant space in the building is being leased to the four existing businesses currently renting at the Hockanum Mill. Presently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is conducting a Brownfield Targeted Site Assessment, and if the study reveals only incidental environmental issues, the HIDVC will consider acquisition of the property. The Town is currently discussing funding options with the Connecticut Redevelopment Agency for the revitalization of the 145,000 square foot mill, by means of an initial grant of $1.5 million supported by tax increment financing. The abandoned Roosevelt Mills continues to remain inactive, which has also hindered the leasing of the mill property across the road. The EPA has provided a ""Brownfield Target Assessment Study"" of the site. A previous fire at the site caused the Town to expend $55,410 for cleanup and demolition costs. The EPA partially reimbursed Vernon with a grant of $26,553. An Urgent Planning grant from the State of Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development was approved in the amount of $50,000. This grant has been utilized to conduct a structural engineering study to determine the feasibility of rehabbing the building. The study was completed and because the structure is not as strong as initially presumed, the recommendation is to demolish the building for site re-development. The Environmental Research Institute (ERI) of the University of Connecticut has developed a new methodology for the soil cleanup of dry cleaning fluid. Vernon officials conferred with ERI to commence plans for a demonstration project at the Roosevelt Mills site. The Town has been awarded a Special Projects  Economic Initiative grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in the amount of $498,900 that will fund a site characterization study and a site evaluation study. If the results of the studies are successful, this new methodology will become the standard across the country. The Town also has received notice from the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development of an additional $500,000 award for remediation and cleanup.  14   The Town approved $32,059 to fund the preparation of a Hazard Mitigation Plan. The plan was completed in 2001 and appraises the flood and erosion issues of the community. This plan enables the Town to be eligible for Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance concerning wetland management activity, inclusive of reparations for culverts, bridges, and dams, as well as land acquisition. In 1998, the Town Council adopted a resolution that established an Economic Development Reserve Fund. Sources of funding come from budgetary appropriations, surplus funds, and grants. Disbursement of funds is based upon projects identified in the three-year economic development plan, as prepared by the Economic Development Commission. The initial funding in 1999 of $70,000 was followed by budget appropriations of $60,000 in both 2000 and 2001, and $75,000 for 2002. Funds have been used for the I-84 development site marketing campaign; to design retail-commercial facades on West Main Street; for the organization of the Neighborhood Revitalization Zone; the hiring of the Main Street Program Coordinator; the creation of the Hockanum Industrial Development Corporation; and for a study for the rehabilitation or reuse of properties. Funding of $81,945 was authorized to hire a firm to prepare the ""2000 Plan of Conservation and Development"". The Plan is expected to be complete by the end of 2001. The economic indicators for the nation and the state suggest that the economy remains soft and has entered into a recession after a ten-year period of unprecedented growth. Long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable, but current increases in unemployment and the projected constraints on state and local spending, counter economic stimuli. Successful pursuit of the economic development cited will enable Vernon to take advantage of the gradual business expansion and demand for developmental sites, thus greeting the future with a tax base strengthened by these objectives. Major Initiatives The Town has given considerable attention to capital improvements, and the year ended June 30, 2001, was no exception. The wastewater treatment facility, in its fourth year of operation since a major expansion and upgrade, establishes an advanced treatment process capable of providing effective, efficient and reliable treatment well into this century's second decade, protecting the natural ecology of the river and preserving its aesthetic and recreational values for future generations. As well as from Vernon, the treatment facility accepts sanitary wastes from portions of the surrounding towns of Tolland, Ellington, Manchester and South Windsor in accordance with the provisions of intergovernmental sewer agreements between each of those communities and the Town of Vernon. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), in cooperation with the State of New York and the EPA, has been investigating water quality problems in Long Island Sound. Their studies have shown that the largest controllable form of pollution is the nitrogen discharged from sewage treatment plants. A plan has been established with a goal of an overall 63% nitrogen reduction over the next 15 years. The DEP is also establishing a nitrogen trading program, which will allow those treatment plants that can significantly reduce nitrogen to sell credits to those that are currently unable to do so. The Town needs to have a feasibility study done to determine the best process alternative to accomplish this goal and a cost estimate for design and construction. State Clean Water Funding  15   (CWF) is available for 55% of the study and 35% for construction. The Town is presently considering its options and preparing an assessment of cost attributable to surrounding communities that utilize the Vernon wastewater treatment plant. Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds were received in the amount of $400,000 for a small business loan program, that enabled the Town to issue non-interest loans. Renovations at the Hockanum Mills of $315,417 have been financed through this program. Other CDBG funds provided $78,000 for elderly transit services provided by the Hockanum Valley Community Council; and $35,820 for the Roosevelt Mills Market Reuse and Feasibility study. This study recommended the best uses for the building and is the prerequisite for obtaining a $500,000 state grant for site remediation. In the summer of 1998, a venting pipe at the Skinner Road School was accidentally severed and approximately 10,000 gallons of heating oil leaked into the ground. The Town took immediate action and the oil recovered is presently over 50% and the diffusion has been suspended. The DEP has agreed with the Town to employ a bio-sparging system of remediation. This system is in place and the project is expected to be complete by July of 2003. The estimated expense is $604,445, of which, $303,170 was provided through the education budget to cover 1999 expenditures, and the general government budget is funding the remaining costs. As of June 30, 2001, the total amount expended was $503,265. The final payment associated with ordinance number 167, for sewer renovations and extensions, was made in the amount of $229,150 for the replacement of the Snipsic Street sewer line. This project was done contiguous with the State of Connecticut road widening and improvement project. Other projects included sewer line renovations at Bancroft Street, East Street, East Main Street, Brooklyn Street, Daily Circle, the Hockanum trunk line, and various infiltration and inflow undertakings. The total bond authorization was $6,500,000, of which $5,239,351 of bonds and Clean Water Fund notes were issued. Grants and sewer assessments helped to offset the balance of total expenditures amounting to $5,743,041. In the southwest part of Hartford Turnpike (Route 30), the Town owns a sanitary sewer trunk that serves as an interceptor for five (5) pumping stations. In June of 1999, the adjacent sewer line collapsed due to corrosion within the pipe and 2,400 feet was replaced or relined. The emergency repair cost spread over two fiscal years and amounted to $478,204. In October of 2001, a 234-foot section of pipe along the Rails-to-Trails path required emergency replacement at a cost of $77,786. Funding for both projects came from the sewer connection account, which in the past has funded sewer maintenance. Further inspection has revealed that approximately 3,700 feet of the trunk will need to be repaired. Mindful that there are 87.88 miles of sewer lines in the town and that the sewer connection account is limited as to the funding required to accomplish multiple projects such as these, discussions are currently being held to develop a long-term financing plan for repairing the sewers. In October of 1999, the DEP issued orders to both Vernon and Bolton to implement the recommendations of wastewater management studies for the Middle and Lower Bolton Lake areas. DEP has provided 100% funding for both studies, with the first study amounting to $143,092. The second study, in its final stages, is expected to cost $240,620. To date, both  16   studies have recommended sewers for the area as the most reliable, long-term solution for wastewater disposal. The recommended plan is estimated to cost $13.5 million. Both towns are working with the State of Connecticut to allow for the option of forming a regional water pollution control district for the Bolton Lakes area. The regional concept would be the first of its kind and may qualify for additional grant funding. Currently, the project is eligible for a 20% Clean Water Fund grant and an 80% low interest loan. A meeting is scheduled in January of 2002 to further determine the course of action. The Town continues to address major rolling stock demands in an effort to replace equipment and vehicles that have met their useful life. Besides being better equipped to serve the residents of Vernon, a favorable result of this effort is the reduction to overall maintenance budgets for the subsequent year. Utilizing the capital budget and identified reserves, $779,243 was expended or encumbered for the purchase of public works trucks and equipment, a fire rescue truck, a fire pumper truck, a truck for the recreation department, and a senior center bus. As a future initiative, an appropriation of $605,000 has been approved for 2001-2002 major rolling stock acquisitions. In the public safety area, a Local Law Enforcement Block Grant of $13,010 funded improvements at the police department to upgrade the security system in the cellblocks and adjoining area, inclusive of installing new audio and video devices. Another upgrade to current technology was the replacement of the fourteen-year-old Dictaphone recording system by a digital recording system at a cost of $25,434. A Local Capital Improvement (LoCIP) grant from the State of Connecticut in the amount of $55,200 was awarded to upgrade the heating and cooling system at the police station. Of that amount, $37,347 has been expended and the project will be completed in January of 2002. Another LoCIP grant in the amount of $63,000 was awarded to repave the parking lots at four of the five fire stations. The ambulance services account is in the Special Revenue Fund and $150,000 has been reserved to periodically replace each of the two ambulances. In subsequent years, $20,000 per year of ambulance fees collected will be reserved for this purpose. The fire department's 132 members, the largest volunteer force in the state, enables the town to apply the savings from personnel costs to equipment needs. Although the members are not employees, the Town has recognized their commitment to protecting the lives and property of our residents, and has established a Length of Service Award Program (LOSAP). This is a non-qualified employer retirement plan that commenced on January 1, 2000. To attain normal retirement, a minimum of ten years of credited service is required, with maximum credited service of thirty years. The Town made its initial employer contribution of $93,373 to an investment fund set up exclusively for this program and the second installment of $87,047 is due on December 31, 2001. Presently there are four members receiving benefits. The maximum benefit is $2,880 per year. The public works department continued to maintain and upgrade all town buildings. $551,984 has been appropriated for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) renovation program. Expenditures to date are $318,111. In the past year, $466,949 was expended for road repair, repaving, and sidewalk replacement. The State of Connecticut Town Aid for Roads program provided $231,738 of that amount, with the remainder coming from the capital improvement budget. There is an additional $198,688 reserved at June 30, 2001, to complete the Skinner Road and sidewalk project. In fiscal year 2001-2002, $25,000 has been budgeted for sidewalk  17   replacement and $200,000 of the Town Aid grant has been approved for repaving. Other major road projects include Bolton Road safety improvements, funded at $150,000. The Town is responsible for 15% and the remainder is to be funded under the federal Hazard Elimination component of the Surface Transportation grant. The design is complete and the project has received a construction bid of $185,000, requiring the pursuit of additional funds; the Union Street reconstruction and drainage improvement project is estimated at $4,000,000 and is 100% state funded. The project will be divided into two phases, from Elm Street to Orchard Street, and from Orchard Street of Maple Street. The design of the first phase is completed and work is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2003; designs have been completed for the reconstruction and widening of Vernon Avenue, from South Street to Hartford Turnpike. The estimated cost is $1,500,000 and federal and state grants will provide 90% of the funding. A salt and sand storage facility was constructed during the year and funding of $221,608 came from the State Bond Commission. Beginning on July 1, 2000, the public works department began a new program to collect and dispose the solid waste of 17 condominium complexes. For the initial year, the condominium associations agreed to pay the Town the amount they would have paid to a private contractor. The one-time payment of $122,957 offset the purchase cost of $147,468 for a new front-loading refuse truck. The Town has been providing recycling services to condominiums since 1994. Funding of $260,000 has been approved to develop engineering designs for the replacement of the Spring Street Bridge and River Street Bridge. An 80% grant from the federal Highway Planning and Construction fund and a 20% grant from the State Local Bridge Program provide the necessary funds for the designs. At the end of the year, $72,238 has been expended. Designs have been completed at a cost of $56,282 for the reconstruction of the Bolton Road and Phoenix Street bridges, both over the Tankerhoosen River. The estimated cost for both bridges is $1,030,000, and state grant funding of 31.79% is available. Reconstruction costs for the Vernon Avenue bridge, over the Hockanum River, is estimated at $200,000 and is eligible for a state grant of $74,590. The funding for the non-grant portion of each bridge, will be provided through the capital improvement program or a town improvement bond. The Town has received a state grant in the amount of $195,000 to restore the stream habitat, water quality, and aesthetics of the Hockanum River. Work will be completed in fiscal year 2003. Recreation programs remain very popular with our residents as demand and participation increases. The town has 569 acres dedicated to recreation, which consist of 23 parks, 35 miles of trails, two pools, and two beaches. The department is also responsible for maintaining the athletic fields throughout the public school system. During the past ten years, exclusive of open space acquisitions, over $3,500,000 have been allocated to improvements to those facilities. A program to address ADA improvements continues as $35,000 has been approved for Camp Newhoca and Valley Falls Park. A cold storage facility to shelter parks and maintenance vehicles was constructed during the year, with the necessary funding of $84,941 coming from the State Bond Commission. A Connecticut Urban Acts Program grant has provided $152,000 for restoring the pond at Valley Falls Park. The project's scope is to dredge the pond, install drainage, and landscape the surrounding area. A $20,000 National Recreation Trail grant permitted the Town to complete the Rockville Spur segment of the 9.5-mile Rails-to-Trails project. Total cost for this section amounted to $43,635. At the Dart Hill Park, a state CWF grant in the amount of $46,185 has been awarded to restore riverine functions by enhancing  18   recreational opportunities at the park with trails and furnishings. $45,000 has been allocated for the third phase of renovations to the Valley Falls Nature Barn. Funding from the Ruth Talcott Britton Trust Fund was approved to replace the two Henry Park tennis courts and the eight tennis courts at Rockville high school. The project was completed in September of 2001 at a total cost of $248,400. The Town was awarded a $200,000 Northeast Utilities Energy Conservation grant to conduct an energy conservation/community outreach program and to demonstrate the compatibility of energy conservation and historic preservation. The third floor renovation project at the Town Hall will serve as the prototype. The grant allowed the Town to hire an Energy Conservation Outreach Officer who has opened an office to the public. The Town also supports the Board of Education capital improvement plan in several ways. A reserve for capital and non-recurring expenditures account has been established that allows the school system, with approval from the Town Council, to place the unused portion of their operating budget at the end of the fiscal year into the account. Those funds are to be used to satisfy projects listed on their capital improvement plan. In 2000-2001, a single budget was approved combining the general government and education allocations for capital improvements, with $257,000 dedicated to school projects. In the year ended June 30, 2001, a world language lab was constructed at the high school, utilizing $100,000 of the capital improvement budget. At the Vernon Center Middle School, a computer wiring infrastructure project was completed at a cost of $69,689; and a technology grant of $107,510 has been approved to wire the Maple Street School. The reconstruction of the high school football field and track was completed in October of 2001 for a total cost of $439,768. This project, adjacent to the newly built tennis courts, combines to form an outstanding facility for the entire community. The Vocational Agriculture Center at the high school, has received a facility improvement project grant of $247,500 from the State of Connecticut that commenced in 2001. A capital improvement budget of $162,000 was approved for fiscal year 2001-2002, including funding for a photography laboratory, new bleachers at the football field, asbestos tile removal, and ventilation improvements. A review committee was established to recommend plans for the upgrade of the Lake Street School well. After discussing the matter with state officials, in October of 2001, the State Bond Commission approved $500,000 to extend a water main to the school and surrounding area. Project designs are currently being developed. Recognizing that land is a valuable resource and is important to the general welfare of town residents, the Town Council on May 2, 2000, approved an ordinance establishing a Reserve for Land Acquisition and Preservation. Beginning in fiscal year 2001-2002, the Reserve is to be maintained with a minimum balance of $10,000. In the year ended June 30, 2000, the Town participated in the Connecticut Open Space and Watershed Land Acquisition program, receiving state funding approval to purchase two parcels of land. Participating in the program places a permanent conservation easement on the property designated as open space. For the year ended June 30, 2001, the Town assisted the Friends of Valley Falls (Friends), a non-profit organization, with a payment of $100,000 for the purchase of the Valley Falls Farm, a 10.2-acre site with a farmhouse and six outbuildings, located at the corner of Bolton Road and Valley Falls Road. The payment represents 25% of the cost, with another 25% coming from community fund-  19   raising, and the remaining 50% from the Connecticut Open Space program. The title of the site, referred to as the Darico parcel, is held by the Friends, and they will manage and plan community activities. The Town receives interest in the property via a conservation easement, and the community preserves a unique landmark site, that will also provide environmental and historical points of reference for generations to come. We will continue to revise the six-year capital improvement plan to address community demands, understanding that the budgetary constraints imposed by varied economic climates requires the diligent pursuit of grants and alternative resources to fund capital needs. On February 6, 2001, the Town Council approved the recommendation of a special task force, to formalize the separation of capital improvements and debt service from both operating budgets. Administratively, we are currently refining the financial system with the utilization of technology and new computer and software systems which will improve our ability for comprehensive financial analysis vital to the decision making process. The new computer system, inclusive of the school administration, began full operation on July 1, 1999, and is becoming further integrated as we proceed. The offices of Collector of Revenue and the Assessor are in the process of converting their software applications into the same system as the finance department, with a completion date scheduled in May of 2002. The 2001-2002 operating budget, which included a tax increase of 0.64 mils, was approved by the Town Council and sent to the annual town meeting for adoption. The budget was instead petitioned to a referendum vote, and on the third referendum held on June 14, 2001, the voters adopted the budget. This was the second consecutive mil increase, and just the fourth over the past nine years. During that nine-year period the total increase in mils was 2.7 or 9.63%. We will continue to provide the voters with information to make knowledgeable decisions, as we have a responsibility to educate our residents on the programs and services presently provided, as well as those proposed.  20   EXHIBIT A  TOWN OF VERNON, CONNECTICUT COMBINED BALANCE SHEET -

Nocera, Jr., Ph.D. Amarjit S. Buttar, Chairperson; John Ward, Vice Chairperson; Carroll Burke, Susan Norlie-Hesnan, Leonard Jacobs, Thomasina Russell, Peggy Jackle, David Kemp, Mary Rittlinger The authority, the duties and the responsibilities of the Board have been established by the Connecticut statutes, federal laws, and the town charter. The Board of Education scheduled regular meetings on the second and fourth Mondays of each month with the exception of July, August and December when it met only once. In addition, Board committees met throughout the year to deal with budget, policy, facilities and negotiations. The following is a list of the five elementary schools and in parenthesis is the October 1, 2000 enrollment for each school: ! Center Road School (540) ! Lake Street School (330) ! Maple Street School (404) ! Northeast School (329) ! Skinner Road School (355) ! All elementary schools contain grades K-5. In addition, Center Road School also has a systemwide preschool program for students with special needs. The October 1, 2000 elementary school enrollment was 1958. There are three schools that enroll students in grades 6-12. ! ! ! Vernon Center Middle School (963) accommodates students in grades 6-8. Rockville High School (1198) accommodates students in grades 912. Talcottville School (17) is a day treatment facility that provides a program for grades 6-12 special need students who require a more restrictive environment than either Vernon Center Middle School or Rockville High School can provide.  School Data:  The October 1, 2000 enrollment for grades 6-12 was 2178. The total enrollment for the district was 4136. 34   The total budget for the 2000-2001 school year was $36,540,923. Teacher Evaluation During the 2000-2001 school year a representative committee of teachers and administrators completed the task of revising Vernon's Teacher Evaluation Plan to insure consistency with new State Teachers' Evaluation Guidelines. A key change in the plan established a greater link between effective teaching and improved student learning. In addition, the plan provides an opportunity for tenured teachers to pursue an in-depth professional growth activity in their third and fourth year of each four-year evaluation cycle. Student Achievement ! On the Connecticut Mastery Test (CMT) the percentage of students meeting state goals in the areas of reading for grades 4, 6 and 8; writing in grades 6 and 8; and math in grades 4, 6 and 8 exceeded both the education reference group and state averages. On the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) average scores for both verbal and mathematics exceeded reference group and state averages. On the Connecticut Academic Performance Test (CAPT), the percentage of tenth grade Vernon students scoring at or above state goal met or exceeded educational reference group and state average in all of the four areas tested. Over a multiple-year basis there is an upward trend in average achievement in standardized testing measures on CMT, CAPT and SAT. On Connecticut Physical Fitness Testing the percent of Vernon students passing all four tests administered in grades 4, 6, 8, and 10 exceeded reference group and state averages. On the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, an academic achievement test, Vernon students are consistently above the national average in all areas. For the program year 2000, Rockville High School ranked 17th out of 144 Connecticut public high schools participating in the Advanced Placement Program (AP) and is second in rank within educational Reference Group F.  !  !  !  !  !  !  35   Professional Development A total of 64 professional development activities were run on August 28, 2000, November 7, 2000, March 16, 2001 and June 25, 2001. A number of activities were continuous, spanning more than one day. For example, the elementary activity Improving Reading/Writing Instruction Grades 1-5 and the K-12 activity Improving Art Instruction began on August 28, 2000 and concluded on November 7, 2000. The theme of ""Student Achievement"" carried over on four of the four in-service days at all grade levels. Several additional professional development activities were provided apart from those scheduled on the regular in-service days. During the summer of 2000, our administrative staff participated in a one-day in-service session on the topic Overview of New Connecticut Guidelines for Teacher Evaluation and Professional Development and the Common Core of Teaching. Funding from the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund Grant and the Comprehensive School Reform grant provided four full days of in-service for Maple Street School staff on the topic of Waterford Early Reading Program. Additionally, through funding received by Maple Street School's Goals 2000 Grant, five pull-out days were provided for Maple Street School teachers on the topic Meeting the Goals of the Connecticut Mastery Test in Mathematics. A full-day workshop funded through the Route 3/83 Technologies Consortium grant was held this past spring. This workshop, attended by various Vernon Center Middle School teachers, dealt with the topic of Software Review. In addition, multiple-day sessions were offered after school on various topics such as Running Records. Furthermore, teachers in all of the schools have been provided on-site training in a variety of computer based instructional skills and technical areas. Curriculum Development During the summer of 2000, a number of curriculum development workshops were conducted. These workshops resulted in the revision and updating of curriculum guides for the following areas: two high school art courses; a high school English course; elementary reading/language arts; five high school family and consumer science courses, three high school math courses; one middle school math course; elementary math; middle school and high school physical education; two high school science courses; and a middle school science course. Annual Social Studies Fair The Fourth Annual Social Studies Fair on March 23 and 24 was a very 36   successful event again. There were 341 projects displayed and 426 students participated. An increased number of parents and guests came to view the fair. The Nathan Hale Fife and Drum Corp performed and people in period costumes attended. Ribbons, certificates and prizes were given to the participating students. Arts The Art Program delivers instruction to Vernon students in Grades K-12, while employing its curriculum that demonstrates compatibility with the National Arts Standards and the CT Arts Curriculum Frameworks. Rockville High School's Art Department continues curriculum revision for each of its 13 art course offerings to guarantee the department's delivery of systematic, developmental, sequential, ongoing curriculum to all Vernon students. The art program was pleased to announce an expansion to its services during the 2000-01 school year, as the kindergarten students are now taught art from the art specialist and there is an increase in art instruction time at the other elementary grades. Rockville High School has completed its first year as a participant of the Connecticut Commission on the Arts' HOT (Higher Order Thinking) Schools Program. The statewide program that includes 26 schools promotes Higher Order Thinking Skills for students in and through the arts and interdisciplinary teaching and learning. RHS will receive extensive services that include artist residencies, professional development and technical support as they develop and implement their model over the next five years. Vernon students' achievements and accomplishments in the visual arts were presented publicly. The Rockville Public Library continues to confirm its commitment to the arts and community partnership by hosting an extensive Vernon student art exhibit, grades K-12, during March, which is Youth Art Month, in the Edith Peck Room of the library. The Friends of the Rockville Library sponsored and hosted a reception for the exhibitors and their families, which was extremely well attended by the community. Vernon was highlighted once again at the Tolland County Art Association annual student art exhibit, held in May, at the Tolland Public Library. An extensive collection of Vernon students' art work from grades K-12 was exhibited along with other students' work from Tolland County school districts. Vernon's annual Day in the Park, held locally at Henry Park, embraced the visual arts by demonstrating its students' outstanding works through a broad display of art works produced during the school year from various art classes throughout the district. Children were afforded the opportunity to showcase their talents in a sidewalk chalk art event. 37   Several Vernon students were recognized for outstanding accomplishments and achievements in visual arts through awards and recognition programs. This was a particularly exciting year for Vernon's participation in the annual Fire Prevention Poster Contest, as the poster of one of our Grade 5 students was selected as the statewide winner. It will become the official State Poster for Fire Prevention Week, 2001! A total of six elementary students were winners in the local Fire Prevention Poster Contest, and one of them went on to become a Tolland County winner. Seven students from VCMS and RHS had their visual arts works juried into the annual Connecticut Scholastic Art Awards statewide student competition for grades 7-12. Nine Grade 5 students received arts awards for outstanding achievements in the performing and visual arts from the Connecticut Association of Schools. The students and their families were honored at two separate awards banquets hosted by the Connecticut Association of Schools. All of these students were recognized at a special ceremony during a Board of Education meeting in April. Music The students in the Rockville High School music department participated in many performances throughout the year. The Marching Band hosted its Eighth Annual Festival of Bands with eleven marching bands from Connecticut and Massachusetts competing. The Marching Band and Color Guard placed sixth out of 45 bands in their division at the United States Scholastic Band Association Competition in Philadelphia, PA. The Symphony Band received its seventh consecutive Superior Rating at the Connecticut ASBDA Concert Band Festival held at Bacon Academy in Colchester. The men of the RHS Choir performed at the Board of Education meeting honoring student achievement in the arts. Twelve students from the band and choir were chosen to participate in the Connecticut Eastern Region Music Festival at UConn in January with three of those students being chosen to participate in the All-State Music Festival at the Bushnell in April. Choir member Teri Underhill was recognized by the Connecticut Association of Schools for her achievement in the performing arts. Seven students from the VCMS Band and Chorus were chosen to participate in the Eastern Region Middle School Music Festival which was held in March. The VCMS Marching Band and Color Guard marched again in the 2001 Memorial Day Parade. Center Road School had six of their grade 5 chorus students participate in the 2001 CT Children's Honor Choir Festival sponsored by the Connecticut Chapter of the American Choral Directors Association. All students in grades three, four and five participated in the World's Largest Concert sponsored by the Music Educator's National Conference. Skinner Road School students were involved in several performances this year. All students in grades 4 and 5 participated in the Holiday Program 38   which involved parents and teachers in constructing the costumes for all of the children. Family Music Night was held in March for students in grades 1 and 2. Grade 3 students presented an earth day program in April. The chorus and band students presented a Fine Arts Night performance in May. Students in grades 4 and 5 were able to demonstrate their musical skills at a talent show in June. Northeast School formed KUC-Kids, an auditioned show choir. The students performed in March as part of Music in Our Schools Month. Grade 4 students performed patriotic songs in May for the veterans at the Rocky Hill Veterans Home. Maple Street School second graders integrated their Japanese unit with music. Students wrote poems and then put them to music. One poem from each class was chosen to create a dramatic interpretation of it based on the rhythmic flow of the music and the descriptive words. CENTER ROAD SCHOOL - Mr. David Engelson, Principal Mrs. Mary Jo Myslinski, Assistant Principal In addition to our continued effort to improve student achievement, we spent a great deal of time on cultural diversity and the ""Arts"". The following programs were brought to Center Road for the 2000-2001 school year: Judy Buch, Puppets - Multicultural; Leslie Johnson- Creative Writing/Poetry; High Tech High Touch - Science; Martin Luther King Program; CT Opera Express - Music Program; This Old Hat  Women's History; Crabgrass Puppets - Theater Program; Sankofa Kuumba  African Music Program; Lutz Museum - Science - Animals; Motoko  Japanese Culture and Story Telling; and Chinese Folk Dance Co. - Dance Program. Our grade 4 students participated with two other school systems in a sister school exchange; one being the Jumoke Academy Charter School in Hartford and the other the North Canaan Elementary School. Our fifth grade students did their sister school exchange with the Anna Norris School in East Hartford. Our activities included the First Lego League Contest, Word Masters, Math Olympiad, Accelerated Reading and Math, Leadership and Environmental Student Conferences and the New England Math League contest. In an effort to foster parental involvement for both parents and students, several evening programs were held. These included orientation programs for preschool and kindergarten, Open House, Family Math, Writer's Fair, Native American Night, Invention Convention and Fine Arts Night. Center Road continues to do many service and civic programs within our school community. Our Safety Patrol and other after-school activities 39   certainly keep us all busy. Our chorus and instrumental band program dedicated their Fine Arts Presentation to Mr. Maneggia, who retired after serving our school district for forty-three years. LAKE STREET SCHOOL - Mr. Stephen Casavant, Principal 2000-2001 proved to be both an exciting and rewarding year for the students at Lake Street School. For the second year in a row, Lake Street students were among the best-performing on a statewide basis in the Governor's Reading Challenge. Students read more than 9,500 books, an increase over last year's total of 8,600. Not satisfied with the success of the summer reading program, teachers designed and implemented a student/family year-long reading program titled ""Million Minute Mania"". The goal of this program was to accumulate 1,000,000 minutes of reading during the year. Greater opportunities for students to write and publish were made available to all students throughout the year. A celebration of reading and writing for parents and students was held at the end of the year to highlight student accomplishments in these areas. Now in the third year of our theme ""Commitment to Literacy and Character"", Lake Street has adopted programs focused on character development. These programs include a student code of conduct and a home/school (parent-student-school) compact. During the course of the year, students were engaged in numerous activities which reinforced our commitment to the development of each students' academic success and character development. Academic success programs included: Exploratories (high interest activities for students in grades 3-5); Math Olympiads; New England Math League; an after-school Math Club; Geography Olympiad and Word Masters. Character development programs engaged all students in grades K-5 providing family food baskets at Thanksgiving, holiday service projects, Circle of Friends program, Lunch Bunch, and class meetings focusing on the seven core virtues (honesty, perseverance, respect, responsibility, giving, compassion and discipline). The PTO continued to be a vital part of the school community. Through their support, numerous programs were presented to students highlighting the arts and cultural awareness. The PTO was also instrumental in organizing an extremely successful Parent Volunteer program. MAPLE STREET SCHOOL - Mr. Gerald Griffin, Principal Maple Street School staff continued its commitment to high standards of student achievement. For the second year, Maple Street School was selected to participate in the national Comprehensive School Reform 40   Demonstration program. This initiative provided federal monies to implement a research-based reading instruction at Maple Street School. One part of the initiative was the introduction of the Waterford Early Reading Program in second grade. This program provided the students with individualized daily instruction utilizing computers. It also provided parents with materials to use at home. A second component of the initiative provided students in grades 2 to 5 with more non-fiction materials and instruction that supported the science and social studies curriculum. Finally, a school-wide motivational program to encourage children to read was implemented. The children read over 20,000 books during the school year. The major emphasis for this school year was the development of student computer skills. Second grade students were taught keyboarding skills. Grade 3 to grade 5 students were taught to do research projects by gathering information using the internet. The children were also shown how to access only safe sites on the internet. Another significant initiative at Maple Street School was the expansion of the theme of respect as a way to achieve success. For several years, the school has been emphasizing respecting oneself and respecting others in school-sponsored programs. During the 2000-01 school year the theme ""Developing a Community of Learners"" was added. This theme was added to support the idea of working together and supporting each other. Each classroom taught lessons on communicating respectfully to each other, developing leadership skills, and resolving differences in a peaceful manner. Changing student behavior at recess was a major part of developing a sense of community. The children were taught numerous recess games and the walk/jog club was started. In addition, they were taught how to play in a respectful and safe manner. Finally, children were given leadership roles at the schools by presenting the Citizens of the Month program. Maple Street School continued to provide the students with an extraordinarily enriched learning environment for all children. Children were provided with numerous cultural arts experiences (plays, storyteller, magician, concerts, author), and presentations (Mark Twain, robotics, and developing an invention), and field trips (museums, nature center, civil war reenactment and sister schools). In addition, the children were provided with many challenging learning opportunities such as: Word Masters, Mathematics Olympiad, Accelerated Reading, Leadership and Environmental Conferences, and New England Mathematics League contest. Finally, parents and students had the opportunity to attend many curriculum events such as: Family Math, Family Reading, Learning Fair, student musical performances and plays, student showcase and festival of lights. NORTHEAST SCHOOL - Mr. Norman Rivard, Principal 41   During the 2000-2001 school year, Northeast School continued to provide its students an excellent education, following curriculum set by the Vernon Board of Education. Initiatives undertaken included the following: ! ! ! ! Following action plans developed last year, the Harcourt Brace reading/language arts materials were fully implemented. Student writing improvement was addressed by implementing the ""Empowering Writers"" model and materials. Northeast teachers addressed the need for math improvement by Scott Foresman and Harcourt Brace. The latter was adopted district-wide. A complete needs assessment of Northeast's ""Kids Under Construction"" organizational model was completed, based on input from students, parents and staff. Modifications were made based upon determined needs. A robotics club was established using a grant from Pratt and Whitney and two teams competed in a tournament at Central Connecticut State University on December 3. A new choral group, the KUC Kids, was organized and performed for students and staff. They were also asked to perform for Law Day ceremonies at the Tolland County Courthouse on May 4. A Sister School Partnership, sponsored by a grant from Capital Region Education Council and the Hartford Foundation, was established with Silver Lane School in East Hartford. This partnership provided grade 1 students the opportunity of developing learning experiences in science with students from a more diverse school. This project will continue and expand to grade 2 next year.  !  !  !  All the initiatives were undertaken with the goal of making our school better, providing opportunities and experiences to develop students' academics, character and commitment to being responsible citizens. SKINNER ROAD SCHOOL - Mrs. Frances Bilodeau, Principal Academic growth is a top priority at Skinner Road School, with more students included in testing than ever before. Test results indicated that instructional effort is making an impact in math scores. Intensified instructional effort in the areas of reading, writing, spelling, revising and editing was implemented as a result of school-wide plans developed by teachers, coordinators and administrators. Five students from grade 5 represented Skinner Road School at the State 42   Invention Convention at the University of Connecticut. A new district initiative, Empowering Writers, was implemented this year in grades 1-5 with teachers participating in staff development training. Yearend results demonstrated growth in writing skills. Concentrated staff development continued in math problem solving, aligning curriculum and instruction to the third generation CMT math objectives and NCTM standards. Summer reading, writing and math activities are promoted through our summer reading incentives, the Governor's Reading Program, math booklets, summer workbooks and district summer school. A Connecticut School Change Grant for $2,500 helped promote communication and develop a relationship between Skinner Road School staff and child care providers in Vernon that was focused on helping parents to be their child's first best teacher. This initial planning grant has been a great beginning. Participation in the 3/83 Grant for a fourth and fifth grade class at Skinner Road School and Manchester's Highland Park School has been exciting with science and technology the main focus, including bird watching, a trip to Hammonasset and multi-cultural games. Cultural activities that broadened horizons at Skinner Road School included but were not limited to the following: Read Across America celebration of Dr. Seuss' birthday, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Mr. Magic Science Assemblies, as well as guest author Richard Wainwright. Students participated in New England Math League, Word Masters in grades 4-5, Math Olympiads in grades 4-5, Inter-Elementary Band, Family Music Night for grades 1 and 2, grades 4-5 talent show, grade 5 Invention Convention, Science Fair, Drug Awareness Week and contests, Multi- Cultural Games Night, and summer and after-school Spanish and French. Field trips included visits to Valley Falls, Springfield Science Museum, Boston Harbor and Aquarium, Wadsworth Athenaeum, West Hartford Science Museum, the circus and Talcott Mountain. One of the highlights of the year was the school-wide making of a video Lights, Camera, Action -which was shown on Public Access television. VERNON CENTER MIDDLE SCHOOL - Mr. Dennis Bieu, Principal Dr. Beth Katz, Asst. Principal Mr. James Harrison, Asst.Principal Vernon Center Middle School has enjoyed its first year as a National Blue Ribbon School. In September VCMS was recognized in Washington where a plaque and flag were presented. In November an evening celebration for the community was held. Mr. Dennis Bieu left in December to pursue new opportunities and Dr. Beth Katz, Assistant Principal, was selected as the new principal.  43   Channel 99 This school-wide initiative continued to provide incentives and programs to keep the school safe, develop positive character traits and make positive school connections for students, staff, parents and community. Students earned game-days (a block of time to play board games in the cafeteria) each quarter by remaining free of any physical altercations. The Channel 99 Breakdancers were 22 goodwill ambassadors for the school. They performed at the VCMS Talent Show, UCONN Breakdancers Club, Manchester Youth Bureau, Channel 99 Potluck Dinner, Northeast School Fun Fair and Day in the Park. Language Arts Center The Language Arts Center again sponsored several school and grade wide events. Grade 6 students participated for the second year in the Nutmeg Children's Choice Book Award Program. The sixth annual Book Fair involved all students in all grades. Read Across America Day was encouraged through distribution of materials. The center established a mini-library for reluctant readers who need books for book reports or pleasure reading. ESL Program During the 2000-2001 school year eleven countries (Canada, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, Japan, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico and Vietnam) were represented at the VCMS English as a Second Language Center. The students from these countries spoke nine different languages. As a result of this mixture of cultures and languages, students throughout the school were given the opportunity to increase their understanding of students from varied international backgrounds. Mathematics Department The mathematics department had an excellent year with students showing growth in many areas. The CMT scores for grade 8 students were the highest ever. The department continued to grow and change as technology continued to change the math landscape. On March 14 (3/14), the first annual ""Pi"" In honor of Read Across America, every math teacher read a math-related book with students. Science Department The 2000-2001 school year was the second in a three-year curriculum revision of the science curriculum. Seventh grade students primarily study the life sciences. This includes the human body, which has traditionally been covered in eighth grade. The final phase-in will conclude in the 20012002 school year, when the eighth grade shifts to studying the physical sciences. 44   Social Studies Department The department had several exciting developments during the year. The sixth and seventh grade social studies teachers successfully continued the implementation of their revised curricula. The eighth grade teachers completed the revision of their curriculum guide and are looking forward to implementing it in the 2001-2002 school year. The new guide concentrates on eight main content areas and incorporates the Social Studies Frameworks for the State of Connecticut. The department worked diligently to develop Social Studies Frameworks for the summer school program at VCMS; the primary focus of these frameworks is to assist students in acquiring those social studies skills that are necessary to successfully progress to the next grade. In addition, the PBLA model and the incorporation of technology into the curricula continued to receive greater emphasis. Over 200 students participated in the Social Studies Fair in Town Hall. The department also sponsored several assemblies at school. One program, ""Mikata"", involved a live performance by a team of professional musicians. This augmented the seventh and eighth grade curricula, particularly an appreciation of a multi-cultural musical experience. Grade 6 students enjoyed the multi-cultural assembly, ""Tales from the First World."" An award-winning, one-man show presented by Mr. Kevin Johnson of the Connecticut State Library depicted the experiences of an African-American unit, the 29th Connecticut Infantry, during the American Civil War. Language Arts Department The department adopted a new English grammar and composition book published by Houghton-Mifflin, copyrighted 2001, for grades 6, 7 and 8. Once again many classes entered the national Wordmasters competition and the Elks Club essay contest. Grade 6 students participated in the Nutmeg Book selection process. Several teachers initiated Literature Circles in their classrooms. Vernon Bermuda Workshop The 2000-2001 school year marked the 32nd year that Vernon has been sending students on a week-long science trip to the Bermuda Biological Station for Research. Virtually every undergraduate school that uses the Station has modeled part of its entire program after Vernon's. Tolland sent a group of middle school students in June as a result of VCMS's guidance and assistance. Parents, students and elementary classes follow the week and communicate with participants through the school's website. School-to-Career Initiative The eighth grade School-to-Career course has two objectives: self-awareness and career awareness. Students first identified individual strengths, 45   weaknesses, aptitudes and interests, personality types, learning and thinking styles and work values. Once determined, careers were linked to individual attributes by career assessments and computer programs. Activities in the class included lectures, small group discussions, games, videos, computer research and volunteer guest speakers. Mastery Madness In its second year, Mastery Madness was again a huge success. Attendance was up during the week and students and staff enjoyed the opportunity to work together on academics, team building activities and school spirit. The Mastery Madness committee will continue to work hard to ensure greater success for this program. VCMS Library The librarians purchased 321 new books during the 2000-2001 school year. The six adult volunteers helped weed out over 600 non-used, out-of date books, making room for new resources. The professional library is now part of our library system. Students, staff and community members continue to use the computers. The computers were put on a network to facilitate problem solving. Access to the library by all classes in 2001-2002 will be improved through a new schedule for reading classes. Many departments have increased their use of the research tools the library provides. The library sponsored its second annual poetry contest. VCMS Intramurals This program provided additional competitive sport activities for all students in grades 6, 7 and 8. Activities included golf, football, indoor soccer, basketball, volleyball, dodgeball, weight training, hockey and bowling. After Hours Program This program consisted of structured and recreational activities for students two and one-half hours, two days per week, after school. The focus of the program was to assist students with school-related work. VCMS staff provided tutorial assistance. Attendance incentives, including field trips, were offered. Writer's Club The club spent a busy year writing about a wide range of subjects as diverse as angst and ants! The ultimate result was a book for each student. Copies were available in the VCMS Library, Rockville Public Library and the Superintendent's Office.  46   Scrabble Club For the first time, Scrabble Club was added to the list of after-school activities. Open to all levels of players, the students and advisors engaged in friendly competition. The club hopes to participate in the National School Scrabble Club Championship in 2001-2002. Lego League A group of 10 students in grades 6, 7 and 8 created a robot made of Legos to compete in a regional competition at Central Connecticut State University. The group had several advisors, both teachers and parents, who brought expertise to the project. Drama Club The Drama Club had a very successful year. The fall production was The Phantom of the Talent Show, Version 3.0, which was sold out. Participation included acts ranging from lip-syncing to breakdancing. The spring production, Our Town, was presented for three performances, one in the evening and two during the school day. Student Council The Student Council is open to all students who may join at any time throughout the year. The Council was active in their volunteer projects. These projects include the teen advisory board to the Rockville Public Library, annual food drive, holiday turkey baskets, Coats for Kids, Toys for Tots, the Mitten Tree, Jingle Bell Walk for the Arthritis Foundation and the Valentine's Day flower sale to benefit the American Heart Association. Each month the Student Council chose a local charity to receive the donations of casual Friday. Charities included the American Cancer Society, American Lung Association, Tri-Town Pantry, Cornerstone Soup Kitchen and My Sister's Place. In addition to providing service to the community, the Student Council also provided service to the school including acting as guides at the Open Houses and 5th Grade Orientation, sponsoring school dances and the 6th grade social, and fund-raising for the grade 8 outing. Members of the Council also attended leadership workshops presented through the Connecticut Association of Student Councils. Grade 5 Orientation Fifth graders from each elementary school visited during the month of May. Channel 99's ""Cast of Characters"" presented a puppet show on fifth grade fears and sixth grade realities. Sixth grade students presented information and answered questions.

The Department contracts for bookkeeping, auditing and legal services. THE PRIMARY MISSION The Primary mission of the NCDHD is disease prevention and surveillance and health promotion in the districts population. The District is responsible for programs in a number of areas including:           Preventing epidemics and outbreaks of diseases; undertaking epidemiological investigations, follow-up and working to prevent the spread of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases and the like. Overseeing the state childhood immunization requirements and providing free vaccine to clinics and private physicians upon request. Inspection of restaurants, other food service establishments and facilities and the epidemiological investigations follow-up and prevention of the spread of food borne diseases. Safety inspections and drinking water quality testing of homes, schools, convalescent homes and other institutions, and water quality testing of bathing areas. Review, testing and approval of new septic systems, as well as the review and approval of plans for system repairs and/or expansion. Provision of laboratory testing of drinking water, paint samples for lead, blood, stool and other samples as may be necessary in the investigation of outbreaks and illnesses.

Monitoring the health status of the population. Assistance to the Department of Environmental Protection upon request for help in collection of samples or for follow-up or investigation of specific problems.  56   HIGHLIGHTS The 2000  2001 year saw continued growth related activity in the District. The Town of Vernon swimming facilities at Valley Falls, camp Newhoca , and Newhoca Park tested generally satisfactorily throughout this summer and required little additional follow-up testing. This year town pools were all satisfactory. Food related inspections have remained constant. Twelve food establishments changed ownership or renovated, requiring new licensing. The Director of Public Health reviewed all reportable cases of disease received from physicians and laboratories and where warranted performed follow-up and/or intervention, in the interest of stopping the spread of communicable disease. The Director of Health has taken an active role this year in the newly emerging West Nile Virus problem. With support primarily from the towns of Suffield and Vernon, as well as other yet to be affected towns in the District, the Director made a presentation to CRCOG strongly encouraging a unified request for state level funding of a comprehensive larvicide program. The Director has encouraged communication between all regional council of governments, as well as input to the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities in an effort to take a proactive approach to the development of a realistic statewide plan to get ahead of the problem. Publication education in regard to the elimination of standing water on private properties will be encouraged as an integral part of any municipal and statewide efforts at reducing the habitat of the mosquito population. During the 2000  2001 year, several crows were found to be positive for the virus around the Vernon area. North Central's website; www.NCDHD.org has the latest information and links to DEP, State Health Department and Department of Agriculture websites for those wanting more information. Raccoon rabies remains endemic in the area. Surveillance and confirmation of rabies by laboratory testing continues. Again this year, we have seen an increase in Lyme Disease in the general District area. The Department continues to be involved in ACTIVE exercise classes encouraging those of all ages who do not routinely exercise to ""get involved"", and Nutrition and Weight Management programs. We hold these classes in different towns throughout the District where they are not duplicated by hospitals or other existing programs. A community health needs assessment study was undertaken by the Health District this year with the draft due August 2001. The study will help guide us in determining how Suffield compared to the State as a whole and what, if any, interventions and actions may be useful in improving the general health of the population. SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES ACTIVITY The following inspections and investigations are listed. It should be noted that the raw numbers are no indication of time spent or the relative complexity of inspections, therefore a comparison is only possible in the most general sense.  57   TOWN OF VERNON Year End Report June 30, 2001  Town of Vernon PERMITS/APPLICATIONS RECEIVED: a.

Ashland Grove Hill Cemetery, 22 Cemetery Avenue The Vernon Cemetery Commission consists of five, Town Council approved members. The Commission has responsibility for maintenance of the four town owned cemeteries by overseeing the cemetery superintendent activities and his staff. During this fiscal year there were 79 burials; 69 in Grove Hill and 10 in Elmwood. Of these 28 were cremations. We sold 50 lots in Grove Hill and one in Elmwood. The commission was saddened by the death of our chairman, Wayne E. Ladd, on November 3, 2000. Wayne served on the commission for 15 years and 10 years as chairman. He was very instrumental in finding land for a new cemetery. A sign at the entrance of Grove Hill Cemetery, constructed of granite from one of the old mills, was dedicated in memory of Mr. Ladd. The Commission continues to be pleased with the efforts of Superintendent Alan West and his staff to provide extra efforts and initiative in keeping our four town owned cemeteries in excellent shape. As usual we invite comment as to how we can improve our services. Commission Members: Andrew J. Ashland, Chairman; Scott Brown, Norman Strong, Jean Luddy, Secretary; and Elsie Williams.

The effort is straightforward: redirect infrastructural spending                   away from roads that promote automobile dependency and toward                   mass transit systems. At the same time, implement an urban growth                   boundary that restricts suburban development and encourages mixed-use                   development around transit centers. If it is necessary for major                   commercial development to be located in the suburbs, ensure that                   they are clustered with other commercial and residential areas                   and are located very near a transit center.                  This type of land use planning has been successful in limiting                   sprawl in Oregon and more recently has been adopted by Florida                   as a means to channel growth into existing developed areas, especially                   central cities, which have both a high minority population and                   unemployment rate. Development within the urban core serves to                   revitalize urban neighborhoods and protect the environment.                  In the Connecticut area, traditional development along the Long                   Island Sound has damaged wetlands, river and stream banks and                   degraded open land that served to filter pollutants before they                   reached the Sound. It is the hope of the CCA that their plans                   to focus on infrastructural development of mass transit rather                   than roads will save enough money to pay for new sewage treatment                   plants that will help clean up Long Island Sound.                                    Program Highlights                   Program Details                                       Shift infrastructural development toward mass transit and                     away from roads.                     Encourage mixed-use development.                     Establish urban growth boundaries.                     Require that housing be located within reasonable distances                     from job sites.                     Require pedestrian and bicycle paths.                                   Mass Transit and Mixed-Use Development Benefits                                       Regional mass transit systems provide convenient, reliable                     transportation within urban regions and dramatically reduce                     energy consumption, air pollution and the cost of getting to                     and from work.                     Growth is contained within urban service boundaries so that                     open space, wetlands, agricultural lands and other sensitive                     habitat are protected.                     Because of the proximity of residential and commercial centers,                     auto commutes are more rare and shorter, reducing fuel consumption                     and air pollution.

CCA has drafted planning legislation, the Connecticut                         Energy and Land Conservation and Development Act, which                         they are working to have introduced and passed.                         CCA has developed a slide presentation to help education                         Connecticut residents about the benefits of stopping sprawl.                                                                                                  Published: May 1997                                                      Success stories designed by  Mark                   W.

As a result, Maryland is well on its way to meeting the Chesapeake Bay Agreement's goal of preserving 20% of the State's Bay watershed. While no single program provides this protection, several state agencies, working through a web of statutes, regulations, and policies, have successfully implemented the most effective conservation efforts in the United States. While Maryland continues to lead in the area of land conservation, Governor Robert L. Ehrlich, Jr. has identified new administrative policies to enhance these very successful programs. Accordingly, Maryland will focus all land conservation programs on the Bay, outdoor recreational facilities, and land base for agricultural and forestry industries, which will enable the State to maximize its land conservation investment. This focus will maximize conservation efforts and support a significant economic base throughout the state. Recreation lands, open space, rural and historic landscapes, and the agricultural and forest lands conserved by these programs are integral to the State's tourism and agricultural and natural resource-based industries that in turn are important factors in Maryland's economic well-being. Finally, new efforts to coordinate this focus among the agencies will provide policy makers and the State's local partners greater financial stability. The following land preservation goals were established by the 2000 Chesapeake Bay Agreement and by the General Assembly: Chesapeake Bay Agreement (CBA): Permanently preserve 20% of the Bay watershed by 2010 =  Applied to the total state land area (93.8% of the State is in the Bay watershed)  Total protected land July 2003 (19.13%)  Additional Protection needed to meet CBA goal (0.96%)  Additional protection needed per year to meet CBA goal 1,241,605 acres 6,208,025 acres 1,187,849 acres 53,756 acres 7,680 acres al acres acres acres acres  Senate Joint Resolution 10, 2002, Prime Agricultural Land: Protect three times more farmland than was protected in April 2002 by MALPF, Rural Legacy, GreenPrint and Loc Purchase or Transfer of Development Rights by 2022 = 1,030,000  Acres protected by MALPF, RLP, GP & Counties as of FY 2003 393,552  Remaining Goal by 2022 636,448  Additional prime agricultural acres needed per year by 2022 33,497  Governor Ehrlich has directed state agencies to meet existing state land preservation goals of the 2000 Chesapeake Bay Agreement and the prime agricultural land preservation goals of SJ10. This will be achieved through new policies to focus all state preservation investment on resource lands. The essence of this new policy is to ensure that all conservation funding be utilized to maximize a positive impact on the Bay's watershed and water quality. The administration will:  1     Focus state land conservation programs on the most strategic lands to protect the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries as well as the most significant natural and agricultural resources; Apply the best scientific information and technology to identify resource lands that are most important, the potential threats to these lands, and areas in which preservation goals can be maximized; and Establish a process for collaboration and coordination among state and local land conservation programs to identify geographic and natural resource areas. A COORDINATED AND FOCUSED APPROACH TO LAND CONSERVATION      The following outline identifies principles to guide and focus the implementation of the State's land conservation programs on preserving the Bay. Focus State Land Conservation Priorities and Investments All state land conservation programs will identify the most critical areas for conservation and focus on permanently preserving Maryland's most important land resources. These areas include lands impacting the water quality and natural habitat of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, the State's most important resource-based industries, lands necessary to the State's resource-based industries, and lands necessary to foster tourism, recreation, and Maryland's natural environment. State agencies also will focus stewardship and restoration programs on areas where the State has made significant investments in land conservation. Easement acquisition guidelines will be developed in consultation with local governing bodies to identify the best agricultural and forestry lands of the State. Properties identified by the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture as high priorities will be considered favorable conservation investments. Use Best Available Information and Technology The State will use the best available mapping, data and geographic information systems to identify the most important parcels of land based on ecological and economic value, contribution to Chesapeake Bay restoration, and vulnerability to land use changes. The Department of Natural Resources' Green Infrastructure and Strategic Forest Lands Assessments are two tools that will be used, in conjunction with other available data, to help determine state land conservation focus areas for the DNR. The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation will incorporate mapping and geographic information systems capabilities to implement new ranking guidelines in cooperation with local partners. The Department of Planning's Master Parcel Database identify and map land most vulnerable to development or land use changes that would have a negative impact on the State's conservation efforts. Emphasize Cooperation and Collaboration The State will establish a process for collaboration and coordination among state and local land conservation programs, in cooperation with local governments, landowners, and private conservation groups, to identify geographic and natural resource areas. Each program's conservation strengths and legislatively mandated activities will be directed toward accomplishing the State's overall land protection goals.  2   IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVES Focus State Acquisitions  The State will use DNR's Green Infrastructure and Strategic Forest Lands Assessments to prioritize land conservation. This will prioritize watersheds according to their impact on the Bay and the ecological values of forestry lands. Protecting lands in both categories enhances efforts to protect the Bay because each category of land directly impacts the Bay's water quality (See Attachment 2). This prioritization will be applied to land and easement purchases. The State will establish a coordinated, proactive approach to identify, prioritize and act on key land preservation opportunities through federal, state and local land conservation programs. The administration will evaluate funding needs to meet agricultural land preservation goals and identify the prime agricultural and forestry lands of the State. The administration will work with the General Assembly, the Departments of Agriculture, Planning and Natural Resources, Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF), the appointed MALPF Task Force, and agricultural and forestry groups throughout these important decisions. State land purchases will be prioritized and coordinated with other Bay restoration efforts. Emphasis will be given to acquiring private in-holdings within existing DNR land units to alleviate management problems, provide public access, and protect natural resources. The General Assembly passed Senate Bill 564 in 2003 commissioning MALPF to develop easement acquisition guidelines in consultation with local governing bodies. MALPF will work with the Department of Planning and the Natural Resource Conservation Service (of USDA) to develop these guidelines working with local jurisdictions. The Governor will establish a land conservation work group of staff from the state's land conservation programs to provide a coordinated approach to land conservation with a focus on the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The State will use the 2005-2006 Land Preservation and Recreation Planning Process initiated by the Department of Planning to coordinate land conservation plans among state and local governments' land conservation programs. The State will coordinate federal land conservation programs to protect riparian buffers along the Bay and its tributaries. Further, the State will work to increase the flexibility of federal land conservation programs to ensure these programs contribute to protecting water quality and habitat in the Bay watershed. Consistent with legal sufficiency, the State will reduce the time delay and uncertainty in the State acquisition process by reducing the number of approvals of each transaction. This will alleviate the burden and frustration for landowners willing to protect their land. The State will identify potential revenue sources for land preservation, including: 3          Improve the Process for Implementing State Programs         Enhance Funding for Land Conservation Programs    a. Seeking a return to using 100% of real estate transfer tax revenues for funding land conservation and park improvements when the State's fiscal condition improves, as provided by Section 13-209 of the Tax-Property Article of the Maryland Code; b. Acquiring land with installment purchases whenever possible, by allowing a certain portion of the agricultural or real estate transfer taxes to be used for the acquisition of zero coupon bonds and debt service for Installment Purchase Agreements in order to leverage limited state special funds with federal bonds and provide tax benefits to participating landowners; c. Collaborating with other states that are signatories of the 2000 Bay Agreement to more effectively secure new sources of federal or private funding for land conservation; d. Enhancing state and local tax incentives for land conservation, including private donations of land and conservation easements. The State will evaluate, and where feasible, incorporate the tax incentives outlined in the report on taxes prepared for the Chesapeake Bay Program; and e. Increasing the marketing of conservation easements. PROGRAM GOALS FOR LAND CONSERVATION  SUMMARY Background As individual state land conservation programs were established, starting in 1967 with the Maryland Environmental Trust, each program was given a general purpose, but was not given quantified goals and timelines. More specific ""concept goals"" were established by the implementing agencies after Program Open Space was established in 1969, such as ""to protect open space at a rate that keeps pace with the rate that land is developed."" Quantified goals were not set until 2000 when the signatories to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement (Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and the federal Environmental Protection Agency) established a goal to permanently protect from development 20% of the land within the Bay watershed by the year 2010. These goals generally overlap with statewide goals described on page 1. For example, the recent goals for the Chesapeake Bay Agreement and for preserving prime agricultural land overlap, and these contribute to the POS general goal of preserving land at a rate that keeps pace with development. Continuing to preserve land through POS, the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF), the Rural Legacy Program (RLP), the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), Maryland Environmental Trust (MET), or federal or local land preservation programs is essential to meeting these statewide goals. The following is an outline of the state program goals for land conservation and the status of what the State and these programs have accomplished by the end of FY 2003.  4   PROGRAM GOALS AND STATUS See table page 6 Program Open Space:  Goal  acquire land necessary to conserve strategic natural resources while providing recreational and economic opportunities  keep pace with development.

In 1970 the General Assembly dedicated  of 1% real estate transfer tax to fund Program Open Space. This funding concept was based on the principles that the rate of funding for state land acquisition and local parks should keep pace with the rate that land is developed and when someone buys his house he also contributes to the open space and recreational assets of their community. All POS transfer tax revenues were initially divided 50%-50%, with half of the funds distributed to the 23 counties and Baltimore City by an allocation formula (based on population, growth rate of the county and the amount of transfer tax collected from each local jurisdiction) and the other half distributed to POS to state land acquisition. As the income from the transfer tax grew, especially in the late 1970s and 1980s when real estate activity and home prices increased, the General Assembly put annual ""caps"" on the revenue to POS. Beginning in 1980, tax revenue over this cap was diverted to the General Fund. Between FY1980 and FY2003, about $761.8 million in transfer tax revenues were diverted to the General Fund, which is about 41.3% of all transfer taxes collected since 1970. These funds were partially replaced during this period by $216.5 million in bond authorizations for POS and other land conservation programs using the transfer tax. For each of the past six years, POS has conserved land at a rate equal to or greater than the rate land was developed. Between 1998 and 2003, when an average of 14,618 acres of land per year was developed, POS protected an average of 16,816 acres. Between FY2002 and FY2004, $216.8 million in transfer taxes have been diverted to the General Fund and replaced by $102.8 million in bonds. This resulted in a net loss of $114 million to land conservation programs over this three-year period. While the transfer tax was diverted to the General Fund, the General Assembly also permitted several other uses of POS funds. A share of the local POS funds was used for park capital improvements. In 1977 the MALPF program began receiving a share of transfer tax revenues. In 1985 a 2% set-aside was provided for the Heritage Conservation Fund to acquire threatened or endangered species habitat. In 1990 the Departments of General Services, Planning, and Natural Resources were allowed to use 3% of the transfer tax for administration. DNR was allowed 25% of its state share of the transfer tax for capital improvement and critical maintenance projects, replacing prior general obligation bond funds. In 1997 the Heritage Area Finance Authority began receiving $1 million per year, and the Rural Legacy Program was authorized to use a share of DNR's transfer tax, in addition to authorized bond funds. As a result, the DNR's share of transfer tax revenues for land acquisition declined from 50% in FY1970 to 14.8% in FY2003. MALPF's share has increased from $2 million, or 7.14%, in FY1979 to 17.05% in FY2003. Accomplishments From 1970 to the end of FY2003, POS has funded the acquisition of 233,533 acres of land in fee simple and protected 17,186 acres with purchased easements, including those funded in part with federal programs described below. Local governments have acquired 7   36,388 acres with POS assistance, contributing to a total of 287,107 acres of preserved land. Most citizens in Maryland now have access to a park or protected open space within 15 minutes of their home as a result of POS funding. POS Funding The following is a summary of DNR funding for POS and other land conservation and park programs for fiscal year 2004.

In addition, a significant portion of the land protected by both stateside and local POS funds has been along the streams and tributaries feeding into the Chesapeake Bay. For many years, POS stateside funds were earmarked for Bay access and for specific streams and tributaries of the Bay, such as: Patapsco, Patuxent, Susquehanna, Deer Creek, Monocacy, Pocomoke, and Severn. Most of the State's acquisitions through POS have been fee simple interests in natural resource lands, protecting Maryland's rich ecological resources and preserving vegetation that filters the runoff of water into the streams, rivers and the Bay. The 287,107  8   acres of land protected by POS contributes significantly to meeting the Bay Agreement's goal to preserve 20% of the Bay watershed by 2010. Rural Legacy Program The General Assembly established the Rural Legacy Program (RLP) in 1997 to protect areas of large, contiguous blocks of land of rural landscapes, including agricultural, natural, cultural, and forestry resources. The program is a community-up process where local governments, private land trusts, farming, forestry, historic preservation, and other interest groups work together with landowners to achieve common land preservation goals in focused Rural Legacy Areas (RLAs). These areas must meet legislatively designated criteria, which includes the agricultural significance; forestry and natural resources aspects of the land; potential to protect large blocks of contiguous land (including greenways and wildlife corridors); value of resource-based industries and degree of threat to the resources. Local governments and land trusts (sponsors), in consultation with landowners, nominate RLAs that represent important rural working landscapes and significant natural resources. Sponsors prepare a long-term plan for protection of the area, including funding alternatives in addition to state funds, and apply to the Rural Legacy Board for area designation and grant funding. The Rural Legacy Board, composed of the Secretaries of Natural Resources, Agriculture and Planning, working with a Governor-appointed Advisory Committee representing a variety of interests in land use, recommends the designation RLAs and the distribution of the annual appropriations. The Board of Public Works approves the designation of all Rural Legacy Areas and grant funding. While some acquisitions are in fee simple, a majority of land conservation is by perpetual easement. RLP Funding The RLP is funded with a combination of general obligation bonds and a share of the state's allocation of Program Open Space real estate transfer tax revenues. Since the program was enacted, the Rural Legacy Board and the Maryland Board of Public Works have approved $132.9 million in grants to 25 Rural Legacy Areas. Twenty-one of Maryland's 23 counties are participating in the program. RURAL LEGACY FUND APPROPRIATIONS FISCAL YEAR 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 TOTAL TRANS.

Per acre costs for conservation easements have averaged about $2,600.  9   How RLP Protects the Chesapeake Bay Most of the 25 Rural Legacy Areas are located directly on the Bay or the shores of a major tributary of the Bay. RLP is a targeted and focused land conservation program designed to protect large, contiguous blocks of land to conserve the State's significant natural resources and sustain resource-based industries. This conservation is achieved through perpetual conservation easements of riparian buffers, protection of wetlands, best management practices through soil and water quality plans, and conservation of agricultural, forestry and natural resources. The 40,129 acres of land protected by the RLP contribute significantly to meeting the Bay Agreement's goal to preserve 20% of the Bay watershed by 2010. GreenPrint Program In 2001 the General Assembly enacted a new program designed to protect lands critical to the long-term ecological health of the State. These lands, referred to as Maryland's Green Infrastructure, provide the natural foundation to support a diverse plant and animal population and facilitate natural processes like filtering water and cleaning the air. DNR identified over two million acres of Green Infrastructure lands, 529,771 acres of which are now protected. The program was expected to boost the State's land conservation capacity by about 10,000 acres per year for five years. GreenPrint Funding In FY 2002 the GreenPrint Program received a first year bond authorization of $35 million, 75% ($26,250,000) distributed to DNR and 25% ($8,750,000) to MALPF. This was later reduced by $5,000,000, which adjusted the total distribution to $22,500,000 to DNR and $7,500,000 to MALPF. In FY 2003 this authorization was limited to $16 million, with $12 million to DNR and $4 million to MALPF. In FY 2004 the program was limited to $3 million, with $2,250,000 for DNR and $750,000 for MALPF. Accomplishments At the end of only two fiscal years, DNR's GreenPrint Program protected 10 highly significant groups of properties totaling 21,146 acres of Maryland's most important natural resources. The MALPF Program also protected 8,625 acres of agricultural preservation on lands ranked very high for their Green Infrastructure values. A total of 29,771 acres was protected at an average cost of $1,542 per acre. How GreenPrint Protects the Chesapeake Bay With the exception of some forested lands in Garrett and Allegany Counties in Western Maryland that flow into the Ohio River, almost all of the 2 million acres of Green Infrastructure lands are in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. These lands are the most ecologically significant of all lands in the watershed and their protection will maintain Bay water quality and wildlife habitat. Of the 21,146 acres of land protected by the DNR portion of GreenPrint to date, much of it is directly on the Bay or on one of its major tributaries. Of the 23,000 acre Glatfelter group of properties located in six counties on the Eastern Shore and Southern Maryland, 17,000 acres of easements were acquired with GreenPrint funds. Much of this forested land is on tributaries and streams leading into the Bay, the Potomac River, or the Coastal Bays. These forestlands will be managed under a Forest Management Plan incorporated into the easement held by DNR.  10   The Maryland Environmental Trust Founded in 1967 as an quasi-independent agency of DNR, the General Assembly established the Maryland Environmental Trust (MET) to ""conserve, improve, stimulate, and perpetuate the aesthetic, natural, health and welfare, scenic, and cultural qualities of the environment, including but not limited to land, water, air, wildlife, scenic qualities, open spaces, buildings or any interests therein..."" Since the 1970s MET accomplished this mission primarily through the solicitation and management of donated conservation easements, which are donated by private landowners. The federal government and Maryland have enacted a number of financial incentives to encourage landowners to permanently protect their land. The appraised value of easements donated to MET, directly or jointly associated with any of the over 50 local land trusts (non-profit conservation organizations) in Maryland, is deductible from the donor's annual income tax over a sixyear period. The General Assembly also enacted a 15-year property tax credit for the unimproved portions of property subject to an easement donated to MET, and more recently enacted an income tax credit of up to $5,000 per year or a total of $80,000 for donors of conservation easements to MET. In addition, federal and state estate taxes can be reduced substantially for heirs of easement donors because a donated conservation easement tends to reduce the value of the protected land as a part of the overall estate. While typical costs for easements purchased by MALPF or RLP range from about $2,000 to $2,700 per acre, easements donated to the MET cost the State only about $158 per acre for administration and enforcement. Accomplishments At the end of FY 2003, MET had protected 76,230 acres of land with donated conservation easements and held a total of more than 100,000 acres of easements, including those donated and others purchased by DNR through POS, RLP, and federal transportation enhancement. How MET Protects the Chesapeake Bay By permanently protecting more than 100,000 acres of land, MET contributes significantly to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement's goal to protect 20% of the Bay watershed by 2010. Through its Land Trust Assistance Program, MET also has helped form over 40 local land trusts and assisted these non-profit land conservation organizations with administrative grants, training, and revolving loan funds (Land Trust Grant Fund) to acquire easements or fee interests in land throughout the State. The Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) This easement program is part of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the United States Department of Agriculture and Maryland. The focus of the MOA is to protect water quality by removing marginal agricultural land from production and replacing it with best management practices including riparian buffers, stabilization of highly erodible soils, and restoration of wetlands. There is a two-tier system to accomplish these water quality improvements. First, the landowner enters into a 15-year lease contract (CREP contract) to take land out of production and to install best management practices for water quality. For some of that land, a second step involves permanently protecting the land taken out of production and the best management practices on it by selling a permanent conservation easement.  11   Land trusts or Soil Conservation District (SCD) offices acquire the easements from interested landowners who voluntarily agree to sell conservation easements. The Board of Public Works approves the MOA, easement program, and county acreage values paid for the easements. The completed recorded easements are held either jointly by DNR and the land trust or SCD, or solely by DNR. Under the MOA, the USDA is committed to entering into CREP contracts on 100,000 acres of land in Maryland. The State is committed to working to preserve the CREP areas on 25,000 acres by permanent easement. Maryland's original MOA with USDA ended December 31, 2002. The State is currently operating under a one-year extension and has submitted a proposal to USDA to renew the CREP contract through 2007. CREP Program Funding The CREP easement program is funded from POS transfer tax funds. Since the program was enacted, the Maryland Board of Public Works has approved $7.5 million of CREP projects. Currently, thirteen of Maryland's 23 counties are participating in the CREP program. CREP FUND APPROPRIATIONS FISCAL YEAR FUNDING 2001 $2,500,000 2002 $2,500,000 2003 $2,500,000 TOTAL $7,500,000 CREP Accomplishments By the end of FY 2003, $4.6 million in POS funds were expended to protect 55 CREP easements on 3,875 acres of land. This step toward water quality improvement includes 3,396 of forested land, 276 acres of vegetation, and 203 acres of wetlands. The mid-range price per acre CREP pays statewide is $3,600. Additionally, 1,058 acres of CREP buffers were protected through the Rural Legacy Program. Together, the two programs have protected 4,933 acres toward the State's goal of preserving 25,000 acres of CREP buffers. Maryland landowners have received a total of about $37.5 million in federal rental payments for establishing vegetative buffers on their properties. How CREP Protects the Chesapeake Bay The lands conserved by CREP are located directly on the Bay or the shores of the Bay's tributaries. CREP protects the Chesapeake Bay by helping to reduce the occurrences of runoff, nutrients, and sediment into the Bay and promoting enhanced wildlife habitats. The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) Established by the General Assembly in 1977 to preserve productive farmland and woodland for the continued production of food and fiber for all citizens of the State, MALPF also curbs the expansion of random urban development, protects wildlife habitat, and enhances the environmental quality of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. A 12member Board of Trustees and a staff of five administer the program. MALPF is based on a partnership with local governments, which appoint local land preservation advisory 12   boards of five members to assist MALPF administer the easement selection process in each county. To qualify for MALPF, landowners must first enroll their property into an agricultural preservation district restricting its development for a minimum of five years. If the property qualifies based on size and soil characteristics, landowners apply to the local land preservation advisory board, which reviews and approves applications to be forwarded to MALPF. The application process is competitive, with each county choosing its own ranking procedure, and each application ultimately being approved or denied MALPF's Board of Trustees. Easement values are based on an appraisal of the fair market value of the property and a statutory formula that determines its after-easement agricultural value. The difference between these two values is the easement value  the maximum that a landowner can be paid for an easement. Landowners often discount their asking price below this easement value to be more competitive in those counties that use discounting as a part of their ranking systems. Other counties give criteria such as size of the farm, proximity to other protected land, and quality of the farm operation more importance than the price offered by the applicant. The second round of offers is considered solely on discounts. New legislation will reduce the reliance on discounting to prioritize easement applications while increasing the importance of the quality of the farming property and the property to local land-use objectives. MALPF Funding MALPF receives funds from several sources, including 17.05% of the transfer tax, agricultural transfer tax, state general obligation bond funds, local government funds for the 60%-40% matching funds allocation, local government funds for 100% county-funded offers, GreenPrint funds, and Federal Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program (FRPP) funds. Typically, the largest share of funds is received from the state transfer tax through POS. Under the current allocation formula in the law, MALPF received $19,501,723 of transfer taxes in FY 2002. In FY 2003 these transfer tax revenues were substantially replaced with bond funds. In addition, funds are received from a portion of the agricultural transfer tax, which is levied on the buyers and sellers of farmland converted from specially assessed agricultural use to non-agricultural use. These landowners have enjoyed very low property tax assessments, which encourage them to continue productive agriculture or forestry, and pay 3% or 5% of the sale of the farm when it is converted for non-farm use. MALPF receives two-thirds of this tax, while one-third is retained by the local jurisdiction for land preservation purposes. If the county has a certified local land preservation program, it is allowed to keep 75% of the locally collected agricultural transfer tax, and MALPF receives the remaining 25%. In FY 2003 and FY 2004, MALPF received $1,500,000 for its capital and operating budgets from this source, which usually averages $3,000,000 per year. Many counties also provide funds to help acquire easements, either from their share of the agricultural transfer tax or from other county funds. In this way, some counties are able to increase their share of the overall state funding on a 40% local, 60% state matching basis or fund additional offers with 100% local funds. Local matching funds received in FY2002 were $7,620,515. As discussed above, MALPF has received 25% of GreenPrint funding to acquire MALPF easements located wholly or partially in the Green  13   Infrastructure. MALPF received $7.5 million in FY2002, $4 million in FY2003, and $750,000 in FY2004 from GreenPrint bond funds. M ALPF STATE REVENUE SOURCES FY2002-FY2004* Fund Source Real Estate Transfer Tax Ag.

During MALPF's 25 years of existence more than 3,062 properties totaling about 400,000 acres have enrolled in Agricultural Preservation Districts, and over half (about 1,600) of these have sold easements to the MALPF. Because many landowners offering to sell easements to the MALPF discount their asking prices substantially, MALPF has purchased easements at a savings from the calculated easement value. At the end of FY 2002, the accumulated value of this discount to the State totaled almost $102 million. MALPF currently is developing and implementing new rankings guidelines to better attract the best farming properties into the program, build on the past accomplishments of MALPF and other preservation programs, and preserve large contiguous blocks of properties that ensure longterm sustainable agricultural production. A number of counties have built on their experience in partnership with MALPF to develop complementary county agricultural land preservation programs. Local preservation programs have protected over 100,000  14   additional acres, contributing significantly to the protection of Maryland's agricultural resource base. (See ""Contributions of Local Land Conservation Programs"" below.) How MALPF protects the Chesapeake Bay By permanently protecting 228,854 acres of farm and forest land, 98% of which is located in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, MALPF is the second largest contributor, after POS, to achieving the Chesapeake Bay Agreement's goal of protecting 20% of the Bay watershed by 2010. Each easement held by MALPF includes requirements for best management practices (BMPs) for environmentally responsible farming, including vegetative buffers along stream corridors. A forestry management plan is required when 50% or more of an easement property is woodland. The preservation of productive agriculture and forestry is the primary goal of the program, and the protection of water and soil quality is an important element of that goal. Contributions of Local Land Conservation Programs Maryland county governments are national leaders in land conservation. A recent Farmland Preservation Report survey reported that five of the 12 top performing local government agricultural land preservation programs in the nation are in MarylandMontgomery, Carroll, Baltimore, Harford and Frederick Counties. Others in Maryland are close to making the top-twelve list. Several of these and other Maryland counties are also national leaders in preserving open space for recreation and natural resource protection, including those that have outstanding park systems, like Prince George's, Queen Anne's and Montgomery Counties. Together, Maryland Counties have protected more than 103,400 acres of agricultural and woodland through the purchase or transfer of development rights resulting in permanent easements. For example, Maryland counties have protected 60% of all land that is protected throughout the United States with Transfers of Development Rights ordinances. Maryland Counties work closely in partnership with the Maryland Environmental Trust and Departments of Natural Resources and Agriculture in coordinating and matching state funded land preservation programs with local resources and preservation programs. Contributions of Federal Land Conservation Assistance Maryland's land conservation programs utilize a number of federal funding programs for land conservation, which provide significant financial support to increase the State's ability to protect land. These include:  Land and Water Conservation Act (LWCF), National Park Service. Congress adopted this act in 1966 and it utilizes revenues from oil and gas leases of the outer continental shelf for land conservation and parks. While funding for state projects was interrupted for several years during the 1990s, more than $75 million in LWCF funds have been granted to Maryland. POS administers these funds, matches the federal funds with POS transfer tax revenues, and distributes 50% of the federal funds to local jurisdictions according to the POS allocation formula. In FY 2003, POS was apportioned $1,886,043 in LWCF funds. DNR also has utilized a special allocation of LWCF funds for the National Park Service's American Battlefield Protection Program to acquire conservation easements on Civil War sites at Antietam and South Mountain battlefields.  15     Forest Legacy Program (FLP), U.S. Department of Agriculture. The FLP operates in partnership with states, supporting state efforts to protect environmentally sensitive forestlands. Designed to encourage the protection of privately owned forestlands, FLP provides matching funds to acquire conservation easements on private lands in statedesignated Forest Legacy Areas. Administered by the DNR Forest Service, FLP funds are matched by RLP and POS funds, and have acquired easements on 966 acres of productive forests in several parts of the State. Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program (FRPP), U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The NRCS makes awards to state and local governments and private land trusts based on a competitive system utilizing the Land Evaluation Site Analysis. These awards protect prime agricultural lands with conservation easements jointly funded by MALPF, the counties, or other sources. Grant awards from the FRPP were $2,545,000 in FY2002, and $4,900,464 in FY2003, with $4,040,301 of FY2003 grants dedicated to MALPF. North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA), U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service. Several major land conservation projects have been jointly funded in Maryland by NAWCA grants, which are matched by Rural Legacy, Program Open Space and other sources. The grants are used to protect wetlands and other natural habitat for migrating waterfowl as part of international efforts to maintain the North American Flyway along Maryland's Eastern Shore, including Lands End and Chino Farms in Queen Anne's County. TEA21  Transportation Enhancement Funds, Federal Highway Administration and Maryland Department of Transportation. In the past ten years, DNR has utilized more than $8.5 million in funds on a 50%-50% matching basis with POS and TEA21 Transportation Enhancement funds. These funds have been used to acquire fee interests or conservation easements on 41 Civil War sites at Antietam, South Mountain and Monocacy battlefields, totaling about 5,200 acres. Other significant DNR acquisition projects also have been jointly funded with Transportation Enhancement funds, such as Holly Beach in Anne Arundel County and Douglas Point in Charles County. Maryland's local jurisdictions have received more than $11.8 million in Transportation Enhancement funds for land preservation, mitigation of water pollution due to highway runoff, reduction of wildlife mortality, bike and pedestrian facilities, and preservation of abandoned rail lines and historic structures.

The two main categories into which watersheds are sorted and prioritized are Bay Restoration Potential and Forest Ecological Value. Two other categories can be used to further prioritize watersheds by combining them with the two main categories: Forest Economic Value (to the forest products industry) and Vulnerability to land use change. The last two categories can be combined with the first two categories to further prioritize watersheds if desired. For example, combining Forest Ecological Value and Vulnerability allows us to identify the most ecologically valuable watersheds that are also most vulnerable to degradation from future development activities; combining Forest Ecological Value and Forest Economic Value allows us to identify the watersheds that contain the most ecologically valuable forest lands and those forest lands that are most economically valuable to the forest industry. This helps us to focus on areas where, if the forests were lost, there would be a double loss  ecological and water quality services to the public and economic opportunities and jobs to the forest industry. The Bay Restoration Potential category prioritizes watersheds based on their nutrient load contribution to the Bay and it's tributaries, the need and potential for restoration opportunities (e.g. wetland, riparian buffer and Green Infrastructure ""gap"") that help reduce non-point source pollution, and the amount of impervious surface in the watershed (which is an indicator of the magnitude of influence restoration activities will have on water quality). (Figure 1) Detailed information is available in the Appendix  Land Conservation for Water Quality Improvement Potential.  1   The Forest Ecological Value category prioritizes watersheds based on their ability to provide ecological services to the public, such as water quality improvement, wildlife and aquatic habitat, flood storage and reduction, nutrient cycling, etc. (Figure 2). The Ecological Value ranking is based on the Green Infrastructure Assessment methodology applied to all forests in Maryland.  The Forest Economic Value is based on the Maryland Strategic Forest Land Assessment's economic model (Figure 3). It prioritizes all forestlands in Maryland based on their relative economic value to the forest products industry.  2   Vulnerability is the potential for an undeveloped area to be converted to a developed land use by 2020 (Figure 4). This information was created for the Green Infrastructure Assessment and Strategic Forest Land Assessment. It is an indicator of the potential for the loss of natural features, and their functions and values.  The watersheds used in this prioritization methodology are referred to as the ""Maryland 8-digit watersheds"". There are 134 of these watersheds in Maryland and they average 70 square miles in size. Once a watershed or project is selected for a land conservation activity (Figure 5), DNR has the capability to prioritize areas within that watershed or project for implementation of restoration and management activities.  3   For example, ""gaps"" in the Green Infrastructure can be identified and prioritized based on a restoration activity's (e.g. wetland or buffer restoration) ability to contribute to water quality enhancement (Figure 6). The watershed prioritized as high for Bay Restoration Potential would serve as focus areas for integrated delivery of DNR's (and ideally other State agency's) stewardship and restoration programs.  4   Appendix. Methods - Land Conservation for Water Quality Improvement Potential A series of landscape parameters were analyzed at the watershed level to identify and prioritize areas for opportunity to improve water quality. A matrix (see Table 1) was created to show parameters and a ranking scheme. In total, six parameters were used to assess potential to improve water quality. Watershed scale data was developed using Maryland's 8-digit watersheds. There are 134 of these watersheds in the State with an average size of 70 square miles As listed in Table 1, parameters were combined using the outlined ranking to yield a map of watersheds where water quality was typically poor and in need of improvement (see figure 1). Also, data was included to direct restoration efforts toward watersheds where multiple benefits would occur (e.g., Acres of Green Infrastructure gaps, Unforested Riparian Buffer). A brief description and breakdown of the parameters and their justification follows: Water Quality-NPS Nitrogen  A primary target of Chesapeake Bay restoration is the reduction of nitrogen loadings. To help identify sources of nitrogen loading to the Bay, the USGS produced the Spatially Referenced Regressions on Watershed Attributes Model or ""SPARROW"" (Preston and Brakebill 1999). The model identifies sources of nutrients by relating upstream nutrient sources to downstream nutrient loads measured at monitoring stations Percent Unforested Riparian Buffer  The presence of riparian buffer along streams and rivers has been found to provide multiple water quality, aquatic, and terrestrial habitat benefits (Jones et. al 2001, Lowrance et. al 1996). Consequently, reforesting of streamside buffers is an encouraged best management practice (BMP) in watershed restoration. Percent Non-Wetland Hydric Soils - Hydric soils exhibit physical and chemical properties that are commonly associated with being wet for long periods of time (i.e. those that support wetlands). Restoring the hydrology necessary to support a wetland is more likely achieved on hydric soils that are either currently, or once were, wet. A restored wetland can offer multiple benefits such as flood mitigation, groundwater recharge, and sediment and nutrient trapping (Tiner et al. 2000). Percent Impervious Surface  Maryland DNR research has found that impervious surface cover relates to degradation of aquatic resources in watersheds (Broward et. al 1999). Indeed, impervious cover at levels of 3% of a watershed begins to impact fish species such as Brook Trout. At higher levels (e.g., 25%) research suggests that stream channel stability and biology are seriously degraded (CWP 2003). CWAP - Priority Category 1 Watersheds  Maryland developed its Unified Watershed Assessment (MDNR 1998) to identify watersheds needing restoration  5   and protection, respectively referred to as Category 1 and Category 3 watersheds. A further category, Priority Category 1, was created to help better prioritize restoration activities. Watersheds in this category failed to meet half of the benchmarks necessary to indicate a healthy watershed (thereby indicating the need for restoration). Acres of Green Infrastructure Gaps - Maryland's Green Infrastructure Assessment identifies gaps in the statewide hub and corridor network and prioritizes these gaps for forest and wetland restoration (Weber 2003). Many of the parameters used to prioritize gaps for restoration are directly related to anticipated water quality benefits associated with the restoration activity. The total acres of green infrastructure gaps is an indicator of opportunity for restoration aimed at achieving multiple water quality and habitat benefits. Through the use of these parameters, restoration efforts would be directed to those watersheds with non-point source pollution problems and where opportunities exist to implement BMPs aimed at improving water quality. Additionally, restoration through use of BMPs like wetland restoration and riparian reforestation would provide suitable habitat for both terrestrial and aquatic species.

GX146-55-16434115	"Hearing on ""HUD's FY03 Budget and Legislative Proposals.""         Prepared Statement of Mr. Tom Jones  Managing Director, Washington, D.C. Office  Habitat for Humanity International    10:00 a.m., Wednesday, February 13, 2002 - Dirksen 538        Chairman Sarbanes, Ranking Member Gramm, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to represent Habitat for Humanity International.  I am Tom Jones, the Managing Director of the Washington Office of Habitat for Humanity International for the past ten years.  The Washington Office is a part of the Executive Office of Habitat for Humanity International, located in Americus, Georgia.  The Washington Office serves as Habitat for Humanity Internationals presence in the nations capital.  We are privileged to represent Habitat for Humanity International with Congress and the Administration, professional and industry groups, international groups and foreign embassies, other non-profits, labor unions, business corporations, and NGOs.    On behalf of Habitat for Humanity International, I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to testify before the Senate Banking Committee.  The Members of this Committee have shown their commitment to expanding housing opportunities for families seeking to improve the quality of their lives by passing meaningful legislation and holding hearings, such as this one, to determine the appropriate level of federal spending on housing needs.  Many Members of this Committee have actively demonstrated their support for self-help housing and homeownership by building alongside Habitat for Humanity volunteers and homeowners to construct simple, decent Habitat homes.  In fact,  The Houses the Senate Built  program has now recruited sixty United States Senators, including Senator Sarbanes, every single Member of the Housing and Transportation Subcommittee, and Senators Bayh, Johnson, Bennett, and Crapo to build homes in their own states during this year.  Our hope is that this partnership with the Senate will place the issue of affordable housing at the forefront of the nations agenda and raise the awareness of the American public that access to affordable, decent and safe housing is an opportunity every person and family should have.      Secretary Martinez has also reiterated this conviction and shown his unwavering commitment to homeownership, particularly for minorities and low-income personswho fall far behind the nations historic homeownership rates.  It has been an honor to work with the Secretary on several Habitat builds and he and his staff have put in countless hours on their most recent Habitat project,  The House the HUD Secretary Built , in South East Washington, DC.  Habitat for Humanity is firmly committed to working with the Secretary and the Department and with other housing groups, such as the Homeownership Alliance, to increase homeownership opportunities for low-income families and to enable more minorities to take advantage of the nations most vigorous housing market in history.      Habitat for Humanity has spent the past twenty-five years building affordable homes for homeownership in partnership with families who do not qualify for mortgages in the conventional market.  Supported by private donations, government partnerships to ""set the stage,"" volunteer labor and homeowners ""sweat equity,"" the homes are sold for no profit and financed by zero-interest, long-term mortgages that each family can afford.   The average Habitat house selling price was $48,585 in 2000.  In September of that same year, we built our 100,00 th  house worldwide, providing shelter for more than half a million people.  We have now built over 120,000 homes worldwide, with over 42,000 homes built and renovated in the United States, by 1,628 affiliates located in all fifty states.  Habitat is operating in 84 countries worldwide with nearly 500 international affiliates.  We have been named the 15 th  largest homebuilder in the U.S., in units completed, according to Builder Magazine. The national foreclosure rate for a Habitat home is about 1%.       Our homeowner families are typically first-time homebuyers who earn wages below 50 percent of the area median.  Just over 71% of Habitat homeowners are minority and almost half are single parents raising school-aged children.  Homeowners contribute 300500 hours of their own labor in the building of their house and other Habitat homes.  By partnering with Habitat, families are able to move from substandard, deteriorating, overcrowded, and unsafe housing, sometimes even homelessness, into their very own homes they purchase with an affordable mortgage and build with their sweat of their brows.  Homeownership impacts the lives of its homeowners beyond the building of a house:  families gain substantial financial equity, stability for their children, an enhanced sense of pride, safety and dignity, and a legacy to pass to their children.       Homeownership, particularly in areas blighted by disinvestment and economic distress, can be the key to community transformation, one house at a time.  Homeowners are more likely to maintain their properties and be committed to the overall health of their neighborhoods.  Stable housing attracts economic development, favorably impacts school systems, and promotes active community organizations.  While it may not be an option for every family, homeownership is one of the most important building blocks for stronger communities and families.    The success of Habitat for Humanity in creating homeownership opportunities for thousands of Americans who would otherwise never have the chance to own their own home is, in part, due to the generous support of Congress and the Administration.  Since 1996, Congress has appropriated funding for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program, commonly known as SHOP, and the Capacity Building for Habitat for Humanity program, part of the Section 4 Capacity Building funds that benefit other housing and community development organizations. To date, funding received by Habitat for Humanity for SHOP alone will change the lives of over 26,000 peopleincluding almost 17,000 childrenwho would not become homeowners otherwise.  We are deeply grateful for this funding and pleased that the Administration has announced a significant increase in the SHOP program.  The success of the SHOP program speaks for itself and we urge Congress to consider SHOP as an essential piece of the nations overall strategy to expand homeownership to low-income households.    S ELF-HELP HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM (SHOP)   Congress originally authorized the SHOP program in 1996.   It is a competitive grant program, administered by HUD, providing funds to non-profit, self-help housing organizations to ""set the stage"" for building homes below prevailing market rates; money can only be used to purchase land and fund infrastructure expenses, such as streets, utilities, water and sewer connections, and environmental clean-up.   For every $10,000 SHOP award, on average, one home must be constructed.  SHOP families invest 250500 hours in sweat equity and earn below 80% of the area median income.  SHOP funds have been used to complement the work of Habitat affiliates in every state, making it possible for our larger affiliates to build multi-lot Habitat neighborhoods, for fledging, all-volunteer run affiliates to establish regular building programs, and for every affiliate in-between to overcome the largest obstacle to house buildingland and infrastructure expenses.    Habitat for Humanity competes with other non-profit housing organizations for the use of SHOP funds and our affiliates, in turn, compete for the funds awarded to Habitat for Humanity International (HFHI).  Historically, our affiliates requests have exceeded available funds by over 40 percent.  In the past round of FY01 SHOP awards, our affiliates requested $28 million from an available $11 million award from HUD.  HFHI anticipates requests to exceed $30 million from affiliates for the FY02 round of funding, yet to be awarded from HUD.  It is our firm belief that the infusion of even more federal money into the SHOP program will result in a substantial increase in requests from affiliates .    In fact, the most common request we receive in the HFHI/Washington Office from local affiliates all over the country is regarding additional funding for SHOP.       The cost of land and site development has increased so much that affiliates receiving SHOP awards in each of Habitats eight regions far exceeds the average SHOP award; nationally, the combined average of land and infrastructure expenses is $21,720.  This amount must be raised by affiliates before house construction can even begin.      The success of the SHOP program can be measured by numbers of homes produced: with the inclusion of the FY01 awards, when mandated deadlines are met, SHOP funds will result in a total of 7,382 homes.  This translates into 26,132 Americans whose lives have been changedover 16,551 of whom are childrenliving in their own home.  For every $10,000 investment, the dream of homeownership becomes a reality.   SHOP can also be measured by the amount of private resources leveraged.  Habitat affiliates and other self-help housing groups raise an additional four to ten times the amount of the initial investment of $10,000 to construct each house.        The other large user of the SHOP program is the Housing Assistance Council (HAC), a national nonprofit technical assistance organization.  In five SHOP competition rounds since 1996, HUD has awarded $37 million to the Housing Assistance Council.  HAC conducts its own competitions and has passed this funding on to 137 local nonprofits in 40 states, helping 4,368 low-income families build self-help homes using sweat equity, mostly in rural areas.  2,450 of those homes are fully or substantially complete, with the rest in various stages of development.  The families are all first-time homebuyers and put an average of nearly 1,000 hours of sweat equity into their houses.  In most of the local programs, the homebuilding families work together in groups of eight to ten.  They learn about their homes by building them and develop a community by working together.      Some of the local groups that are using HAC's SHOP program include Colorado Housing Inc., Community Action Commission of Fayette County (based in Ohio), Florida Low-Income Housing Associates, Interfaith Housing of Western Maryland, Proyecto Azteca (based in the Texas colonias), Self-Help Enterprises (in rural California), Self-Help Housing Corporation of Hawaii, and Southern Maryland Tri-County Community Action.    Habitat for Humanity and the Housing Assistance Council recommend the following proposal to enhance the effectiveness of the SHOP program:  increase the current limit of $10,000 per unit to at least $15,000 per unit to more accurately reflect the actual cost of acquiring and developing land, and enable the HUD Secretary to determine a higher average, via a waiver, for housing in particular geographic regions where elevated land costs and infrastructure improvements make the cost of acquisition too costly for affordable housing development.  According to our data, the national average per unit cost to ""set the stage"" for building a Habitat house is $21,720 ($10,217 for land and $11,512 for infrastructure).   Data from HAC reveals similar land and development costs of $22,000 per unit.  In some regions of the country, the cost of land and site development is so astronomical that additional resources of four to ten times the amount of a SHOP award is needed before construction on the house can commence, creating serious obstacles for affiliates and other self-help housing developers in the area.  Consider the cost of land and site development for the following Habitat affiliates:         Southern Santa Barbara County Habitat for Humanity -- $112,500.00   Habitat for Humanity of Northern Virginia -- $83,333.00   Arundel, MD Habitat for Humanity -- $28,111.00   Metro Denver Habitat for Humanity -- $35,000.00   Greater Portland, ME Habitat for Humanity -- $47,000   Bend, OR Habitat for Humanity -- $34,250.00   Habitat for Humanity of Suffolk, NY  $38,700.00       The Housing Assistance Council also reports that many of its users of SHOP funds have very high land and site development costs.  Some examples include:         Burbank Housing Development Corp., California --  $40,000.00   Peoples' Self- Help Housing, California -- $50,889.00   Colorado Rural Housing Development Corp. -- $20,265.00   Self-Help Housing Corp. of Hawaii -- $86,765.00   Interfaith Housing of Western Maryland -- $36,306.00   Rural Development Inc., Massachusetts -- $25,600.00   SE Wisconsin Housing Corp.  -- $32,091.00       It is our hope that HUD and Congress will support raising the maximum SHOP award to at least $15,000, as we strongly believe this change will make SHOP even more competitive and attractive to affiliates and other self-help housing groups, who will work even harder to find the additional private resources necessary to pursue their building programs.     CAPACITY BUILDING FOR COMMUNITY-BASED HOUSING GROUPS   Capacity Building is the key to increasing the organizational strength of community-based nonprofits.  The Capacity Building for Habitat for Humanity program, as part of Section 4 Capacity Building funds which benefit notable groups such as LISC and the Enterprise Foundation, enable Habitat affiliates to impact communities on an even more significant scale by jumpstarting house production. Habitat affiliates essentially operate as local Community Development Corporations (CDCs), with their own elected board and 501-c-3 nonprofit statuses.  Many affiliates have no paid staff and must rely on the good will and hard work of volunteers.  Thus the challenge for Habitat for Humanity is to provide technical assistance, training, information, and motivation to increase local building capacity.    The Capacity Building for Habitat for Humanity program, in its fifth year of funding, has been used to:      Provide local volunteers with the skills, training, and knowledge for developing resources through fundraising and securing gifts-in-kind from the private sector---including faith-based organizations, businesses, foundations, civic clubs, labor unions, individuals, and others;   Foster new local, regional, and state official partnerships with organizations and groups such as college and university campus chapters, faith-based groups, civic clubs, prisons, professional groups, including realtors, bankers, home builders, unions, local government, labor, etc. to enhance the productivity of local affiliates;    Recruit and train local volunteers in communication skills and in ways to use media opportunities to raise awareness and the public conscience to eliminate substandard housing and to provide opportunities for every American to achieve the dream of homeownership;   Recruit persons for local board membership who have the leadership skills and the diversity needed and to provide board development opportunities;    Provide funding on a diminishing basis for affiliates to hire first time staff or staff for new positions that contribute to the affiliates growth, so that more people are working at the local level to make housing happen.   Provide training opportunities via electronic, web-based communication to result in securing resources, understanding new methods of construction, discovering sources for training and technical advancement, etc;   Focus efforts on the special housing needs and challenges in Rural Areas, Native American Indian communities, the Colonias, and other populations traditionally underserved by current housing programs and resources;      Within the context of requirements and regulations established for Capacity Building for Habitat for Humanity funds, HFHI also conducts training and development of local affiliates at the local level, working with groups of 30-40 affiliates through its affiliate support system; at the state level in all fifty states; through its eight regional offices; and nationally. The program includes conferences, training events, specialized technical assistance instruction, and provision of leadership at every possible level.  Because the majority of Habitat affiliates are located in rural locations, a major focus is on the unique rural needs for training and technical assistance. Likewise, special focus is made on training and assistance for crucial urban areas where housing needs are so great and which present unique challenges, calling for specialized training and technical assistance.     Like the SHOP program, the success of the Capacity Building for Habitat for Humanity program is measured by the increase in numbers of families housed.  In the first round of the Capacity Building grant program, 60 Habitat affiliates built 1,976 homes over the course of the three-year grant67% more houses than they built in the three years prior to the grant.  In addition, affiliates must match every Capacity Building dollar with three dollars of private, non-governmental funds and increase their building capacity by a minimum of 15%.  This requirement has also been far surpassed; affiliates participating in the 1998 program alone have raised $146 million in private funds to match the $4.5 million in Capacity Building dollars.  It is our hope that Congress will support the Administrations request of $5 million for the Capacity Building for Habitat for Humanity program, as it is crucial to the building efforts of our local affiliates.    SINGLE-FAMILY HOMEOWNERSHIP TAX CREDIT (SFHTC)   While not a part of the HUD budget request, it is important to mention that the Administration has made a significant housing proposal to promote affordable single-family housing development.   Habitat for Humanity strongly supports the Administrations goal to increase homeownership and affordable housing production through a single-family homeownership tax credit, modeled after the highly successful Low Income Housing Tax Credit.  The proposed credit of up to 50 percent for the costs of constructing new homes for homeownership or rehabilitating existing properties for families in low-income urban and rural neighborhoods will enable our local affiliates and other housing developers to bridge the gap between the cost of developing affordable housing and the price that low-income homebuyers can pay for a home.    The proposed tax credit will enable thousands of low-income renters to become first-time homeowners, increase the numbers of homeowners among African American, Hispanic, and other minority families, and help to stabilize rising house prices due to an increase in the production and supply of affordable housing.  The single-family homeownership tax credit is more than a tool to expand homeownership to thousands of families; it is as a catalyst for neighborhood revitalization and community development.  The availability of a new tax credit for homeownership, in addition to other housing programs for low-income families, will expand the range of housing options for families and ultimately result in more families climbing the ladder to wealth and savings.   CONCLUSION   Mr. Chairman, Habitat for Humanity believes that now more than ever, our nation must invest in those sources we value the mostfamily, home, faith, and community.  These are the building blocks of great nations.  To provide stable, affordable, decent homes for more families is perhaps one of the greatest investments the federal government can make to ensure the health and wealth of our nation.  It is our hope that as you review the Administrations FY03 proposal for funding for housing programs for those in this country who can least afford adequate shelter, that you would support additional resources to enable low-income families to move from rental households into homeownership and capacity building assistance for front-line, community-based housing providers.  Thank you for this opportunity to testify.         Home  |  Menu  |  Links  |  Info  |  Chairman's Page"

NEXT MEETING DATE OF FULL CTAC COMMITTEE:  > Wednesday, March 26, 2003   SCOPE of WORK Transportation of the Future: Alternative Concepts A Conceptual Evaluation of an Alternative Mass Intermodal Transit (MIT) System  OBJECTIVE: To examine the opportunities and constraints associated with a novel  concept in providing an alternative to existing conventional travel modes, and to critically examine the potential plausibility of implementing this mixed mode transportation system, the Mass Intermodal Transportation (MIT) system, in Miami-Dade County over the course of the next Long Range Plan planning horizon.  BACKGROUND: Petroleum-based fuels are the overwhelming choice of propellant for current generation powered vehicles of all modes around the world . However, while short -term supplies of oil sources are if not truly plentiful, then at least readily available for perhaps the next century or so, there are only finite reserves remaining; these will, at some point in the relatively near future, be exhausted. Other power sources all have environmental, technological, distributional, or developmental problems despite advances in may areas of science and technology beneficial to power development. Current generation internal combustion engines (ICEs), despite significant improvement over the past three decades, still emit pollutants to varying degrees. And while they have become so efficient that in some cases, engine emissions are less than leeching emissions from tires, fuel and lubricant vents, hoses, and fabrics, they still exhibit tailpipe emissions. And the numbers of vehicles is expanding worldwide, so that gains in pollution reduction may be offset by sheer increase in numbers of vehicles on the road after practical limits of pollution control have been reached. There is also currently a globally minute proportion of electric power generation resulting from the accelerated combustion decomposition (""burning"") of waste materials. Waste materials are a plentiful, and some would say, inexhaustible source as a fuel. Modern combustion equipment incorporates odor and toxinreducing technologies that dramatically reduce pollutants. This may be a promising approach to pursue regarding a low emission, plentiful energy source for providing power. Mass transit systems, generally heavy and light rail systems (HRT and LRT respectively) powered by electric motors, are good -performing and are virtually power plant pollutant free. However, the electrical power consumed in great C:\Documents and Settings\cordero \Desktop\Solana-MIT Concept Study Scope-Synopsis Outline.doc Page 1 of 6   quantities for electric -powered rail operations is usually derived from petro fuels burned at power plants. While advantages accrue in terms of point vs. general area wide sources of pollution, and that the pollutant per capita for such power plants is less than the cumulative emissions of transporting similar numbers of people in a mix of SOVs and MOVs, significant pollutants still result from fossil fuel-powered power plants. And, while offering economies of scale in terms of both energy consumption and pollution reduction, transit still experiences drawbacks in the minds of most when compared to the c urrent US travel modes of choice, the personal vehicle. Transit doesn't go ""everywhere"". Buses have great maneuverability and can access virtually all roadways in any urbanized area, bust must for reasons of schedules and repeatability, adhere to defined routes The situation is both better and worse for fixed guideway systems, depending on location, environment, and technology. When routed along city streets in mixed traffic, Light Rail (LRT) systems, like bus routes, suffer the same woes, experiencing traffic congestion, regardless of their speed capabilities. On the other hand, when fixed guideway systems are routed in exclusive rights of way, they circumvent congestion generally. An exclusive guideway such as the South Miami-Dade Busway allows lon g stretches of congestion -free running at posted speeds. However, cross streets which are jammed may back spill across otherwise clear tracks and slow or halt LRTservice. Underground and/or elevated fixed guideway transit systems are those in which all street congestion is eliminated, and schedules and reliability are improved by magnitudes. These are ideal systems the transit vehicles travel at speed, stopping only at either stations, or to board or let off riders, not being slowed by the congestion they seek to escape. The disadvantages of such system are their accessibility limited to stations, and costs, commensurately more expensive to build that surface systems. Urban public transit modes are not private environments. Transit is, rather, a supremely public environment in which the rider must share space with others, sometimes a rather small space in a rather crowded environment. This deters significant numbers of travelers from otherwise availing themselves of the advantages of transit. There is proposed a novel multimodal/multitechnology approach to power generation and ""distribution"" and concomitant pollution reduction , along with efficiencies of scale offered by transit, while still preserving the personal preferences of individual SOV -based traveling, all virtually simultaneously. The mode proposed for review, consideration , and assessment is known as Mass Intermodal Transit (MIT). MIT is an interrelated system of modes and facilities to simultaneously address urban congestion, urban travel -generated air quality, resource (fuel) conservation, efficiencies of scale, and personal preferences in travel. C:\Documents and Settings\cordero \Desktop\Solana-MIT Concept Study Scope-Synopsis Outline.doc Page 2 of 6   MIT proposes retention of individually-owned vehicles for daily urban commuter and general travel. However, the propulsion technology, and general conformity of these vehicles to a set of uniform design parameters including reduced size would be uniformly common to all such vehicles. The vehicles would be electric cars, electric -powered vehicles (EPVs), known to the profession as EVs. In the `system' proposed for assessment and evaluation via this study, waste cogeneration plants would cleanly burn trash and waste for electricity, the electricity would have a distribution system to power the trains on strategically sited trunk lines, trains that would carry people still in their EVs and cars would be both modes of access and egress. While on -board, patrons could use their time as they like in their own personal environment working, listening to music, reading in silence, conversing with a fellow rider or two. Masses of cars would simultaneous ""board"" at access station and ""alight"" en masse at egress stations. Because the access/egress mode is vehicular, stations needn't always be located close to activity centers, just near good r oadways entering/leaving these centers, perhaps 5 miles distant. While underway, cars would charge their batteries. They would park close to destinations as they now do conventionally, but without traveling long distances for the commute and virtually congesting all roads everywhere during peak periods. The system has drawbacks which need to be explored, as they will during the course of the study. But cleaner, hugely less original resource consumptive, potentially faster, more attractive, and more accessible MIT may be a ""road"" well worth exploring as an alternative to the current generation of travel modes. PREVIOUS WORK: While numerous studies have been conducted investigating novel-to-Miami-Dade travel modes over the past three decades, there has been to local planners knowledge no systematic, serious study of such a novel and synergistic approach to addressing transportation -oriented air quality problems, power consumption, resource depletion, travel, and accessibility concerns.

The document outlines the planning projects that will support the comprehensive and multimodal transportation improvement program approved for the metropolitan area in the Year 2025 Miami-Dade Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP). The MPO's Year 2025 Miami-Dade LRTP was adopted by the Governing Board on December 6, 2001, after considerable official and public review activities were conducted throughout the metropolitan area. The LRTP addresses the multimodal transportation system needs for the period 2005-2025. The work outlined in the UPWP is to be undertaken in a cooperative manner between the various participating Miami-Dade County and regional agencies and the Florida Department of Transportation. This work is guided by policies adhered to by the State of Florida and the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) Governing Board. Guidance from the Federal transportation agencies that support the program is also used as a significant element in the definition of planning projects. Formal technical guidance is provided by the Transportation Planning Council (TPC) of the MPO and the various special TPC committees. Miami-Dade County municipalities are formally requested to review the program prior to its adoption. Citizen participation is ensured through the monthly meetings of the Citizens Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) and hearings held throughout the community during the program period as necessary. The public involvement process is accomplished primarily through tasks 4.05 and 4.14; Citizen and Private Sector Involvement and Public Information Program , respectively. The projects identified in the 2004 UPWP directly address the objectives adopted by the Program Committee and approved by the TPC and the MPO Governing Board. These objectives are in turn based on the policies defined in the urbanized area Transportation Plan and in the Miami-Dade Comprehensive Development Master Plan and are consistent with the transportation goals expressed in the Strategic Policy Regional Plan for South Florida. The program is also consistent with local comprehensive plans adopted by each of the thirty municipalities in the county. In addition, projects in the 2004 UPWP address required work activities and agreed upon issues and priorities. These include but are not limited to: Transportation Equity Act of the 21st Century (TEA-21) planning factors, improvements outlined in the 2025 Long Range Plan, public transportation and ride sharing, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), transportation program funding issues, air quality considerations and the Federal and State Planning Emphasis Areas (PEA). The FY 2004 UPWP also includes the Municipal Grant Program whereby municipalities are granted monies to prepare relevant transportation planning studies. Additional efforts will be made during the FY 2004 to address regional concerns to include, but not limited to, Freight and Goods Movement and Efficient Transportation Decision-Making.  C:\DOCUME~1\cordero\Desktop\  UPWP Executive Summary.lwp  i   New and/or increased funding for FY 2004 has been assigned to new projects or to projects that either have proven underfunded during previous years or need special efforts during the upcoming year.

Local Government.  There are several ways in which the Governor's Smart Growth and Neighborhood Conservation Initiative will allow MDE to enhance its partnership with local government in the coming years. Several of these are discussed in previous sections of this document, such as outreach to local government regarding MDE's targeted use of water and sewer infrastructure financing to support Smart Growth; development of additional state guidance regarding ways to accomplish Smart Growth objectives through the use of local 10-year water and sewer plans; and greater assistance to local jurisdictions in ensuring that local transportation plans achieve ""conformity"" with the state air quality plan in ways that contribute to Smart Growth.    Another way in which MDE's interaction with local government can be enhanced is through work aimed at accomplishing the dual objectives of Smart Growth and Chesapeake Bay Restoration and Protection. Important mechanisms in this regard are the existing Chesapeake Bay Tributary Strategy Teams which include representation by local government. This approach is briefly described below.    Chesapeake Bay Tributary Strategies Process.  The Tributary Strategies can provide several means for advancing Smart Growth objectives, especially for the outreach components. Involvement of the Tributary Teams also provides a mechanism for focusing on the environmental rationale, both for pounds of nutrients reduced or prevented, and probably for habitat protected for specific State Smart Growth actions.    River Basin Commissions.  Regarding the development of MDE's Smart Growth Plan, there are two river basin commissions of greatest interest: the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission. These Commissions provide two Smart Growth opportunities: (1) they provide a venue through which MDE can educate neighboring states about growth issues in general, and Smart Growth in particular, and (2) the Commissions can help MDE deal with interstate or regional issues related to Smart Growth, such as water appropriations and nutrient loads to shared river segments. If MDE can successfully accomplish the first, progress toward the second should follow. As Smart Growth proceeds, part of MDE's intent is to lead the way by showing that growth issues can be dealt with successfully, and the political issues overcome.    One issue MDE should be prepared to discuss is the issue of interstate/interjurisdictional equity and competition. For example, how can Smart Growth be used to prevent putting Maryland's Washington metropolitan area at a competitive disadvantage with its northern Virginia neighbors for jobs? (This issue has already come up in the Tributary Strategies context with respect to spending on wastewater treatment system upgrades.)    Metropolitan Planning Organizations.  MDE frequently interacts with the two metropolitan planning organizations in Maryland — the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG) and the Baltimore Regional Council of Governments (BRCOG). This interaction is typically with regard to transportation planning/air quality issues and water quality protection. Section V., Goal 6 describes the ongoing engagement of these organizations concerning MDE's transportation/air quality plan ""conformity"" effort. Regarding water quality protection, MDE and the metropolitan agencies coordinate on issues such as watershed protection and municipal wastewater treatment initiatives.    Where Do We Want To Be?    We want to be in a position where the members of the Tributary Teams, the local government liaisons to the Teams, and the members of the other organizations we work with, are familiar with the concepts of Smart Growth and willing to apply those concept to their various missions, both on the Teams for example, and back in the local government or regional (e.g., COG or BMC) offices.    How Do We Get There?    Education.  The Governor's Chesapeake Bay Cabinet meets approximately twice a year with the Tributary Team Chairs. As time for the next meeting approaches, MDE proposes that the Cabinet heads introduce the Smart Growth ideas and the need for the Teams to consider them at the next meeting. This will help reinforce the link between Smart Growth and the Bay clean-up effort.    The next necessary task is to educate the State liaisons to all the Teams on the key aspects of Smart Growth, and have them brainstorm with MOP as how best to apply these ideas to the Tributary Strategy process.    The next task is to convert these ideas into a uniform presentation that the State liaisons can use to present the ideas to the Teams. At the least, this presentation should include:      Smart Growth components (i.e., Smart Growth, Rural Legacy, Brownfields);    Current state strategies for implementing Smart Growth;    How the Tributary Teams could advance Smart Growth (from the brainstorming session above) initial ideas are:      How growth affects nutrient loads (septics, atmospheric, etc.)    How growth affects sewage treatment plant flows and loads (e.g., loading cap, reaching design flow, need for BNR at minor plants, etc.)    How growth affects habitat and riparian buffers          The Teams also provide an opportunity to hear what the counties are doing with respect to Smart Growth. We should ask the Team Chairs to work with the Coordinators and develop a component of each meeting, or at least alternate meetings, where the county contacts report on ideas from their counties on how to advance the Smart Growth objectives and what they are doing.    Modification of the Strategies to Explicitly Include ""Smart Growth"".  Part of the Tributary Teams' charge is to modify the Strategies as needed or appropriate to meet their goal. The only part of the Strategies that is final, is the loading goal. Although any modifications will need to be suggested and recommended by the Teams themselves, if MDE can assist them in finding ways to incorporate Smart Growth through the process described above, they may incorporate Smart Growth explicitly in the Resource Protection and Watershed Planning portion of the Strategy, which currently includes: buffers, shore erosion control, marine pump outs, etc. It could also be implicit in changes made to the developed or agricultural land goals, although these would be more difficult to track.    Local Governments.  There are typically several local government representatives on each team, depending on how many counties there are in the watershed. State liaisons could meet separately with the county contacts for more technical and intensive discussions. MDE can use the Tributary Strategies connection to help local government staff better understand how they might connect their comprehensive plans with the Strategies, especially emphasizing the cost savings of controlling growth with respect to the need for and maintenance of stormwater facilities, capital improvements to wastewater treatment systems, and difficulties with future growth if they exceed the nutrient cap. This is also an opportunity to showcase the GIS overlays developed under Tributary Strategy IV.    Finding Other Opportunities Through Interaction.  The River Basin Commissions themselves can probably provide the greatest insight into how they might participate. Getting a discussion of Smart Growth on their agendas, with a brainstorming session to develop ideas for Commission advancement of Smart Growth, perhaps within a broader context of sustainability, should also be useful.    Incorporating Smart Growth into Agreements with the River Basin Commissions.  For all new agreements, contracts, studies, funding, etc., MDE should review the contracts or memoranda for opportunities to insert Smart Growth language and concepts. In some instances, it may be possible to require consideration of Smart Growth approaches. In addition, the Bay Program frequently contracts with ICPRB and sometimes with SRBC or provides grants to those Commissions. MDE should formally request that the Bay Program also require language consistent with Maryland's Smart Growth policies in all relevant contracts.    Metropolitan Planning Organizations.  Like the river basin commissions, metropolitan planning organizations represent another avenue for MDE to pursue when it comes to emphasizing smart growth approaches. Funding and other cooperative agreements that MDE has with these agencies can be reviewed in the future with an eye toward incorporating smart growth strategies as appropriate.    How Do We Measure Our Progress?    In addition to efforts involving local government and regional organization mentioned elsewhere in MDE's plan, specific milestones for initial efforts under section V., Goal 8 include:      Bay Cabinet presentation to Bay Tributary Team chairs;    Educating Team liaisons and ""brainstorming"" with MOP, senior MDE and DNR personnel, and local government representatives to find ways for the Teams to apply smart growth concepts;    Presentations to the Bay Tributary Teams;    Team responses;    Presentations to river basin commissions and regional planning organizations;    Review cooperative agreements with commissions and regional planning organizations to identify opportunities to incorporate smart growth approaches.      Outreach    Outreach to the agencies and organizations described in this section will be primarily through staff presentations during the course of routine meetings and workshops that MDE engages in which involve these groups throughout the year.

GX263-84-4031034	"UPDATE INDUSTRY Biweekly Period Ending June 1, 2002 Phoenix Metro Area Trade An icon in Valley and Arizona mall development was sold for nearly $1.5 billion in late May. Macerich Co. of Santa Monica, Calif., purchased Westcor Realty, developer and owner of eight malls throughout the state (including recently opened Gateway Mall in Prescott and Chandler Fashion Center) and dozens of Phoenix-area shopping centers. Westcor was formed more than three decades ago by three local real estate developers who have been able to create unique and highly profitable properties that enjoy average-salesper-square-foot rates much higher than the national average. Macerich is one of the 10 largest owners of malls in the country. In related news, Westcor-owned Superstition Springs Mall in east Mesa will undergo a $2.7 million make over and other changes, while Home Depot will open its first Expo Design Center in Arizona at Westcor's planned Scottsdale 101 shopping center in northeast Phoenix. In addition to the make over -- which includes giving the 12-year-old mall a more upscale look -- the shopping center will add 50,000 square feet of space, allowing it to add about 10 stores to its current total of 130. Also, the Superstition Springs' Disney Store, one of five in the Valley, is among 150 locations nationwide closing because of subpar performance. Renovations at the mall are expected to be completed by November. ... The 100,000square-foot Expo store, which sells a variety of home furnishings (excluding furniture), will anchor 600,000 square feet of retail space on 70 acres at Scottsdale Road and Loop 101. Scottsdale 101 will also feature a 20-screen Harkins Theater, plus as-yet-tobe-named sporting-goods, electronics, and furniture stores. RMB Enterprises plans to open about a dozen Seattle's Best Coffee locations in the Valley within the next year-and-a-half. A bitter (not taste wise) rival of Starbucks, also based in Seattle, the chain already has one store at the Chandler Fashion Center in Chandler and will shortly open stores in Ahwatukee, Mesa, and Gilbert. If coffee isn't your cup of tea, the stores will also feature a wide variety of pastries. Another hot, rather ""cold"" franchise, is Scottsdale-based Cold Stone Creamery, which is eating its way into the hearts of customers across the country. Now 250 franchise stores strong and projected to grow to 1,000 stores by 2004, the 14-year-old chain's 65 administrative employees are currently searching for larger quarters than their current home at Scottsdale Airpark. Two new east Valley stores were expected to open in June -- one at Gainey Village in Scottsdale and another at Arizona State University in Tempe. Services To provide more flexibility in its workforce during periods of strong and slack demand, a Bloomington, Minn.-based software company said it will lay off about 150 software developers at its Mesa operation over the next several months. NCS Pearson, which employs about 6,000 worldwide and 400 locally (prior to the layoffs), said it will farm out the software-development jobs to an India subcontractor, which in turn will hire workers on a temporary and contract basis. Partly offsetting the job loss, NCS Pearson --   which develops software for educational, government, and data-management tasks -- said it is hiring 30 new software engineers in Mesa for a different project. Some of those being laid off will likely be hired for those positions. About 40 former employees of Arthur Andersen's Valley operations have been hired by ""Big 5"" accounting competitor Deloitte & Touche. Andersen has lost most of its major corporate accounts in Arizona -- and laid off an unspecified number of its 500 Phoenix-area employees -- since its involvement with the Enron financial scandal became known earlier this year (see May 4, 2002, Industry Update). Deloitte & Touche now employs about 200 people at its Phoenix office (Central Avenue and Thomas Road). The brother of actor James Earl Jones -- who is famous for his voice as Darth Vader of ""Star Wars"" fame -- is bringing his Los Angeles production company and potentially scores of jobs (e.g., actors, caterers, movie crews) to Phoenix. Lured by good weather and cheaper production and labor costs, Mathew Earl Jones said his Blacktop Films LLC is involved with making television shows and full-length feature movies. Jones plans to also hire a local staff. May the force be with him. Tucson Metro Area Manufacturing IBM's Storage Systems Division in Tucson will share in its parent company's pain, absorbing about 70 of the 2,000 layoffs nationally announced by the computer giant in late May. With around 1,600 people, the Tucson unit will lose about 3 percent of its workforce. Some of those laid off will have an opportunity to apply for jobs created by a recently announced multi-year business alliance with Hitachi Ltd. of Japan to shorten the time to build the next generation of storage devices (see April 20, 2002, Industry Update).  Work began in mid-May on a 72,000-squarefoot addition to the University of Arizona Science and Technology Park (Interstate 10 and Rita Road), home to 32 high-tech companies employing 6,200 people. An $8.2 million office building, expected to open in summer of 2003, will be the first of a threepart expansion to the 1,345-acre research park. The second and third phases will include a 250- to 300-room hotel and laboratory building. A neighbor of the research park, Slim-Fast Foods, expects to open a 550,000-square-foot plant in early July with a staff of 70 workers. The diet-food maker, which chose Tucson over several other western cities for its second U.S. manufacturing facility, plans to eventually employ 170 people at the $100 million plant. Pay will range from $11.70 an hour for warehouse workers to $49 an hour for managers. Slim-Fast is a subsidiary of Unilever, a Dutch/British consumer-goods conglomerate that also owns Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Lipton tea, and Hellmann's mayonnaise. Trade Work is progressing on a 55,000-square-foot Safeway grocery store in Sahuarita (Duval Mine Road and La Canada Drive), about 10 miles south of Tucson, while Wal-Mart is expected to expand its existing 71,000square-foot store on the east side of Interstate 19 into a ""supercenter."" The Safeway, which is expected to open in late August or early September, will be part of a 366,000square-foot parcel that will also include a Safeway service station and other retail stores. As of late May, it appeared Wal-Mart was going ahead with plans to build a 150,000- to 160,000-square-foot store. Services Also in Sahuarita, owners of the three-yearold Civano Nursery Garden Center hope a $3 million investment will ""make money grow from trees"" and in the process create 80 jobs for local residents. When the 70-acre Civano Nursery Sahuarita Farm is completed over   Industr y Update (Cont.) Biweekly Period Ending June 1, 2002  the next two years, the company expects to harvest 50,000 trees for local builders and homeowners who now obtain their landscaping from the Phoenix area. Using a drip-irrigation water system that needs about onethird less water than normal to grow trees, the tree farm will be located in two 190,800square-foot, computer-controlled warehouses. To help its customers adapt to a 21st century economy, Goodwill Industries of Southern Arizona has expanded its mission beyond selling used clothing. The 100-year-old organization now offers 120 hours of free training for the teleservices industry to individuals who are unemployed or underemployed. In most cases, graduates of the training will be offered a job with a local call center. To qualify for the program, participants must also have a high school degree or a GED and be able to r ead and write at an 8th-grade level. For more information about the program, call 520-623-5174 or visit the organization's web site: www.aappd.com/ statesetaside/providers/goodwill_industries. htm. Tucson's largest midwife practice was expected to lose its home due to the shutdown of the Birth & Women's Health Center in early June. After relinquishing its contract with Health Net -- because the health insurer wanted to cut fees by 15 percent -- the women's center was not able to financially recover. About 20 percent of the center's patients used Health Net. The 20-year-old facility has delivered about 5,000 babies, costing patients about half as much charged by local hospitals. Balance of State Construction Granite Investment & Development LLC, headed by two former Del Webb presidents, plans to build a 1,200-home master-  planned community in Chino Valley (north of Prescott). Granite will ask local and national builders to participate in the project. No start date has been given for development of the community. Trade A California developer involved with several other Yuma projects plans to buy and double the size of Southgate Mall. Craig Clark, who is currently developing the city's municipal complex and expects to work on Yuma's riverfront project, wants to purchase the 275,000-square-foot mall from Melvin Simon and Associates by Sept. 1. The 30-year-old mall, which underwent a $5 million remodeling in 1993, would see a number of new stores, in addition to the expansion of existing chain stores, such as Dillard's, J.C. Penney, and Sears. Services Work has begun on expansion of the Riverside Resort Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nev., which is across the Colorado River from Bullhead City, Ariz. The project includes a two-story, 20,000-square-foot addition to the hotel's casino and a 190,000-squarefoot covered parking garage. Work is expected to be completed late this year or in early 2003.   UPDATE INDUSTRY Industry Update is produced biweekly as a stand-alone publication and quarterly as part of Arizona Economic Trends by the Arizona Department of Economic Security, Research Administration.

GX234-87-2370381	"Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Project Overview Recently, a number of communities in Miami-Dade County have expressed interest in establishing local transit circulator services to improve mobility and provide connections to the regional transit system. These types of services can serve local trips within a community and typically serve neighborhoods and areas not served by the County's transit system. Transit circulators offer significant potential toward improving the mobility of local communities' residents, employees, and visitors. Other benefits associated with transit circulators may include (1) easing traffic congestion by providing an alternative to the personal automobile for travel and (2) providing a transportation opportunity for a number of mobility-deprived citizens. Several communities in Miami-Dade County already provide transit circulators including Miami Beach, North Miami Beach, and Aventura. Studies have been performed in several other communities and the implementation of circulator services is under serious consideration; however, no general policies or procedures exist to assess the feasibility of establishing these services. In response to Miami-Dade County Miami Beach Electrowave communities' interest in establishing or helping to fund local transit circulators and the lack of procedures for assessing the feasibility and planning for these services, the Miami-Dade Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) initiated the Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study. The two main objectives of this study were (1) to develop a set of guidelines and standards for establishing local transit circulator services and (2) to develop measures of effectiveness (MOEs) for evaluating these services.  Research and Data Collection Recent planning studies for local transit circulators in Miami-Dade County were reviewed and a database was compiled for existing local transit circulator systems. A number of common themes and consistent elements were identified in these planning studies. The typical recommended services were neighborhood circulators operating on local streets with links to the County's transit system. High-density areas with mixed land uses were regarded as the most ideal environment for instituting local transit circulator service. Target populations of potential riders included senior citizens, students, and low-income workers. Data were collected from existing transit circulator systems and a transit circulator database was developed. In addition to obtaining data from Miami-Dade communities that provide circulator Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Executive Summary  ES-1   services, data were compiled from a number of communities in Broward County, Florida, and from three communities outside of South Florida to provide a wider perspective on these types of services. .  Transit Circulator Survey County and municipal staffs were surveyed to determine interest in establishing local transit circulators and to identify issues that may affect the establishment of these services. A transit circulator survey was developed to identify communities in Miami-Dade County interested in establishing or expanding transit circulator services. The survey also obtained data on existing transit circulators in the communities that offer these services. Surveys were sent to 35 communities, including 30 Miami-Dade County municipalities and 5 municipalities from outside the County. The survey was returned by 22 (63 percent) of these communities, including ten communities with existing transit circulators. According to municipal staff, reaction to transit circulators has been extremely positive in the communities that provide these services. In addition, the survey found that several communities were in the process of establishing circulators or were at least considering establishing circulators.  Data Analysis The database of existing local transit circulators and results of the survey were analyzed to identify conditions and service characteristics that may be required for establishing these services. Results of the data analysis indicate that an Miramar Community Shuttle Bus elderly population may provide a significant ridership base for community circulators, especially in communities with smaller overall populations. Surprisingly, circulator service is more widespread in municipalities with higher per capita incomes; these communities tend to have more funds available to subsidize the circulator service. Four different types of circulator routes were identified: Downtown circulators Neighborhood circulators Park-ride and feeder circulators Shopping-based/""lifeline"" circulators The type of transit circulator route is dictated by a community's transit needs, which are driven by the community's socioeconomic and geographic characteristics. Downtown circulator routes are often offered in downtowns, outlying business districts and high employment areas; neighborhood circulators are often located in suburban municipalities with lower population densities; park-ride and feeder circulator routes serve peak period commuter needs; shoppingbased or ""lifeline"" circulators typically operate in municipalities that have high proportions of elderly citizens. Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Executive Summary  ES-2   Development Guidelines and Standards for Local Circulator Services A generalized approach for developing and monitoring the performance of local transit circulators was established. General circulator potential location. policy and legal issues associated with the implementation of municipal transit services were examined and broad guidelines were developed for application to all municipal circulator services, regardless of the type of service being considered or Factors considered included: Role of municipal circulator services Interlocal agreement Risk management Federal/state regulations Section 13(c) labor protection Americans with Disabilities Act A list of general policy and legal issues municipalities should follow when planning transit circulator service was developed and is shown below.  General Policy and Legal Issues Guide 1. Municipalities should provide localized services and MDT will provide broader countywide service. 2. Municipalities that establish circulator service must enter into an interlocal agreement with Miami-Dade County. 3. Municipalities must be aware of the liability associated with operating a municipal circulator service and hold harmless the County from liabilities and claims. If the circulator service is contracted to a private transportation provider, the County must be named as an additional insured on the policy. 4. Municipalities must comply with all federal, state, and local regulations regarding the provision of transit services. 5. Municipal circulator service should complement - not compete with - MDT service, so as not to endanger Section 13(c) protected employees. 6. All transit circulator vehicles must be ADA compliant.  Two-Step Planning Process In addition, a two-step planning process was developed as a model for municipalities to follow when considering and planning local transit circulator services. ""Step One"" is the initial planning effort during the development of local transit circulator services. A scorecard of weighted attributes was developed for ""Step One"" to assist municipalities in evaluating the feasibility of establishing circulator services.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Executive Summary  ES-3   Step-One Initial Service Proposal Evaluation Elements 1. Indicators of transit dependency or propensity to use circulators including assessment of ranges of population density, percentage of elderly residents, household income level, and personal automobile unavailability. 2. Indicators of recognizable gaps in transit service in the community. 3. Indicators of activity centers in the community that are not served or are underserved by transit. 4. Indicators of relatively frequent requests or calls for community transit circulator services. 5. Indicators of municipal support for contributing funds for the initial feasibility study. 6. Indicators of municipal support for contributing funding the actual circulator services.  Step-Two Detailed Feasibility Assessment Framework ""Step Two"" of the planning process provides a more detailed feasibility assessment framework that should only be undertaken if ""Step One"" indicates that transit circulator service is feasible. The purpose of ""Step Two"" is to assist in developing operations, management, and financial plans for the circulator service. Although each community has specific mobility needs and unique socioeconomic and geographic characteristics, a number of general recommendations for developing circulator services were provided as guidance in this step. Some of these recommendations are shown below. Circulator routes should be fairly direct and not try to serve all community mobility needs; shorter circulators tend to attract more passengers per revenue hour. Headways of 30 minutes or shorter are strongly recommended for municipalities that are serious about providing a viable transportation alternative for their residents. Circulator schedules and routes should be coordinated with the schedules and routes of other transit providers to provide ""timed-transfer networks,"" whenever feasible. ""Timedtransfer points"" are especially important when headways are infrequent. Public input should be obtained during the planning stage to determine operating parameters desirable from the standpoint of the potential riders. Circulator vehicles should be easily distinguishable from Miami-Dade Transit buses and be identifiable as a separate municipal transit service. Major capital investment may be avoided and implementation may be hastened by contracting the municipal transit service to a private transportation provider; however, a municipality that operates the transit circulator service internally may take a more active role and may become more intrinsically involved with ensuring the system's success. Marketing strategy is vital for building community awareness of and support for a circulator system and attracting ridership. Funding for municipal circulator service may be obtained from a number of local, state, federal, and private sources; however, these funding sources are highly competitive and most are not indefinitely available. Municipalities typically fund the majority of costs associated with ongoing, successful transit circulator services internally.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Executive Summary  ES-4   Post-Implementation Monitoring After a municipal transit circulator is implemented, evaluation of the system's performance is needed to ensure the public's mobility needs are served. Continuing performance monitoring also assists in adjusting services for efficiency and effectiveness. A critical component of the post-implementation monitoring program is maintaining a public outreach program, as public involvement is important to help define the role of the circulator system in the community. The municipality should also perform an evaluation of the municipal transit circulator service at least on an annual basis; often a monitoring process and annual evaluation is a requirement of funding agencies. Performance and service goals should be established for review during the annual evaluation process and measurable objectives should be developed for assessment. Typical performance measures include annual passengers per route, passengers per revenue hour, costs per passenger, and on-time performance. Examples of useful applications of the monitoring process include revising or adding new routes, adjusting headways, and modifying hours of operation.  Conclusion Currently, Miami-Dade County sometimes assists with the planning for local transit circulators and municipalities receive grants from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) or other agencies to initiate the circulator service. However, grant support often expires after a period of two to three years and municipalities then must obtain funding from other sources or discontinue the circulator service if new funding sources cannot be secured. The objective of the Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study was to provide guidelines Aventura Advantage Shuttle Bus for municipalities to follow when planning local transit circulators. This study provides a framework that will (1) provide Miami-Dade municipalities with a good screening and assessment tool for considering local transit circulators and (2) allow Miami-Dade County to better evaluate requests for assistance in planning and establishing municipal transit circulators. Municipalities can benefit from this study by following the recommended planning process to first determine if transit circulator service is feasible and, if the service is assessed as feasible, to develop a circulator system that serves the community's mobility needs with an improved chance of continued success.

INTRODUCTION Miami-Dade Transit (MDT) offers a wide range of transit services in Miami-Dade County including Metrobus, Metrorail, and Metromover. MDT is the largest transit provider in Florida and the sixteenth largest public transit operator in the United States. Metrobus alone operates over 600 buses on 82 routes. Most of the County's population has reasonable access to the Metrobus routes; however, Metrobus routes primarily travel along major thoroughfares and its service focuses primarily on grid system transportation needs. Although the County's transit system provides a transportation alternative for many residents, some areas cannot easily access the regional system and local trips within a community are not always well served. One option to accommodate trips not served by the County's transit system is to provide community transit circulators or shuttles. These types of services can serve local trips within a community and typically serve neighborhoods and areas not served by the County's transit system. Transit circulators offer significant potential toward improving the mobility of local communities' residents, employees, and visitors. Other benefits associated with the transit circulators may include (1) easing traffic congestion by providing an alternative to the personal automobile for travel and (2) providing a transportation opportunity for a number of mobilitydeprived citizens. Recently, a number of communities in Miami-Dade County have expressed interest in establishing local transit circulator services to improve mobility and provide a connection to the regional transit system. Several communities in Miami-Dade County already provide transit circulators including Miami Beach, North Miami Beach, and Aventura. Studies have been performed in other communities and the implementation of circulator services is under serious consideration; however, no general policies or procedures exist to assess the feasibility of establishing these services. In response to Miami-Dade County communities' interest in establishing or helping to fund local transit circulators and the lack of procedures for assessing the feasibility and planning for these services, the Miami-Dade Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) has initiated the Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study. The two main objectives of this study were (1) to develop a set of guidelines and standards for establishing local transit circulator services and (2)  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  1   to develop measures of effectiveness (MOEs) for evaluating these services. The following tasks were addressed in the development of this project: Data Collection and Research  recent feasibility studies for establishing local transit circulators in Miami-Dade County were reviewed and a database was compiled for existing local transit circulators Survey  County and municipal staffs were surveyed to determine interest in establishing local transit circulators and to identify issues that may affect the establishment of these services Data Analysis  the database of existing local transit circulators was analyzed to identify conditions and service characteristics that may be required for establishing these services Development of Guidelines and Performance Standards for Local Transit Circulator Services  procedures for developing and monitoring the performance of local transit circulators were established. This technical memorandum summarizes the data collection and research task. Additional  technical memoranda were prepared for the other tasks as they were completed throughout the study process. These technical memoranda appear as subsequent chapters of this report.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  2   II. REVIEW OF RECENT MPO TRANSIT CIRCULATOR STUDIES Six transit circulator studies were prepared for the Miami-Dade MPO between 1996 and 2000. These studies were reviewed to develop a better understanding of local experience in implementing transit circulator services. These studies include the following: Miami Surface Shuttle Services: Feasibility Study for Transit Circulator Services in Downtown Miami, Brickell, Overtown, and Airport West North Miami Community Transit Circulator Study North Miami Beach Circulator Services City of Hialeah Circulator Study Aventura Municipal Transit Study Electric Transit Circulator Feasibility Study Summaries of these individual studies are presented next, followed by a summary of common elements in the studies. A. Miami Surface Shuttle Services: Feasibility Study for Transit Circulator Services in Downtown Miami, Brickell, Overtown, and Airport West The Miami Surface Shuttle Services: Feasibility Study for Transit Circulator Services in Downtown Miami, Brickell, Overtown, and Airport West was completed in June 2000. This study was prepared for the Miami-Dade MPO by the Center for Urban Transportation Research (CUTR) and it evaluated the feasibility of designing and funding local transit circulator services. In particular, this study examined the feasibility of establishing surface shuttle services in the following areas: Flagler Street corridor in Downtown Miami from the Miami River to Biscayne Boulevard Brickell community on the south side of the Miami River Overtown community to the north of the Flagler Street corridor ""Airport West,"" which is bound by NW 74th Street/Okeechobee Road to the north, SW 7th Street to the south, the Florida Turnpike to the west, and LeJeune Road to the east. Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  3   This study provided a number of viable options for circulator routes in the study areas and concluded that this type of service is ""truly exciting and could help the development of the downtown area significantly, and give public transit a new and positive image in the area."" The study indicated the key to establishing this type of service will be securing funding sources. The combined operating costs  not including capital expenses  for circulator services in all four study areas range from $1,044,000 to $2,819,000 per year. Circulator service was recommended to be implemented in phases beginning immediately with the Brickell area. Shuttle services along Flagler Street should be delayed until the improvements associated with the ""Flagler Marketplace"" plan are completed. These improvements include changing Flagler Street from one-way to two-way operations, streetscape, and rerouting large buses to other streets in the downtown. Shuttle service in the Overtown area was recommended to start with the implementation of redevelopment activities along NW 3rd Avenue. In the ""Airport West"" additional shuttle routes are recommended to increase service during the midday. Future routes could be added to the ""Airport West"" in the morning and afternoon peak periods. This study also examines options for operating the shuttle services, vehicle technology options, and potential funding sources. There are several options for potential service providers including MDT, the City of Miami, the Transportation Management Association (TMA) of the Downtown Development Authority (DDA), and the Transportation Management Initiative for the ""Airport West."" Vehicle technology options include minibuses, low floor buses, traditional fixed route buses, and alternative fuel vehicles. Minibuses are the preferred vehicle type because of their neighborhood-friendly size and ability to maneuver through residential neighborhoods. Low floor buses are preferable because boarding and alighting are easier, particularly for the elderly and disabled. A comprehensive list of potential funding sources is provided including Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) funding programs, federal funding programs, and local funding sources. B. North Miami Community Circulator Study The North Miami Community Transit Circulator Study, ""Pre-Community Input Interim Report"" was completed in February 1999. This report was prepared for the City of North Miami by PRL & Associates. Funding for this study was provided by the Miami Dade MPO through the Unified Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  4   Planning Work Program (UPWP) Municipal Grant Program. This study presents a preliminary analysis of the need and feasibility of implementing transit circulator services in the City to integrate with and enhance existing transit services. The transit circulator would target the three segments of the population with the greatest mobility need: senior citizens, students, and commuters. In the ""Existing Conditions"" chapter, the report summarizes the current state of conditions that leads to the need for transit services. This chapter includes the following sections: Land Use Analysis Identification of Major Generators and Attractions Demographics Existing Transit Services Roadway Conditions Based on the existing conditions data, the needs of the target populations were identified. Transit demand characteristics were examined from surveys conducted by MDT in 1993 and 1994. Surveys included both an on-board survey and a random telephone survey. best meet the needs of the target riders and overall community. C. North Miami Beach Circulator Services The North Miami Beach Circulator Services ""End of Year Report"" was completed in September 1998. This report presents monitoring and evaluation of the City's circulator service. In 1996 the Northeast Dade Transit Improvement Study (NEDTIS) recommended developing circulator services for North Miami Beach and the phasing out of service from regional routes through neighborhoods as circulators were established. The City received funding through the MPO Municipal Grant in fiscal year (FY) 1996 to analyze the economic, environmental, and traffic impacts of circulator services; and to identify potential circulator routes. In May 1997 the City selected Handivan to operate its circulator services. operating on May 27, 1997. These circulator services began Attitudinal information obtained from the transit surveys was used to identify service characteristics that will  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  5   North Miami Beach initially implemented two separate routes using minibuses with a seating capacity of 20 passengers. A third route was added in February 1998. The City began charging fares consistent with the MDT fare structure in August 1997. Although the City expected a decrease in ridership with the initiation of fares, there was no significant impact. This may be related to the fact that many elderly riders have ADA cards and ride for free. The FDOT established a minimum daily ridership level for this project of 85 daily boardings for each route within three years. In September 1998 the three routes were operating below this established ridership level with 42.0, 3.0, and 17.8 daily boardings. The City developed the following strategies to improve ridership: Development of a marketing plan - marketing in the first year was limited to public meetings at neighborhood centers and condominiums Coordination with MDT to initiate implementation of NEDTIS recommendations such as bus stop enhancements (benches and shelters) Investigation of the feasibility of creating a TMA to manage and coordinate the transit services provided in Northeast Miami-Dade County D. City of Hialeah Circulator Study The City of Hialeah Circulator Study was completed in October 1998. This study was prepared for the City of Hialeah by Carr Smith Corradino and was funded through the MPO Municipal Grant Program. This study recommended implementing a circulator service in the City of Hialeah. The ""Hialeah Circulator"" would provide local community transit service that complements the regional service provided by MDT. As part of the study, the City applied to FDOT for the Public Transit Service Development Program Funds. Transit generators in Hialeah are identified including shopping centers, industrial parks, highdensity housing, elderly housing, government centers, hospitals, and recreation facilities. Senior citizens, income-disadvantaged, and youths were targeted as the primary users. A system of two circulator routes with a central transfer point is recommended. Service should be provided at 30minute headways and the service span should be 12 hours on weekdays and 8 hours on weekends. Three options are presented for operating the circulator service: (1) the City could provide all service, which would require hiring and training drivers and support personnel, acquiring Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  6   vehicles, and providing maintenance, (2) acquiring the vehicles and contracting all or a portion of administration, operations, and maintenance, or (3) contracting out the service  including vehicles. This report estimates that over 1,000,000 annual passenger trips would be provided by the service if the recommended operating span, headways, and fares ($0.75) were adopted. First-year costs including buses and operating costs are estimated at $2,240,800. Fares are expected to provide $803,760 in revenue. E. Aventura Municipal Transit Study The Aventura Municipal Transit Study was completed in July 1998. This study was prepared for the City of Aventura by Bermello, Ajamil & Partners, Inc. and it recommends fixed route circulator service with three different routes: a northern route, a central route, and a southern route. ""Skip-stop service"" was recommended, which would serve condominiums on alternate routes. Some advantages of the ""skip-stop service"" recommended in this study include the following: Shorter travel times  travel time is considerably shorter for each passenger to reach major destinations Minimal communications  there are fixed routes and standard schedules Easy to understand schedules  there will be clockface (every location is served at the same time every hour of the day) headways in the north and central service areas Reduced layovers  a short layover at the Aventura Mall may potentially minimize congestion Service was recommended from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Monday through Friday. Saturday service from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM was identified as an option the City may want to consider. This report recommends contracting the operation of the entire service to a public or private transit service provider to avoid a major capital investment. Low floor minibuses with between 14 to 20 passenger seating capacity were recommended. Annual costs for operating this system were estimated at $211,000.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  7   F. Electric Transit Circulator Feasibility Study Increased interest in local circulators and growing interest in electric vehicle technology prompted this study of the feasibility of using electric or hybrid-electric vehicles as the technology of choice for municipal, neighborhood, and other transit circulator services in MiamiDade County. The electric vehicles are an attractive option to serve areas characterized by outdoor shopping, dining, and other pedestrian activities due to their quietness, lack of exhaust smoke and fumes, and overall non-intrusive nature. This report consists of five chapters as follows: Chapter 1: Electric Vehicles  Technology and Infrastructure  provides basic information regarding electric vehicle technology and infrastructure requirements for operation and maintenance. Chapter 2: Study Areas  provides a brief description of the eighteen study areas including either existing or potential circulator service characteristics, potential vehicle requirements, and opportunities for the general provision of electric transit circulator service. Chapter 3: Funding Sources  contains a comprehensive listing and discussion of funding sources that can potentially be used for the electric vehicle circulators. Chapter 4: Electric Vehicle Experiences  provides insight on implementing, operating, and maintaining an electric vehicle circulator system based on experiences in Santa Barbara, California; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Miami Beach. Chapter 5: Findings and Recommendations  provides concluding thoughts and recommendations regarding the feasibility of using electrically powered vehicles for transit circulator services in various areas of Miami-Dade County. G. Common Elements in Studies Our review identified a number of common themes and consistent elements in the six transit circulator studies completed for the Miami-Dade MPO. The typical recommended services were neighborhood circulators operating on local streets. The circulators were complementary to and established a link with the existing transit service provided by MDT. Several reports recommended providing stops at regional transit system hubs. The recommended routes had fixed stops, which allows residents to become familiar with the Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  8   circulator system. Headways should be ""clockface""  every location is served at the same time every hour of the day  so schedules are easy to understand. In terms of vehicle type, smaller buses are recommended for transit circulators. circulators, which seats 20-25 passengers. The term  ""minibus"" or ""shuttle"" was often used in the studies to describe the ideal vehicle for local transit The smaller buses are capable of more easily navigating through different neighborhood environments and are not perceived as a nuisance. In addition, the buses should be low floored or ""lift-equipped"" to accommodate physically challenged and elderly passengers. Electric vehicles provide an attractive option because of their overall non-intrusive nature. To assess the feasibility of providing circulator services the studies examined land use characteristics and density of the localities to be served. A high-density area with mixed uses is generally regarded as a relatively ideal environment for instituting transit service. A target population of potential riders should be identified. Typical target populations include seniors, students, and low-income workers. A funding mechanism should also be identified during the planning stage. Typical funding sources include city, county, and state governments; transit agencies; and community level funding sources. Charging a fare may help pay for some of the operating costs; however, an excessive fare may deter people from using the service.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  9   III. DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGY Transit data were collected from various communities and transit operators with existing transit circulator systems. Additional information was obtained from transit maps and Internet sites. The purpose of the data collection effort was to develop a transit circulator database including socioeconomic characteristics, geographic characteristics, operational characteristics, system characteristics, funding, and results. After compiling the transit circulator database, typical conditions for successful transit circulators were identified in subsequent stages of the study. A. Socioeconomic Characteristics Socioeconomic characteristics compiled for communities served by transit circulators include total population, age cohorts, household ownership, and household income. Total population provides an indicator of the potential market for transit circulator services. The remaining socioeconomic characteristics may be used to identify the transit dependent portion of the population. In terms of age cohorts, the percentages of the population over 65 years and under 18 years were identified. These age groups include many people that are too old or young to drive. Household ownership  measured by the percentage of rental housing within the community  and median household income are economic indicators of households for which automobile ownership may be a burden. B. Geographic Characteristics Geographic characteristics compiled for the transit circulator communities include the area-types and specific activity centers served by the transit circulators. A key factor in assessing the need for transit service is land use patterns. A mixture of residential and nonresidential land uses fosters transit usage by providing trip origins and destinations in the same area. Transit ridership typically increases with residential density. Major trip attractors that are supportive of transit service were also identified. C. Operational Characteristics Operational characteristics compiled for the communities include the number of circulator routes, service span, headways, fares, and vehicle types. Service span includes the days of the week and Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  10   hours of operation. Headway, which is a measure of service frequency, is the time between transit stops. Data was compiled on fares and fare collection methods. Vehicle types were noted including the number of seats. D. System Characteristics System characteristics describe ""how the circulator operates in the community it serves."" Some system characteristics compiled for the communities include links and the ability to transfer to the regional transit system. Other system characteristics may include delivering passengers from remote parking facilities to final destinations. E. Funding Since operating revenues usually cannot cover funding for transit circulators, funding sources were identified. Funding sources include general municipal; local sources; and county, state, and federal programs. F. Results Results compiled for the transit circulators include ridership and costs associated with providing the service. The availability of ridership data differed among the communities. For some communities there were no ridership data; daily and/or yearly ridership data were available for other communities. There were varying levels of costs data available for the communities. The costs data ranged from hourly costs for operating the service to yearly operating budgets.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  11   IV. DATA FOR EXISTING TRANSIT CIRCULATORS A number of communities in Miami-Dade County already provide transit circulator services. Besides obtaining data from these communities, data were compiled from a number of communities in Broward County, Florida. Data were also complied for three circulator systems outside South Florida to provide a perspective on types of services provided in other regions. These services include Lymmo in Orlando, Florida, and two circulator systems in suburban Chicago, Illinois. Some transit circulator data were more readily available. For example, almost every community provided the hours of operations for their transit circulator services. On the other hand, ridership data were often difficult to obtain for some smaller transit circulator services. Since many of these smaller transit circulator systems are fully subsidized and do not collect fares, these systems do not record boardings. The data are summarized in two separate tables provided in the Appendix: Table A-1 summarizes data for transit circulators in Miami-Dade County and Table A-2 summarizes the data for transit circulators outside of Miami-Dade County. A brief discussion of the services provided in each community is presented next. A. Miami-Dade County Local Transit Circulators 1. Aventura Aventura provides a circulator service that is subsidized from its general fund. The service is contracted out to Coach USA at a cost of $36 per hour. A large portion (35.2%) of Aventura's population is over 65 years old, and the transit circulator focuses on serving the needs of this population group. The circulator serves condominiums in Aventura and provides access to shopping destinations and the local hospital. A ""skip-stop service"" (each condominium complex is served on every other trip) operates on the circulator's three routes to shorten the travel time for passengers. The circulator provides a connection to regional transit  MDT and Broward County Transit (BCT)  at the Aventura Mall. No fare is charged to ride the 20-seat minibuses and approximately 250 passengers per day ride the circulator.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  12   2. Bal Harbour Bal Harbour provides a free circulator service that operates between 9:00 AM and 1:00 PM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Although the community has a relatively small population, a high percentage (37.5%) of its population is over 65 years old. The circulator serves residential areas and shopping areas with one route that operates on 60-minute headways. The route also provides a connection to Miami-Dade Transit (MDT) routes. The service is contracted to HandiVan, which provides a 15-seat minibus for $44.50 per hour. 3. Brickell MDT operates the Brickell shuttle, which was recommended in the Miami Surface Shuttle Services: Feasibility Study for Transit Circulator Services in Downtown Miami, Brickell, Overtown, and Airport West. The shuttle was implemented on April 1, 2001, and it is financed by Job Access and Reverse Commuting funds. The shuttle serves employment centers and multifamily residences in the Brickell neighborhood south of downtown Miami. The shuttle operates on 15-minute headways from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM, Monday through Saturday. MDT uses 26-seat minibuses for this service and charges its $0.25 shuttle fare. Ridership is approximately 100 passengers per day. 4. Hialeah Hialeah - one of the largest communities in Miami-Dade County with a population of 226,419  is on the verge of implementing a circulator service. The circulator will serve parks, shopping centers, government centers, and industrial parks. Two routes will operate on thirty-minute headways from 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM on weekdays and from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on weekends. The service will provide links to the regional transit system including Metrobus, Metrorail, and Tri-Rail. The City has adopted the MDT fare structure and is in negotiations with Coach USA to operate the service utilizing 24-seat Bluebird buses. 5. Miami Beach The Electrowave, a circulator service that uses electric buses, serves Miami Beach. The  Electrowave provides transportation in the South Beach area and operates from 8:00 AM to 2:00 AM on Mondays through Wednesdays, 8:00 AM to 4:00 AM on Thursdays through Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM until 2:00 AM on Sundays and holidays. Headways are approximately 10 minutes and a fare of $0.25 is charged. The late-night service provides transit options for the Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  13   many people attracted to the ""night-life"" of South Beach and links to remote parking. Several Electrowave shuttle stops are shared with MDT bus stops. The service is operated by the Miami Beach Transportation Management Association (TMA) and is funded by a host of agencies including the City, Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), Miami-Dade MPO, and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). In the three years of operation, total ridership exceeds 3.5 million passengers. The feasibility of expanding the service to other parts of the City is presently under consideration. 6. North Bay Village North Bay Village operates a circulator service to serve shopping needs of its residents. Although only 12.1 percent of North Bay Village's population is over 65 years old, the transit service is specifically targeted for senior citizens of the community and it attracts only four to six riders daily. The service provides one route at 9:00 AM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays to a grocery store. One route to the Aventura Mall is provided on Fridays at 9:00 AM. There is no charge for the grocery store route and $1.00 is charged for the Aventura Mall route. 7. North Miami Beach The North Miami Beach (NMB)-Line is a free transit circulator that serves condominiums, shopping centers, groceries, department stores, government centers, restaurants, and a library. Although the City has a relatively small percentage (11.3%) of residents over 65 years old, the majority of NMB-Line passengers are elderly. There are two routes that operate on one fixed route, one travels clockwise and one travels counterclockwise. This pattern shortens travel times to many destinations. Five clockwise buses run daily between 8:30 AM and 4:30 PM on 90minute headways and four counterclockwise fixed-routes run daily between 9:15 AM and 3:45 PM on 90-minute headways. Service is contracted out to Handi-Van, which provides 15-seat handicap-accessible E350 Vans. The NMB-Line is currently financed through the City's general fund; however, the City has previously received funding from county, state, and federal grants. 8. Sunny Isles Beach Sunny Isles Beach operates a free transit service that provides its residents access to shopping and also provides links to Metrobus. There is one fixed-stop route with two minibuses, which seat between 15 and 25 passengers. The service operates everyday except Sunday between the hours of 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM on 30-minute headways.

Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #1  Data Collection and Research June 2002  19   V. SUMMARY Recent feasibility studies for establishing local transit circulators in Miami-Dade County were reviewed and a database was compiled for local transit circulators. The database includes socioeconomic characteristics, geographic characteristics, operational characteristics, system characteristics, funding, and performance results. Data were obtained for existing Miami-Dade County circulators and for a number of circulators in Broward County, Florida. Data were also obtained for several circulators outside South Florida to provide insight on services provided in other regions. As the data was assembled, consistent elements were apparent among transit circulator systems. Many circulators cater to the needs of elderly or transit dependent populations, and primarily provide transportation for shopping trips. Other circulators serve commuters, move people around a downtown, or provide shuttle services from park-ride lots. Next, a survey was developed to obtain additional information that proved difficult to obtain such as costs and ridership for circulator systems in Miami-Dade County. The survey also gauged community interest in establishing local transit circulators and attempted to identify issues key to the implementation of these services. This transit circulator survey is presented in the following technical memorandum. The data obtained in the survey and in this collection and research effort were subsequently analyzed to identify characteristics key to the successful implementation of circulator type services. Circulator service guidelines were then established for developing and monitoring transit circulators in Miami-Dade County. This process is presented in subsequent technical memoranda.

INTRODUCTION In response to Miami-Dade County communities' interest in establishing or helping to fund local transit circulators and the lack of procedures for assessing the feasibility and planning for these services, the Miami-Dade Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) initiated the Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study. The two main objectives of this study were (1) to develop a set of guidelines and standards for establishing local transit circulator services and (2) to develop measures of effectiveness (MOEs) for evaluating these services. This technical memorandum represents the second in a series of reports documenting the work and findings of this study. The previous technical memorandum summarized ""Data Collection and Research."" This technical memorandum summarizes the design, execution, and results of a survey of municipal staff that was conducted for this study. The data obtained in the ""Transit Circulator Survey"" helped identify communities that are interested in establishing transit circulators and was also used to develop procedures for establishing circulator service. Two subsequent technical memoranda were prepared for additional tasks as they were completed throughout the study. These technical memoranda appear as subsequent chapters of this report.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #2  Survey June 2002  1   II. SURVEY DESIGN Several aspects of survey design were considered during the development of the survey for the Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study. The survey's goals and objectives; target audience; the format of the survey questionnaire; and how to administer the survey were important factors of consideration. The goal of the survey design was to provide communities with an opportunity to provide input and at the same time present a survey design that minimized efforts required to respond to the ""Transit Circulator Survey."" An overview of the survey design process is presented below. A. Objectives The objectives of the ""Transit Circulator Survey"" were twofold. The first objective was to identify communities that are interested in either establishing or expanding transit circulator services. The second objective was to obtain data on existing transit circulators that may be used to develop procedures for establishing circulator services. In particular, survey provided a means for obtaining additional information that was difficult to obtain during the ""Data Collection and Research"" effort, such as ridership and costs for existing circulator systems in Miami-Dade County. B. Target Audience An initial step in the development of the ""Transit Circulator Survey"" was the identification of the target audience. In order to provide Miami-Dade communities an opportunity to participate in this study and provide input, all incorporated areas in the County were targeted for the survey with the exception of Indian Creek Village and Islandia. These two communities were not targeted for the survey because their small population bases (less than 100 persons) and geography (island communities) preclude the feasible provision of fixed-route circulator services by the municipality. All other municipalities in Miami-Dade County were surveyed. In addition, the survey was distributed to five communities in Broward County and one suburb of Chicago, Illinois (Downer's Grove). These communities were targeted for the survey to obtain perspectives outside Miami-Dade County and to obtain additional information on their existing  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #2  Survey June 2002  2   transit circulators beyond the data that was acquired during the ""Data Collection and Research"" effort. A list of the targeted communities is provided in Table 2-1. A total of 35 communities were requested to participate. Table 2 - 1: List of Communities Targeted for ""Transit Circulator Survey""  Miami-Dade County Communities: City of Aventura Village of Bal Harbour Town of Bay Harbor Islands Village of Biscayne Park City of Coral Gables Village of El Portal City of Florida City Town of Golden Beach City of Hialeah City of Hialeah Gardens City of Homestead Village of Key Biscayne Town of Medley City of Miami City of Miami Beach Town of Miami Lakes Village of Miami Shores City of Miami Springs City of North Bay Village City of North Miami City of North Miami Beach City of Opa-Locka Village of Pinecrest City of South Miami City of Sunny Isles Beach Town of Surfside City of Sweetwater Village of Virginia Gardens City of West Miami  Broward County Communities: City of Fort Lauderdale City of Margate City of Miramar City of Plantation City of Sunrise Communities Outside South Florida: Village of Downer's Grove, Illinois  Based upon input from the Study Advisory Committee, a decision was made to target municipal staff in lieu of political representatives. The basis for this decision was that municipal staff would be more knowledgeable of the administration and operation of transit circulators. Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #2  Survey June 2002  3   City managers were targeted for the survey in communities without existing circulator services. In communities with existing circulator services, staff had previously been contacted during the study's ""Data Collection and Research."" These contacts were maintained as the appropriate targets for the survey. C. Format A draft survey instrument was initially prepared and submitted to the Study Advisory Committee for review and comment. The draft survey instrument contained many open-ended questions that the Study Advisory Committee believed would be difficult to answer. Therefore, the Study Advisory Committee recommended modifying  wherever possible  open-ended questions to multiple choice or true/false questions. The Study Advisory Committee also recommended grouping the questions into two sections. Questions in the first section sought to identify the need for circulator services, while questions in the second section aimed to collect data on existing circulator services. All communities were asked to complete the first section of the survey, ""Identification of Need for Service,"" while only communities that already have transit circulators were directed to answer the ""Existing Circulator Service"" section. The survey was originally envisioned to be administered via e-mail, but it was determined that several contacts in the various communities do not have access to e-mail. However, fax numbers were identified for all the communities during the preparation of a contact list. Administering the survey via fax offered two key advantages over sending the survey through the regular postal service: (1) the surveys could be received rapidly (same-day); and (2) the ease of survey return via fax without the need of addressing an envelope and supplying postage. An introduction to the study was included at the beginning of the survey instrument. The introduction included a definition of transit circulators, the objectives of the study, and the purpose of the survey. Also included in the introduction was an invitation to attend the October 10, 2001, Study Advisory Committee meeting to learn about the findings of the survey and provide further input. A copy of the survey instrument is provided in the Appendix.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #2  Survey June 2002  4   III. SURVEY EXECUTION The ""Transit Circulator Survey"" was faxed to the 35 communities listed in Table 2-1 on August 31, 2001. In the survey's introduction a deadline of September 14, 2001, was stipulated for the communities to respond; the deadline allowed the communities two full weeks to complete and return the survey. This timeframe was necessary to allow the study to proceed to its next task, ""Data Analysis,"" on schedule. Ten surveys were returned by the end of the first week after its distribution. Reminder phone calls were made to the communities that had not returned the surveys early in the second week after its distribution. These communities were encouraged to participate in the study by responding to the survey. Eight additional surveys were returned in advance of the deadline and four additional surveys were received after the deadline after further solicitation. Altogether 22 communities responded to the survey, which represents a 63 percent response rate. Although more than half the communities responded to the survey, two events occurred during the second week after the survey's distribution that may have impacted the return from being even higher. These events included (1) the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, which resulted in the closing of many public buildings, and (2) heavy rain in South Florida along with the threat of Tropical Storm Gabrielle from September 12 through September 14, 2001.  A list of the communities that responded to the survey is provided in Table 2-2.

SURVEY RESULTS This section presents the data collected in the ""Transit Circulator Survey."" Of the 22  communities that responded to the survey, seventeen were located in Miami-Dade County, four were located in Broward County, and one was located in suburban Chicago, Illinois. Ten of these communities have existing circulator services, including six of the Miami-Dade communities. The majority of the respondents answered most of the questions that were applicable for their communities. Questions A1 through B1 were applicable for communities without existing circulator services and Questions A1 through B11 were applicable for communities with existing circulator services. However, several questions received a low response rate. In particular, many respondents did not answer Question A6 (automobile ownership per household), which suggests that this data was not readily available. A. Database The data received in the surveys were entered into a Microsoft Access database. An input form was created that provided separate fields for the possible responses to the survey questions; the input form is included in the Appendix. The database was an effective tool for summarizing the responses to the survey questions, and the database provides capability to create tables and graphs for further data analysis. B. Responses The intent of questions A1 through A10 was to identify the need for circulator services, while the intent of questions B1 through B11 was to obtain data on existing circulator services, especially data that was difficult to obtain during this study's ""Data Collection and Research"" task. The data on existing circulator services will be used to develop standards and procedures for establishing circulator services in Miami-Dade County. As mentioned previously, the survey was administered to municipal staff. Some of the responses to the survey questions represent the opinions and/or perceptions of the staff member that responded. The responses to the survey questions are summarized in the following sections.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #2  Survey June 2002  7   1. Identification of Need for Service Eleven of the surveyed communities indicated that requests have been made for new circulator service or the expansion of existing service, which represents 64 percent of the communities that responded to the survey.

Nine of the communities that responded to the survey already have circulator service. Two more communities are on the verge of establishing circulator service, one community has had a feasibility study for circulator service, and four additional communities have discussed the possibility of implementing circulator service. Only three of the communities either have not discussed the possibility of circulator service or believe providing circulator service is the County's responsibility.

Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #2  Survey June 2002  8   Potential budget constraints were cited most frequently by municipal staff as a concern of the municipality operating its own circulator service. The next most frequently cited concerns were municipal staff's lack of familiarity with operating transit service and the belief that circulator service should be contracted out to a private service provider. Only 32 percent of the municipal staff that responded to the survey believe their community is served at least adequately by existing transit routes, while 54 percent of the respondents believe their community is served less than adequate or not at all by existing transit routes.

Additionally, the data received from some respondents does not appear accurate. For instance, one respondent indicated that 100 percent of the households in their community own two or more automobiles. Population density was between 3,000 and 7,500 persons per square mile in 45 percent of the communities that 30% 0 to 3,000 persons per square mile 3,000 to 7,500 persons per square mile Greater than 7,500 persons per square mile 25%  Population Density  provided this data. In 30 percent of the communities, the population density was less than 3,000 persons per square mile; in 25 percent of the communities; the population density was greater than 7,500 persons per square mile.  45%  According to the staff of the communities that responded to the survey, transit circulator service would be most heavily used during the AM rush hour, mid-day (lunch-hour), and the PM rush hour. There would be less demand during the morning and afternoon off-peaks, and the least demand would be during nights and on weekends.

Existing Circulator Service Data Responses to Question B1 identified communities that already have community transit circulators or shuttle services. As mentioned previously, 10 of the 22 communities that responded to the survey presently provide circulator services for their residents. The communities that do not have existing circulator services were instructed not to proceed with the survey beyond Question B1. Questions B2 through B11 sought to obtain data on the existing circulator services; responses to these questions are summarized below. Studies or surveys to assess rider satisfaction have been performed in four of the communities with existing circulator services. However, only one of these communities is located within Miami-Dade County. Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #2  Survey June 2002  11   According to the staff of the communities that responded to the survey, reactions to transit circulator services have been overwhelmingly positive within the communities. Community Reaction to Existing Circulator Services Positive Negative Indifferent # of Responses 8 0 1 % of Responses 89% 0% 11%  Total costs associated with providing circulator services varied widely across the communities. Primary factors that influence these costs include the number of routes, service span, and headway(s). Administrative costs are generally higher for communities with larger systems that provide coordination internally and are generally lower for communities that contract their service to a private transportation provider. Few communities allocate funds for marketing their circulator service, and communities that do allocate funds for marketing assign only a small budget in comparison to other costs. Private transportation providers are contracted to operate the circulator service in four of communities that responded to the survey. The hourly rates are $36 per route in the two communities that provided cost information. Schedules are available for riders in eight of the communities, maps are available in seven of the communities, and four of the communities have brochures for their circulators. The circulator route information is most often (70 percent of the time) available at city hall. Four of the ten communities provide circulator route information on their websites.

None of the communities market their circulator services on television or the radio, which most likely is related to the costs associated with this more expensive form of media. According to the perceptions of municipal staff that responded to the survey, ridership is increasing in five of the nine communities that provided a description of recent trends, while ridership is stable in three communities and is only decreasing in one community. Increasing Stable Decreasing  Recent Ridership Trend 11.11%  33.33%  55.56%  Five of the ten communities with existing circulators that responded to the survey fund their circulator services entirely locally from a combination of fare box revenue and internal funding sources. A variety of sources assist the other five communities in funding their circulator services including county funds, state funds, federal funds, on-board advertising revenues, bus bench and shelter advertising revenues, parking revenues, and concurrency mitigation funds. Communities with existing circulator services were requested to provide route information including headway, span of service, route length, fares, ridership, and route description. The purpose of obtaining this information was to identify characteristics of existing transit circulator systems. These data were then analyzed to determine common traits of successful transit circulator systems in the next study task, ""Data Analysis.""

SUMMARY This technical memorandum described the development and execution of the ""Transit Circulator Survey."" This survey was developed to identify communities in Miami-Dade County that are interested in establishing or expanding transit circulator services. Additionally, the survey was developed and administered to obtain data on existing transit circulators that was difficult to obtain during this study's ""Data Collection and Research"" task. The survey was returned by 22 (63 percent) of the 35 communities that it was distributed to, including ten communities with existing transit circulators. The survey also found that several more communities either are in the process of establishing circulators or are at least interested in establishing circulators. Various information was gathered on the transit circulator systems of the ten communities with existing circulators that responded to the survey. overwhelmingly positive in these communities. The information obtained in the survey was reviewed and analyzed in subsequent stages of the study, along with information that was acquired during the ""Data Collection and Research"" task. In particular, this information gathered in these two efforts was evaluated to identify common conditions and service attributes that characterize successful transit circulator systems. A list of development guidelines and standards for local transit circulator services were eventually result from these analyses. The reaction to the circulators has been  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #2  Survey June 2002  14   APPENDIX   Miami-Dade Metropolitan Planning Organization  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Background Recently, a number of communities in Miami-Dade County have expressed interest in establishing local transit circulator ser vices to improve community mobility and provide connections to the regional transit system. These types of circulators ser ve local trips within a community and neighborhoods not typically ser ved by the regional transit system. In response to the interest in establishing these local transit circulators, the Miami-Dade MPO contracted Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. to conduct the ""Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study."" The two primar y objectives of this study are (1) to develop a set of guidelines and standards for establishing local transit circulator ser vices; and (2) to develop measures of effectiveness (MOEs) for evaluating these ser vices. This sur vey is a key part of this study. The sur vey will help identify communities that are interested in either establishing or expanding transit circulator ser vices. A second purpose of the sur vey is to obtain data on existing transit circulators that will be used to develop procedures for establishing circulator ser vices.

INTRODUCTION In response to Miami-Dade County communities' interest in establishing or helping to fund local transit circulators and the lack of procedures for assessing the feasibility and planning for these services, the Miami-Dade Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) initiated the Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study. This technical memorandum is the third in a series of reports documenting the work and findings of this study. The first technical memorandum summarized ""Data Collection and Research"" and the second technical memorandum presented the ""Transit Circulator Survey."" This technical memorandum discusses the findings of the ""Data Analysis"" portion of this study. Data collected during both the ""Data Collection and Research"" and the ""Transit Circulator Survey"" was analyzed to identify common practices and operating environments, which may indicate conditions and service characteristics that may be required for establishing successful circulator services. One additional technical memorandum was prepared for the final study task, ""Development Guidelines and Standards for Local Transit Circulator Services."" This technical memorandum appears as subsequent chapter of this report.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002  1   II. DATA ANALYSIS A wealth of information was compiled in a transit circulator database during the ""Data Collection and Research"" portion of this study. This database includes socioeconomic characteristics, geographic characteristics, operational characteristics, system characteristics, funding sources, costs, and ridership information. Additional data obtained in the ""Transit Circulator Survey"" includes the identification of need for community circulator service and system information on existing community circulator systems. A. Data Collection and Research Database This subsection highlights important descriptive statistics and observations from the database compiled during the ""Data Collection and Research"" portion of this study, which was completed prior to the administering of the ""Transit Circulator Survey."" The transit circulator database includes information on nine Miami-Dade municipalities, eleven Broward County, Florida, municipalities, and three municipalities outside of South Florida. All these municipalities have existing circulator services. The database is presented in two separate tables provided in the Appendix: Table A-1 summarizes data for transit circulators in Miami-Dade County and Table A-2 summarizes the data for transit circulators outside of Miami-Dade County. Note, the Miami circulator service, the ""Brickell Circulator,"" is actually operated by Miami-Dade Transit - not the City of Miami. Also, Hialeah was included in the transit circulator database, although its circulator service is still just on the verge of implementation. The population of the nine Miami-Dade County municipalities in the database ranges from 3,305 persons (Bal Harbour) to 362,470 persons (Miami). Populations are based on the 2000 U.S. Census. The mean population of these municipalities is 85,904 persons; however, the median population is only 25,267 persons. The large populations of Miami and Hialeah skew the mean, so the median population may be considered more typical of municipalities providing circulator service. The population of Miami-Dade municipalities that have existing circulator service is generally smaller than the population of municipalities outside of Miami-Dade County that are in the study Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002  2   database. The median population of these municipalities in Broward County is 72,739 persons, which is nearly three times the median population of the Miami-Dade municipalities. The median population of the municipalities outside of South Florida is 148,110 persons. Based on a review of the database, a minimum service area population base of approximately 30,000 persons may be necessary to support full-scale community circulator services. Although circulator service may be provided for service areas with a smaller population base, the type of service provided in these communities is generally limited service geared toward a specific segment of the population, such as shuttle services serving shopping trips of the elderly. The elderly population can provide a significant ridership base for community circulators. In particular, a large elderly population may indicate a high level of transit dependency, since a significant portion of the elderly population does not own vehicles. For this study, the elderly were defined as persons aged 65 or older. Of Miami-Dade County municipalities in the study database, the portion of the elderly citizens is 23.8 percent. In Broward County, this age cohort represents only 17.1 percent of the population for municipalities in the study database. Although a specific threshold is difficult to define for the percentage of the population that is elderly, a larger elderly population may be a general indicator of the need for circulator service. Higher population densities provide more favorable conditions for transit. Population densities in the study database are higher for the Miami-Dade County municipalities than the Broward County municipalities and the municipalities outside of South Florida. Dade municipalities in the study database is smaller. However, the total population base must also be taken into consideration and the population of many of the MiamiAdditionally, many Broward County municipalities operate successful circulators despite lower population densities. Based upon a review of the database, a minimum population density of approximately 3,000 persons per square mile may be necessary to support full-scale community circulator services. Fixed route circulator service in less densely populated communities may have difficulty attracting significant ridership. The percentage of rental housing in a community may be another indicator of transit dependency. Typically, high levels of rental housing are associated with lower incomes and transit dependency. Although the percentage of rental housing is high for a number of the Miami-Dade municipalities in the database, the median household income is relatively high in these communities. The percentage of rental housing is not related to low incomes in these 3  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002   communities, but is more closely related to the large number of retirees and seasonal residents. Additionally, a number of these retirees have migrated from urban environments with extensive transit systems and desire the level of mobility to which they are accustomed. However, a specific threshold for the percentage of rental housing is difficult to extract from the study database. B. Transit Circulator Survey This subsection highlights important descriptive statistics and observations from the information collected in the ""Transit Circulator Survey."" The survey was divided into two sections: ""Identification of Need for Service"" and ""Existing Circulator Services."" Municipalities that currently do not have circulator service only responded to the first part of the survey, ""Identification of Need for Service."" Municipalities with existing circulator service responded to both parts of the survey. A total of 22 surveys were returned, twelve by municipalities without existing circulator services and ten by municipalities that presently operate transit circulators. 1. Identification of Need for Service In the ""Identification of Need for Service"" section of the survey, five of the eight communities with existing circulator service that responded to the survey indicated that their median household income is greater than $30,000, which was the highest median income value provided as a survey response. The provision of circulator services in these communities is counterintuitive, because typically low-income segments of the population are associated with transit dependency and the need for transit service. These findings may indicate that the provision of circulator service is more closely related to a municipality's wealth. Circulator service is more widespread in higherincome municipalities, because these municipalities have sufficient funds to subsidize the service. The survey also sought information on automobile ownership per household. Low levels of automobile ownership are often an indicator of transit dependency. However, only a few of the returned surveys provided accurate data on automobile ownership and no specific thresholds could be drawn from the data. All eight municipalities with existing circulator service that responded to the survey question regarding population density have population densities greater than 3,000 persons per square Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002  4   mile. These results support the earlier findings from the ""Data Collection and Research"" portion of this study that a population density of 3,000 persons per square mile may be necessary to support full-scale community circulator services. The survey also provided information that five of the twelve municipalities without circulator services have population densities less than 3,000 persons per square mile. These results may indicate that these municipalities may have difficulty attracting significant ridership if they establish circulator services. 2. Existing Circulator Services Ten surveys were returned by municipalities with existing circulator services; however, one of these surveys contained responses to only three of the survey questions. Therefore, extensive information was obtained on the existing circulator service in nine municipalities. Information was obtained on the costs associated with operating circulator service to provide insight on the scale of investment for municipalities considering establishing these services. This represents particularly useful information, because several municipalities indicated municipal budget constraints are a concern for their municipality potentially operating and/or funding its own circulator. According to the survey responses, annual operating costs for municipal circulators range from $16,000 (North Bay Village) to over $2,000,000 (Miami Beach). Excluding the operating costs of these two municipalities, whose level of service and costs are outliers in comparison to the other municipalities, the average annual operating costs for circulator service are approximately $354,000. Three of the municipalities (Aventura, Bay Harbor Islands, and Fort Lauderdale) contract their circulator service to a private transportation provider. Average hourly costs in these municipalities are approximately $36 per route. Additionally, the survey found average annual administrative costs for circulator service are approximately $85,000 per year. Also, three of the municipalities (Downer's Grove, Fort Lauderdale, and Miami Beach) allocate funds for marketing. Average marketing costs in these communities are approximately $20,000. The level of transit service may have a major impact on the transit circulators' success in attracting ridership. In terms of service characteristics, the average headway for the circulator Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002  5   routes in the communities that responded to the survey was approximately one hour. Another important service characteristic is the hours of operation, which influences the type of trips the circulator service can accommodate. Most of the circulators have limited hours of operation that do not extend into the evening. Therefore, these circulators may not be capable of serving many commute trips. 3. Comparison of Results for Communities with/without Circulator Service Survey results were compared for communities with and without existing circulator service to determine if any meaningful similarities and/or differences exist between these communities. The findings are presented below in Table 3-1.  Table 3 - 1: Analysis of Municipalities with/without Circulator Service Percentage with Annual Median Household Income > $30,000 Existing Municipal Circulator Service No Existing Municipal Circulator Service 62.5% 54.5% Percentage with Population Density > 3,000 (persons per square mile) 100.0% 58.3%  Percentage of Households with less than 2 Automobiles* 77.5% 48.3%  * This data should be interpreted with caution due to small sample size.  The analysis found that annual median household income is generally higher in the municipalities with circulator services. As previously mentioned, this finding may demonstrate that wealthier municipalities more often have funds available to subsidize the service. Although only a limited amount of data was complied on automobile ownership, this data indicates that circulator service is more widespread in municipalities with lower levels of automobile ownership. This data indicates that transit service may be more vital for communities with lower levels of automobile ownership, which may indicate greater levels of transit dependency. Population density is generally higher in municipalities with existing circulator service. This finding supports earlier findings that population density is positively correlated to the demand for transit services.

TYPES OF TRANSIT CIRCULATOR SERVICES As the data on existing transit circulators was compiled and reviewed, four unique types of circulator routes were identified that exhibit unique service and operational characteristics. These four types of transit circulator routes are downtown circulators, neighborhood circulators, parkride and feeder circulators, and shopping-based/""life-line"" circulators. The type of transit circulator route is dictated by a community's transit needs, which are specified by the community's socioeconomic and geographical characteristics. Downtown circulator routes are often offered in high employment areas. Neighborhood circulators are often located in suburban municipalities with lower population densities. Park-ride and feeder circulator routes serve peak period commuter needs. Shopping-based/""life-line"" circulators typically operate in municipalities that have high proportions of elderly citizens. A. Downtown Circulator Routes Downtown circulators serve trips within a community's central business district (CBD). These trips are not usually home-based trips, but are more typically trips from remote parking lots, trips within the CBD during the business day, or trips serving nighttime recreational activities. Downtown circulators serve high-density areas that are often large employment centers. Examples of downtown circulators examined in this study include the ""Electrowave"" in Miami Beach, the ""TMAX Downtown-Courthouse Loop"" in Fort Lauderdale, and the ""Lymmo"" in Orlando. B. Neighborhood Circulator Routes Neighborhood circulators typically operate in suburban communities of at least 30,000 persons. These services often utilize local streets instead of major arterials and serve neighborhoods not served by the regional transit system. Neighborhood circulators sometimes share stops with the regional transit system, thus providing a connection to the regional transit system. Neighborhood circulators may serve diverse trip purposes including commuting, shopping, and recreation. Examples of neighborhood circulator routes examined in this study include Miami's Brickell Shuttle, the ""TMAX Northwest Circulator"" in Fort Lauderdale, and the Margate ""Inner-City Transit"" routes. Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002  7   C. Park-Ride and Feeder Circulator Routes Park-ride and feeder circulator routes typically provide a connection to a final destination or a link between different modes of travel. These routes may operate between a park-ride lot and a downtown employment center or may function as a feeder service for other transportation modes, such as commuter rail. Although not always the case, these services often operate only during the peak hours. Fares for park-ride and feeder routes are sometimes higher than fares charged for downtown or neighborhood circulators. This may result from the focus of this service, which is to serve one specific function. Examples of the park-ride and feeder circulator routes examined in this study include the ""TMAX Park-Ride Bus"" in Fort Lauderdale, ""Tri-Rail Feeder"" bus routes, and the service in Downers Grove, Illinois, which operates between residential neighborhoods and a commuter rail station. D. Shopping-Based/""Lifeline"" Circulators Shopping-based/""lifeline"" circulators tend to operate in areas with elderly populations that depend on transit for basic transportation services for purposes like shopping and medical trips. These circulators often stop at condominium complexes inhabited by senior citizens and at senior community centers. The routes often connect to popular shopping destinations such as malls and also to essential shopping destinations such as grocery stores or post offices. These circulator routes are common in small densely populated municipalities with large proportions of senior citizens. Examples of shopping-based/lifeline circulator routes examined in this study include the North Bay Village and Bay Harbor Islands circulator routes. E. Comparison of Circulator Route Types Downtown circulator routes and park-ride and feeder circulator routes are identifiable by operational characteristics, such as headways and route structure. Distinguishing between neighborhood circulators and shopping-based/""lifeline"" circulators is not always as clear. However, neighborhood circulator routes typically operate in larger suburban communities with populations greater than 30,000 persons. On the other hand, shopping-based/""lifeline"" circulator routes typically operate in smaller communities with larger proportions of elderly citizens.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002  8   Table 3-2 presents information collected in the ""Data Collection and Research"" and ""Transit Circulator Survey"" for the different types of circulator routes. Several municipalities contribute to more than one route category, because these municipalities have multiple circulator routes that exhibit different characteristics.  Table 3 - 2: Average Service Characteristics by Circulator Route Types Daily Span of Service (hours) Downtown Circulators Neighborhood Circulators Park-Ride and Feeder Circulators Shopping-Based/ ""Lifeline"" Circulators 14 9 7 7 Headway (minutes) 16 53 50 68 Route Length (miles) 4 10 10 Not Available Daily Ridership 1,005 112 156 44 Ridership per Revenue Hour 25 15 29 6  As shown in Table 3-2, downtown circulator routes tend to operate for longer hours than the other types of circulator routes. Downtown circulator routes also offer more frequent service (shorter headways) than the other types of circulator routes, and their route lengths are usually much shorter. Daily ridership is highest for the downtown circulator routes, although ridership per revenue hour is similar for park-ride and feeder circulator routes. The hours of operation are typically shorter for neighborhood circulator routes than for downtown circulator routes. However, the hours of operation for many neighborhood circulator routes are long enough to serve commuters in both the AM and PM peak periods. Neighborhood circulator routes typically have longer route lengths than downtown circulator routes. Headways tend to be longer for neighborhood circulator routes than for downtown circulator routes, but neighborhood circulator routes often provide shorter headways than shopping-based/""lifeline"" circulator routes. Ridership is much lower for neighborhood circulator routes than for downtown circulator routes, but ridership on neighborhood circulator routes typically exceeds ridership on shoppingbased/""lifeline"" circulator routes. The hours of operation are typically more limited for park-ride and feeder circulator routes than for downtown and neighborhood circulator routes. Headways are typically less frequent for parkLocal Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002  9   ride and feeder circulator routes than for downtown circulator routes; however, park-ride and feeder circulator routes usually offer shorter headways than neighborhood and shoppingbased/""lifeline"" circulator routes. Park-ride and feeder circulator routes are typically the most efficient of the circulator routes measured in terms of passengers per revenue hour. Ridership per revenue hour is typically even higher on park-ride and feeder circulator routes than on downtown circulator routes. Shopping-based/""lifeline"" circulator routes typically offer the shortest hours of operation and least frequent service (longest headways) of the circulator route types. In fact, shoppingbased/""lifeline"" circulator routes sometimes operate just once per day. Shopping-based/""lifeline"" circulator routes tend to have lower ridership than the other types of circulator routes. However, these circulator routes often perform a vital function in many communities by serving transit dependent segments of the population.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002  10   IV. CHARACTERISTICS OF SUCCESSFUL TRANSIT CIRCULATORS As mentioned previously, some municipalities may view circulator services as serving an essential transportation function by providing mobility for the transit dependent. Statistics such as ridership and cost recovery are not vital to the goals these communities set for their circulator service. Nevertheless, some circulator systems achieve very successful results in terms of ridership. This section identifies common traits for communities that have attracted significant ridership on their circulator systems. Based on the findings of the ""Data Collection and Research"" and the responses to the ""Transit Circulator Survey,"" Miami Beach; Fort Lauderdale; Margate; Sunrise; and Downers Grove, Illinois; were identified as relatively successful in attracting ridership for their circulator services. These municipalities represent a diverse cross-section of communities in terms of both population size and population density. Diversity also exists in the types of circulator services offered by these municipalities. Fort Lauderdale has a dense central business district that is surrounded by residential neighborhoods. In order to serve the diverse transportation needs of its community, the Downtown Fort Lauderdale Transportation Management Association (DFLTMA) operates several types of circulator routes including a downtown circulator, neighborhood circulators, and a park-ride circulator route. Margate is a relatively large suburban Broward County municipality in terms of land area and population. The City provides four neighborhood circulator routes for its citizens. These routes provide access to numerous destinations within the community and also provide connections to regional transit services. A. Service Attributes and Population Table 3-3 summarizes service attributes and socioeconomic characteristics for the circulator systems in the study database that are the most successful in attracting ridership. In particular, Table 3-3 identifies the type of circulator service, ridership data, population, and population density.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002  11   Table 3 - 3: Service Attributes and Population for Successful Transit Circulator Systems  Route Type Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale Margate Sunrise Downers Grove Downtown Circulator Various Route Types Neighborhood Circulator Neighborhood Circulator Park-Ride/Feeder Route  Average Passengers/ Revenue Hour 25 23 12 8 32  Population 87,933 152,397 53,909 85,779 148,110  Population Density (per square mile) > 7,500 > 7,500 3,000 - 7,500 3,000 - 7,500 3,000 - 7,500  All the route types identified in this study are represented in Table 3-3 with the exception of the shopping-based/lifeline circulators. Both Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale operate downtown circulator routes. Fort Lauderdale, Margate, and Sunrise offer neighborhood circulator routes, and Fort Lauderdale and Downer's Grove operate park-ride and feeder circulator routes. In terms of ridership, the Downer's Grove feeder routes attract the most passengers per revenue hour. Downer's Grove success is attributable to the focus of its service, as its routes operate for a shorter span (AM and PM peak commute periods) and serve a specific function (feeder service to commuter rail line). The downtown circulators operated in Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale attract similar ridership. The neighborhood circulator routes achieve lower ridership results per revenue hour when compared to the other route types, because these routes serve less densely populated communities. All of the municipalities included in Table 3-3 have populations greater than 50,000 persons and population densities greater than 3,000 persons per square mile. This supports earlier findings that a minimum population base for the service area and population density are necessary to attract significant ridership.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002  12   B. Costs and Funding Sources Key factors to consider before establishing municipal circulator service are the associated costs and potential funding sources. The successful transit circulator systems were examined to obtain information on the scale of investment required to provide the type of circulator service that is likely to attract significant ridership. Several of the successful circulator systems have been successful in obtaining funding from several sources. Table 3-4 presents total annual costs associated with the successful transit circulator systems and also lists the funding sources for these systems.  Table 3 - 4: Costs and Funding Sources for Successful Transit Circulator Systems  Number of Routes Total Annual Costs Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale Margate Sunrise Downers Grove 2 7 4 6 3 $2,160,000 $650,000 $406,700 $310,000 $500,000  Funding Sources City, FDOT, CMAQ, Advertising, Fares City, County, FDOT, DDA, Tri-Rail City, County, Advertising, Fares City, Fares Village, Charter Revenues, Grant, Fares  As shown in Table 3-4, Miami Beach's ""Electrowave"" circulator service is the most costly circulator service. However, the ""Electrowave"" provides the highest level of service with short headways (10 minutes) and broad hours of operation extending from 8:00 AM to 2:00 AM on weekdays and from 8:00 AM to 4:00 AM on weekends. The ""Electrowave"" is funded through several sources including City of Miami Beach parking earnings, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) funds, fare box revenue, and on-board advertising revenue. The Fort Lauderdale circulator routes are partially funded by the Broward County Transit (BCT) Community Bus Program. This program provides $20,000 annually per route with a requirement that the route operates a minimum of 40 hours per week. The DFLTMA also secures funds from Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002  13   FDOT, the Fort Lauderdale Downtown Development Authority (DDA), and the Tri-County Commuter Rail Authority (Tri-Rail). The Fort Lauderdale routes are the only routes included in Table 3-4 for which no fare is charged, although staff is considering implementing a fare in the future. The City of Margate also receives funding through its participation in the BCT Community Bus Program. Other sources of funding include City general funds, advertising, and fare box revenue. Margate recovers approximately 10 percent of the cost for the ""Margate Inner-City Transit"" service through the collection of fares. The City of Sunrise does not participate in the BCT Community Bus Program. The City's circulator routes generally operate from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM on weekdays, which does not satisfy the program's weekly minimum service requirement of 40 hours per route. Sunrise funds its circulator system entirely from its general fund and fare box revenue. Sunrise recovers approximately 9 percent of its operating costs through the collection of fares. All the successful circulator systems with the exception of Sunrise receive funding from external sources. This finding is significant because it demonstrates that municipalities usually must secure outside sources of funds in order to offset the costs associated with providing the type of circulator service that will attract significant ridership.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002  14   V. SUMMARY This technical memorandum described the results of the ""Data Analysis"" portion of this study. Data that was collected during the ""Data Collection and Research"" and the ""Transit Circulator Survey"" were analyzed to identify common traits of successful transit circulator systems. The purpose of the analysis was to determine conditions and service characteristics that may be necessary for establishing circulator service. Analysis of the database compiled during the ""Data Collection and Research"" portion of this study resulted in several significant findings. In particular, a population base for the service area of approximately 30,000 persons, along with a minimum population density of approximately 3,000 persons per square mile, may be necessary to support full-scale community circulator services. Although circulator service may be provided in communities that do not satisfy these criteria, the service may have difficulty attracting ridership. However, the circulator service in the communities that do not satisfy these criteria may be viewed as an essential transportation function that provides mobility to the transit dependent. A review of the information obtained in the ""Transit Circulator Survey"" supported the findings of the analysis of the ""Data Collection and Research"" database in terms of population base and density requirements. Also noteworthy, was the finding that circulator service is most often provided in wealthier communities. Circulator service may be more widespread in these communities, because these communities can afford to subsidize the service. Four unique types of circulator routes were identified that exhibit unique service and operational characteristics. circulators. Based upon the findings of the ""Data Collection and Research"" and the responses to the ""Transit Circulator Survey,"" Miami Beach; Fort Lauderdale; Margate; Sunrise; and Downers Grove, Illinois; were identified as relatively successful in attracting ridership for their circulator services. All of these municipalities have populations greater than 50,000 persons and population densities greater than 3,000 persons per square mile, which supports the minimum service area population base and density findings. With the exception of Sunrise all of these municipalities receive Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #3  Data Analysis June 2002  These four types of transit circulator routes are downtown circulators,  neighborhood circulators, park-ride and feeder circulators, and shopping-based/""lifeline""  15   funding from external sources.  This finding is significant because it demonstrates that  municipalities usually must secure outside sources of funds in order to offset the costs associated with providing the type of circulator service that will attract significant ridership. The next step in this study was to build upon the findings of the ""Data Analysis"" to develop a set of general guidelines and procedures for establishing local transit circulator services. The guidelines included recommendations in terms of the physical environment and service characteristics. The guidelines also addressed such issues as costs and funding sources. Finally, a process and schedule was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of transit circulator routes. This information is presented in the subsequent technical memorandum.

INTRODUCTION In response to a recent surge of interest by Miami-Dade County communities in establishing and funding local transit circulators, the Miami-Dade Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) initiated the Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study. This technical memorandum is the fourth in a series of reports documenting the work and findings of the study. The technical memoranda are summarized below. (1) (2) (3) (4) The first technical memorandum summarized a review of past studies and the development of a transit circulator information database. The second technical memorandum presented the design, execution, and results of a transit circulator survey. The third technical memorandum summarized an analysis of the transit circulator database and survey results. This final technical memorandum discusses the approaches to standardizing initiation of state- and county-facilitated municipal transit circulator services and recommends a process for monitoring the circulator services after implementation. Data collected during the study were analyzed to identify conditions and service characteristics that are common traits of successful transit circulator systems. The data were further evaluated to determine what conditions and service characteristics may be necessary for implementing a transit circulator service. Additional policy and legal issues were considered including municipal and county policy, legal issues, and potential impacts of circulator service.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  1   II. POLICY CONSIDERATIONS AND LEGAL ISSUES General policy and legal issues associated with the implementation of municipal transit circulator services are presented in this section. The objective of this section is to provide guidelines on a number of factors that must be addressed when establishing circulator services. These guidelines are broad in nature and apply to all potential municipal circulator services, regardless of the type of service being considered or location. Factors considered include: Role of municipal circulator services Interlocal agreement Risk management Federal/state regulations Section 13(c) labor protection Americans with Disabilities Act Countywide policies should be established addressing these factors as they apply to transit circulator services. A. Role of Municipal Circulator Services The Miami-Dade County Code of Ordinances grants the County jurisdiction over virtually all transportation services within its boundaries. The County operates Miami-Dade Transit (MDT), which is the sixteenth largest public transit agency in the United States. MDT provides mobility and accessibility on a countywide basis. Because of limitations, providing transit service for shorter trips within individual municipalities is not always possible. The roles of MDT and municipalities relating to transit service must be established to improve operational efficiency and the ability to move people in Miami-Dade County. Municipal transit routes should ideally serve mainly local trips by providing access to popular destinations either within the borders or within a short distance of the municipality. Municipal circulator routes would most efficiently serve local neighborhoods that have no or only partial access to MDT routes. MDT routes should continue to travel primarily along major thoroughfares and focus on urban corridor, urban area-wide, and regional transportation needs.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  2   B. Interlocal Agreement Because the County has jurisdiction for virtually all transportation services, an interlocal agreement must be established between the County and any municipality intending to either establish or contract to an alternative service provider operations for local circulator services. The interlocal agreement should address the following issues: Reasons for implementing the municipal circulator service Description of the transit services the municipality will provide General requirements that the municipality must adhere to Description of any financial assistance provided by the County Insurance/indemnification for liabilities associated with circulator services Any other relevant issues between the County and the municipality Broward County Model In Broward County, Florida, a partnership has been developed between the County and municipalities to provide local circulator services that complement the services provided by the County transit agency, BCT. The Broward County ""Community Bus Program"" supplies The municipalities vehicles or a capital allowance, administrative support, operator training, route and scheduling assistance, bus-stop signs, and operating funds of $20 per revenue hour. municipality must satisfy minimum operating thresholds including (1) maintaining at least 40 service hours weekly per vehicle, (2) obtaining a ridership requirement of five passengers per revenue hour, and (3) not charging a fare above $0.25. The ""Community Bus Program"" has been very successful in Broward County since its implementation in the early 1990s and the program continues to expand. Currently, fifteen municipalities have entered into the partnership and three other municipalities are in the process of implementing services. Miami-Dade County should consider establishing a similar partnership with municipalities who demonstrate significant local support for circulator services.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  3   C. Risk Management Municipalities are self-insured governmental entities as required by Florida State Statute 768.28. However, municipalities should realize there are specific liabilities associated with providing transit circulator services and institute appropriate risk management programs. Municipalities should also agree to be responsible for the acts or omissions of its agents and employees, and to the extent permitted by law indemnify and hold harmless the County from liabilities and claims. If municipal circulator service is contracted to a private transportation provider, the municipality should require coverage that includes worker's compensation insurance for employees of the contractor, public liability insurance, and automobile liability insurance. The insurance policy should name the municipality and the County as additional insured with respect to the coverage and should indemnify and hold harmless the County from liabilities and claims. The municipality should maintain a certificate of the insurance policy on file and a copy of the insurance policy should be also provided to the County. D. Federal/State Regulations Compliance with all federal and state regulations is mandatory for municipalities initiating transit circulator services. These regulations include but are not limited to drug/alcohol policies, safety training, bus equipment standards, driver licensing, operator hours and shifts. Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs - 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 40 of the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) must be followed. On August 1, 2001, the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) final rule on the Prevention of Alcohol Misuse and Prohibited Drug Use in Transit Operations (49 CFR Part 655) became effective. This new rule replaces FTA's previous drug and alcohol testing rules (49 CFR Parts 653 and 654, respectively.) The basic components of the new rule include (1) testing safety-sensitive employees for the use of controlled substances and the misuse of alcohol and (2) providing educational training on the effects and consequences of drug use. Safety requirements shall be met by complying with Section 341.061(2), Florida Statutes, and Rule 14-90, Florida Administrative Code, concerning system safety. Section 341.061(2) provides that the State of Florida enforce minimum equipment and operational safety standards for all Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  4   governmentally owned bus transit systems and privately owned or operated bus transit systems operating in Florida, which are financed wholly or partly by state funds. Rule 14-90 provides the minimum equipment and operational safety standards for all governmentally owned bus transit systems covered by Section 341.061(2). Rule 14-90 also provides rules for driving requirements, operator hours, and physical examinations for drivers. E. Section 13(c) Labor Protection As a prerequisite to receiving a federal assistance grant from the FTA, Section 13(c) of the Federal Transit Act requires that ""fair and equitable"" protective arrangements must be made by the grantee to protect transit employees. Section 13(c) is known as the labor protection provision of the Federal Transit Act. This statute requires provisions in labor protective arrangements addressing five specific matters: (1) Preservation of rights, privileges, and benefits under existing collective bargaining agreements (2) Continuation of collective bargaining rights (3) Protection of employees against a worsening of their positions with respect to their employment (4) Employment assurance for staff of acquired mass transportation systems and priority of reemployment for staff terminated or laid off (5) Paid training or retraining programs The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is charged with ensuring that Section 13(c) protective conditions are followed. The DOL typically carries out this responsibility by certifying that fair and equitable arrangements are in place for FTA projects. This certification is the last step in a process under which a potential grantee and the union(s), which represent transit employees that may be affected by the federally funded project, develop Section 13(c) protections. If municipalities intend to obtain federal funding to cover a portion of the costs associated with circulator service, awareness of Section 13(c) is important. However, feedback received from MDT staff indicates that implementing municipal transit circulator service does not endanger the jobs of Section 13(c) protected employees as long as the circulator service complements - and Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  5   does not compete with - County transit service. Indeed, municipal circulators may even increase ridership on MDT routes by functioning as a feeder service, which potentially may stimulate the need for more union transit jobs at MDT. F. Americans with Disabilities Act Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is mandated for all public or private transportation providers. The implementing regulation of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act is 49 CFR Part 37. The accessibility specifications for ADA-compliant transportation vehicles are specified in 49 CFR Part 38, which provides minimum guidelines and requirements for vehicles to meet accessibility standards of the ADA. All buses and vans must provide a levelchange mechanism or boarding device, such as a lift or ramp. At least two securement locations must be provided on buses and vans in excess of 22 feet in length, and at least one securement location must be provided on buses and vans 22 feet in length or less. Also required are sufficient clearances to permit a wheelchair or other mobility aid user to reach a securement location. G. Summary of Policy and Legal Issues Table 4-1 on the following page presents a list of general policy and legal issues that municipalities may use as a guide when planning transit circulator service.

Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  7   III. TWO-STEP PLANNING PROCESS Guidelines were developed for municipalities in Miami-Dade County to follow when planning local transit circulator services. These guidelines may be broadly classified into two steps, which should logically follow each other in sequence. ""Step One"" provides general indicators that identify the need for transit circulator service in a municipality or area and gauge the level of community support. ""Step Two"" consists of a specific study that should be conducted only if ""Step One"" determines that transit circulator services may be feasible. This two-step process is recommended as the procedure for developing circulator services. A. Step-One  General Feasibility Study ""Step One"" is envisioned as the initial planning interface between a municipality and MiamiDade County during the development of local transit circulator services. The potential need for circulator service - or lack thereof - and the level of local support will be measured. ""Step One"" may also function as a tool for the County to evaluate several simultaneous requests for circulator services. Communities shown to have the greatest need for circulator service and the highest level of local support should receive priority for County assistance. 1. Indicators of the Need for Transit Service Several socioeconomic characteristics are indicators of areas where local transit circulators might achieve operating success. These socioeconomic indicators include population density, the percentage of elderly citizens, household income, and automobile ownership. Results of our research demonstrate that circulator service is most often successful in areas with population densities greater than 3,000 persons per square mile. Therefore, a population density of 3,000 persons per square mile in the circulator's service area should be established as the minimum population density for community's seeking County assistance. Population densities above 3,000 persons per square mile are common in Miami-Dade County. In fact, many areas in the county have population densities greater than 10,000 persons per square mile. Preference should be given to municipalities with higher population densities when comparing the need for circulator service in different communities.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  8   Population age distribution is useful for determining the demand for circulator services. Elderly persons are more likely to be dependent on the transit system for their mobility. Results of our research indicate that many elderly depend on circulators to access essential locations such as medical facilities, groceries, and governmental services. Preference should be given to communities or areas where greater than 20 percent of residents are over 65 years in age. Low-income households often do not have mobility choices other than public transportation. Areas with low-median household incomes generally have high potential for transit use. Preference should be given to areas with median household incomes below $30,000 (results of the 2000 Census indicate that the median household income in Miami-Dade County is approximately $39,300). Communities with median household incomes below $20,000 should receive the highest preference (results of the 2000 Census indicate that the poverty level for a family of four is $17,600). Areas with a low level of automobile ownership also have a greater propensity to use transit. Preference should be given to communities or areas with higher percentages of households with zero automobiles. Municipalities also must realize that duplication of transit services between proposed circulators and MDT's existing transit system is not desirable. Municipal transit circulators should provide a complementary service to MDT operating on local roadways within the community and serving shorter trips. The municipal circulators may also function as feeders to the MDT system providing residents a means of accessing MDT routes. 2. Indicators of Community Support The level of community support is an important factor in assessing the likely success of local municipal transit service. Local support should be demonstrated before proceeding with planning for a local circulator service. Depending upon its success in securing funding from outside sources, a municipality may also need to fund at least a portion of the costs associated with establishing and operating a circulator service. Our research discovered several communities with socioeconomic characteristics indicative of a propensity for transit use with circulator systems that are achieving poor ridership results. An Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  9   underlying theme in these communities is a lack of marketing for the circulator services. If residents are unaware of the availability or the specifics of the circulator service, achieving significant ridership on the system is difficult. This finding stresses the importance of marketing the circulator service to maximize its benefit to the community. 3. Criteria for Determining Need and Gauging Support Criteria should be established to assist in determining the need and gauging the support for establishing municipal circulator service. These criteria should address the following questions: Is the population density of the area high enough to support fixed-route transit service? Is there a high percentage of transit dependent persons, such as elderly or lowincome? Do recognized gaps exist in the transit service provided by MDT? Do neighborhoods or areas not receive any transit service? Recognized gaps in transit service are defined as areas that are not located within a -mile walking distance of a transit stop. Is there an identifiable demand for trips that could be served by transit circulators, such as trips from medium-density or high-density residential neighborhoods to popular shopping destinations or medical facilities? Are these trips not adequately accommodated by MDT service? Are there potential links or transfer points to MDT service? Are local roadways overcrowded and could circulator service help relieve congestion? Have requests for circulator service been received from citizens, employers, employees, visitors, etc.? If yes, are these groups willing to actively participate in the planning for developing the circulator service? Is the municipality willing to partially or completely fund a feasibility study for transit circulator service? If a municipal circulator is established, does the municipality have a specific budget earmarked for operating and marketing the circulator service?  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  10   Table 4-2 presents a scorecard that was prepared to assist municipalities in evaluating the feasibility for establishing circulator services. This scorecard provides specific criteria that indicate the need and the level of community support for circulator service. The criteria have been weighted so that the evaluation will produce a score. Table 4 - 2: Step-One Evaluation Scorecard  1. Indicators of transit dependency or the propensity to use circulator services. (50 points maximum for A through D) (a) Population density less than 3,000 persons per square mile. (0 points) Population density between 3,000 and 7,500 persons per square mile. (5 points) Population density between 7,500 and 10,000 persons per square mile. (10 points) Population density greater than 10,000 persons per square mile. (15 points) (b) Less than 20 percent of residents aged 65 and older. (0 points) Greater than 20 percent of residents aged 65 and older. (5 points) Greater than 25 percent of residents aged 65 and older. (10 points) Greater than 30 percent of residents aged 65 and older. (15 points) Greater than 35 percent of residents aged 65 and older. (20 points) (c) Median household income greater than $30,000. (0 points) Median household income between $20,000 and $30,000. (5 points) Median household income less than $20,000. (10 points) (d) Greater than 10 percent of households with zero automobiles. (5 points) 2. Recognizable gaps (defined as outside a -mile walking distance from a transit stop) in the community where MDT does not provide transit service. (Yes = 15 points, No = 0 points) 3. Presence of specific activity centers in the community that are not serviced by MDT. (Yes = 10 points, No = 0 points) 4. Often obtain requests for circulator service from citizens, employers, employees, etc. (Yes = 10 points, No = 0 points) 5. Commitment of the municipality to partially or completely fund a feasibility study. (Yes = 10 points, No = 0 points) 6. Identification of a detailed local funding source for the transit circulator service. (Yes = 5 points, No = 0 points)  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  11   In general, a score above 60 points demonstrates that a community is a good candidate for circulator service, a score between 40 and 60 indicates that a circulator service may or may not be feasible, and a score below 40 points demonstrates that a community is a poor candidate for circulator service. The County may also utilize the scoring to prioritize its resources to communities seeking assistance for local circulator services. B. Step-Two  Detailed Feasibility Assessment Framework ""Step Two"" consists of a detailed feasibility study that should only be undertaken if ""Step One"" determines transit circulator service is potentially feasible in the municipality or area. The purpose of ""Step Two"" is to assist in developing operations, management, and financial plans for the circulator service. The operations plan should address route alignments, headways, hours of operation, and vehicle types; the management plan should develop an organizational structure and define roles and responsibilities; the financial plan should provide cost estimates and identify sources of funding. Although each community has specific mobility needs and unique socioeconomic and geographic characteristics, some general recommendations for designing proposed circulator services are provided. These recommendations are based on common elements of the more successful municipal circulator systems identified during our research. 1. Operations Plan The operations plan should identify the circulator system's service characteristics including the locations of the circulator routes, the frequency of service, the days and hours of operation, and the type(s) of vehicle being considered. Based on research and analysis for this study, several trends in terms of operational characteristics were revealed for the more successful transit circulators. These trends are the basis of the general operational recommendations presented below. a. Route Alignment Our review of existing transit circulator systems demonstrated that systems with shorter route lengths tend to have better results in terms of passengers per revenue hour. Routes that meander Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  12   haphazardly through a community typically do not attract as many riders as shorter more direct routes, which do not try to serve every possible mobility need in the community. Chapter 31, Article III, Section 31-113 of the Code of Metropolitan Dade County states that at least 70% of a transit ""circulator service"" route must be within one municipality in order for it to be referred to as a circulator service. Adhering to this rule will generally assist in designing routes that are short enough to maximize the circulator services. Additionally, some smaller land area municipalities might want to explore the possibility of establishing a circulator system in conjunction with a neighboring municipality. b. Headways Headways are an important indicator of transit level of service. Long headways (low frequency service) generally are a detriment to potential users of the circulator system. People may choose not to use the circulator if they fear that ""missing the bus"" will force them to wait a long time before the arrival of the next bus. The costs associated with operating frequent service often force operators to run with 60-minute or longer headways; however, municipalities should strive to achieve lower headways for their circulator systems. Headways of 30 minutes or shorter are strongly recommended for municipalities that are serious about providing a viable transportation alternative for their residents. If possible, ""clockface"" schedules should be developed; these allow the circulator vehicles to pass locations at the same time of the hour. This type of schedule is easier for users to remember and become accustomed to more quickly. ""Clockface"" schedules may be developed with headways of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 60 minutes. Municipal circulator schedules and routes should be coordinated with the schedules and routes of other transit providers to provide ""timed-transfer networks,"" whenever feasible. Coordinated schedules allow passengers to make more seamless transfers and will increase the level of transit service provided by the municipal transit circulator system. Enabling efficient interchange of transit passengers through ""timed-transfer networks"" is even more important when headways are not frequent. Municipal circulator schedules should be designed on the basis of timed transfers.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  13   c. Hours of Operation Careful planning must be undertaken to determine appropriate hours of operations for proposed circulator services. Public input should be obtained during the planning stage to determine the hours of operation that are desirable from the standpoint of the potential riders. Longer hours are desirable from a service standpoint but cost more in terms of labor, fuel, and vehicle maintenance costs. The hours of operation must be longer for municipalities wishing to provide transit circulator service for commuters than for municipalities desiring to provide ""lifeline"" circulator services. Another important issue of consideration is whether or not to provide circulator service on weekends. d. Vehicle Type In terms of vehicle type, a smaller bus with a seating capacity for up to 25 passengers is recommended for transit circulators. Smaller buses are better capable of navigating through different neighborhood environments than standard-sized buses and are not perceived as a nuisance. The circulator vehicles should be easily distinguishable from full-size MDT buses and painted in a color scheme that identifies them as a municipal transit service. All vehicles must be ADA-compliant. For downtown circulator routes, buses with more standing room may be utilized since trips are normally shorter. For suburban neighborhood and ""lifeline"" circulator routes, which are often used for shopping and medical trips, buses should provide plenty of seating and more room for packages and shopping bags. 2. Management Plan The management plan provides an organizational structure and defines roles and responsibilities for operating the circulator system. A key component of the management plan is the recognition of the importance of a marketing strategy. The basic administrative options available to municipalities for circulator services include:  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  14   Operating and maintaining all service with municipal staff Acquiring the circulator vehicles and contracting all or portions of administration, operations, and maintenance activities Contracting out the entire service to a public or private transit service provider All three options offer advantages. A municipality that operates the transit circulator service internally is forced to take a more active role and may become more intrinsically involved with ensuring the system's success. However, municipal staff typically has no experience operating a transit system and the municipality may benefit from having an experienced operator that specializes in the provision of transit services. By contracting the service the municipality may also avoid a major capital investment and may speed up the implementation of circulator service. A marketing strategy is vital for building community support for a circulator system. Marketing for the system may consist of a coordinated blend of research, community outreach, public relations, promotions, and advertising. The marketing strategy should seek to attract riders by: Increasing visibility and awareness of the system Increasing support of the circulator's role in the community Increasing use of the system by providing potential riders with pertinent information 3. Financial Plan The financial plan should provide realistic and reasonably developed estimates for capital and operating costs and identify sources of funding. A host of characteristics impact costs including whether a municipality elects to operate or contract the service to a transit service provider and service characteristics such as the number of routes, length of routes, headways, hours of operation, and fleet size. Funding for circulator service may be obtained from a number of different local, state, federal, and private sources. a. Cost Estimates Operating costs for municipal circulator systems must be determined on a case specific basis, as the costs may vary widely depending on the service characteristics of the system. However, information collected for this study may provide a rough estimate of the costs associated with a Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  15   circulator system. For instance, we estimate the operating costs for a circulator system consisting of two weekday routes operating twelve hours per day with 30-minute headways will approximate $450,000 annually. Additionally, our research demonstrates municipalities that contract the circulator service to a transit service provider typically pay $30 to $45 hourly per vehicle. Municipalities that elect to operate a circulator system may also incur capital costs for the purchase of vehicles. Mini-buses with seating capacity for 14 to 25 passengers typically cost between $55,000 and $110,000. Other types of vehicles including alternative fuel vehicles, electric vehicles, and electric-hybrid vehicles often cost more than standard mini-buses. For example, electric mini-buses range in cost from approximately $210,000 to $250,000; however, the electric mini-buses may introduce significant savings in operating costs through better fuel efficiency. b. Funding Funding for municipal circulator service may be obtained from a number of local, state, federal, and private sources. However, municipal funds are always needed to pay for some portion of the costs. For example, even with the funding assistance provided by the ""Community Bus Program,"" on average Broward County municipalities cover 60 percent of the costs from their general funds. The State of Florida can only fund transit projects at a 100% level in very limited cases such as major corridor projects. Farebox revenue generally accounts for only a small portion of the costs associated with operating circulator services. The majority of municipalities currently operating circulators in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties charge no fare. Municipalities that do charge fares generally recoup less than 10 percent of the operating costs from fare revenues. Other potential local funding sources include ""Special Taxing Districts."" The Code of MiamiDade County supplies the County the authority to establish ""Special Taxing Districts"" to help finance a wide range of public improvements and services, which may include public transit improvements. For example, Miami-Dade County's Metromover (people-mover system) obtains operating assistance from a ""Special Taxing District"" assessment within the City of Miami's Downtown Development Authority area. Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  16   Securing funding from private sources may be possible if the municipal circulators will serve employers or major attractors such as shopping centers. Acquiring funding from private sources also leads to more parties having a stake in the system's success and may foster a sense of community pride. State programs that may be used to help finance municipal transit circulator systems include the State of Florida Transit Block Grant and Service Development programs. In addition, FDOT's Transportation Outreach Program (TOP) provides funds for programs that increase mobility on the state's transportation system and help the region's economy. FDOT's Urban Transit Capital Program offers a source of funding for capital costs associated with acquiring transit vehicles, purchasing land for project facilities, constructing mass transportation facilities, and acquiring computers for operations planning. Several sources of federal funds are available for municipal circulator systems, but the process of securing these funds is highly competitive. The Surface Transportation Program (STP) provides funds for capital projects. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Urbanized Area Formula Transit Grants offer assistance to transit agencies in urbanized areas with populations greater than 200,000 to support capital expenses, and these funds may be shared with municipal transit providers assuming the presence of an interlocal agreement. The Transportation and Community and System Preservation Pilot (TCSP) program provides grants for community preservation and private sector based initiatives; this program might be applicable for communities looking to provide transportation to employment or shopping. The Access to Jobs and Reverse Commute (JARC) Grant Program is available for services that help welfare recipients access employment areas.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  17   IV. POST-IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING After a municipal transit circulator service is implemented, evaluation of the system's performance is needed to ensure the public's mobility needs are served. The circulator system may fail to be responsive to changing needs in the community if the service is not evaluated on a regular basis. Continuing performance monitoring also assists in adjusting services for efficiency and effectiveness. A. Public Involvement A critical component of the post-implementation monitoring program is the maintenance of the public outreach effort that began during the initial planning stages for the municipal circulator system. Public input is important to help define the role of the circulator system in the community. Several methods are available for acquiring public input including: Holding periodic community meetings Conducting rider satisfaction surveys Providing onboard suggestion boxes Participating in community events such as festivals B. Annual Evaluation of Services The municipality should perform an evaluation of the municipal transit circulator service at least on an annual basis. An annual evaluation is usually required by agencies funding all or portions of the circulator service. Section 341.071, Florida Statutes, states that each public transit provider shall establish productivity and performance measures and each provider shall report annually regarding these measures. An annual evaluation provides an opportunity to examine the circulator system to determine if the service is meeting its goals and objectives. If the service is not meeting its goals and objectives, an annual evaluation provides a good forum to analyze and address the underlying reasons why the service may be lacking. In addition to evaluating the circulator system's performance during the annual evaluation, the goals and objectives should be refined based on changing needs in the community.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  18   Measurable goals and objectives should be established during the planning stage for a circulator system for assessment during the annual evaluation process. During the annual evaluation of services, municipalities should also address non-quantitative goals associated with the service such as good public perception and coordination with MDT. The goals and objectives may weigh a number of indicators of system success including ridership, costs, efficiency, and reliability. Measures available to gauge these indicators include: Total passengers Passengers per revenue hour Passengers per revenue mile Cost per passenger On-time performance Based on our research of circulator systems, some sample measurable goals and objectives were developed for guidance purposes for communities that are establishing a circulator system. Table 4-3 presents several sample performance goals. Table 4 - 3: Sample Performance Goals Performance Measure Passengers Per Route (Annual) Passengers Per Revenue Hour Passengers Per Revenue Mile Cost Per Passenger Sample Goal 15,000 5.0 0.3 $6.00  Typical ridership goals for a municipality establishing a circulator system may be 15,000 annual passengers per route, 5.0 passengers per revenue hour, and/or 0.3 passengers per revenue mile (one passenger each three revenue miles). A typical goal for costs may be below $6.00 per passenger. Constant performance improvement is desirable for municipal circulator systems after service is implemented. In order to achieve advancement, performance goals may be periodically adjusted based on percentage improvements such as a ten percent overall increase in annual ridership.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  19   Service goals and objectives should also be established for review during the annual evaluation process. The service goals and objectives should include improvements to be achieved in a clearly specified timeframe. Service goals should be designed to increase the transit level of service leading to increased utilization of the municipal circulator system. Service goals may address a number of items including improving bus-stop facilities and providing better information on circulator services to the public such as timetables and maps. Useful applications of the post-implementation monitoring process include the refinement of existing transit circulator service to better meet the needs of the community. Examples of useful applications of the monitoring process include the following. Realigning existing routes Adding new routes Reducing headways Modifying the hours of operation Modifying schedules to optimize timed-transfers with other transit routes  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  20   V. CONCLUSION The purpose of this study was to provide guidelines for municipalities in planning and implementing municipal transit circulators. Currently, Miami-Dade County sometimes assists with the planning for local transit circulators and municipalities receive grants from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) or other agencies to initiate the circulator service. However, grant support often expires after a period of two to three years and municipalities then must obtain funding from other sources or discontinue the circulator service if new funding sources cannot be secured. This study provides a framework that will (1) provide Miami-Dade municipalities with a good screening and assessment tool for considering local transit circulators and (2) allow Miami-Dade County to better evaluate requests for assistance in planning and establishing municipal circulators. Municipalities can benefit from this study by following the recommended planning process to first determine if transit circulator service is feasible and, if the service is assessed as feasible, to develop a circulator system that serves the community's mobility needs with an improved chance of continued success. This technical memorandum outlined the development of guidelines and standards for establishing municipal transit circulator services and recommended a process for monitoring the circulator services after implementation. General policy and legal issues associated with the implementation of municipal transit circulator services were examined. Broad guidelines were provided for application to all potential municipal circulator services, regardless of the type of service being considered or location, and a list of general policy and legal issues that municipalities may use as a guide when planning transit circulator service was developed. Guidelines were developed for municipalities in Miami-Dade County to follow when planning local transit circulator services. These guidelines were separated into two steps, which should logically follow each other in sequence. ""Step One"" is envisioned as the initial planning effort during the development of local transit circulator services. The potential need for circulator service and the level of local support are measured. A scorecard was developed for this step to assist municipalities in evaluating the feasibility for establishing circulator services.  Local Municipal Transit Circulator Policy Study Technical Memorandum #4  Development of Guidelines and Standards for Local Municipal Circulator Services June 2002  21   ""Step Two"" of the planning process consists of a detailed study that should only be undertaken if ""Step One"" determines transit circulator service is feasible. The purpose of ""Step Two"" is to assist in developing operations, management, and financial plans for the circulator service. The operations plan should address service characteristics; the management plan should develop an organizational structure and define roles; the financial plan should provide cost estimates and identify funding sources. Although each community has specific mobility needs and unique socioeconomic and geographic characteristics, general recommendations for circulator services were provided as guidance in this step. Evaluation of the circulator system's performance after implementation is vital to ensure the public's mobility needs are served. Continuing performance monitoring also assists in adjusting services for efficiency and effectiveness. A critical component of the post-implementation monitoring program is maintaining a public outreach program, as public involvement is important to help define the role of the circulator system in the community. The municipality should also perform an evaluation of the municipal transit circulator service at least on an annual basis; often a monitoring process and annual evaluation is a requirement of funding agencies. Performance and service goals should be established for review during the annual evaluation process and measurable objectives should be developed for assessment. Typical performance measures include annual passengers per route, passengers per revenue hour, costs per passenger, and on-time performance. Examples of useful applications of the monitoring process include revising or adding new routes, adjusting headways, and modifying hours of operation.

Meanwhile, Maryland residents get a chance to show their commitment to the Bay by driving cars sporting ""Treasure the Chesapeake"" commemorative license plates.   By choosing the commemorative plates over the regular Maryland license plates, car owners have generated over $1.7 million in the first six months, well ahead of the projected $1 million they were to raise over a two-year period.    At $20 for the 'standard model' or $100-$500 for the limited editions, the two-plate sets are extremely popular. To date more than 170,000 have been sold.   When an automobile owner buys a set of the blue-and-green plates, the production cost of $10 is returned to the MVA. The remaining money is tax-deductible to the buyer and goes to the not-for-profit Chesapeake Bay Trust, which distributes funds to worthy education and restoration projects.    None of the money goes to pay the Trust's administrative costs, since these are donated by Maryland's Department of Natural Resources.   The Governor's Chesapeake Bay Communications Office did the promotion for the plate, enlisting public service announcements on radio, printing newsletter inserts and making presentations to civic groups and law-makers. ""None of the promotion funds came from the state government,"" said Ellie Falk, deputy director for the office, ""All of it came from the private sector."" For example, 3M Company donated $2,500 of the $12,000 used in marketing the plate program.   In addition to that money, the only other investment has been $5,000 for design of the plate.   When planning distribution, the MVA decided to print 1000 ""limited edition"" sets to be assigned through the Trust on a first-come-first-serve basis. The limited editions, which have raised more than forty thousand dollars, are printed with the word 'Bay' and a very low series of numbers or the owner's choice of numbers. ""One woman selected the numbers 9-1-1 because she felt the Bay was in an emergency situation,"" said Trust Project Manager Rick Leader. The plate, manufactured of recycled aluminum, depicts a great blue heron in its fragile marshland habitat and the motto, ""Treasure the Chesapeake."" The Chesapeake Bay watershed is home to the Atlantic coast's largest great blue heron rookery, a colony of 1,300 breeding pairs.

It is designed to inform the timber and forestry community in that sprawling, resource-rich, state, all about the Board's stream protection efforts. We reprint here the lead story from the Summer 1991 issue. No explanation or elaboration is necessary:    Forestry, the Public and the ""Feedback Loop""  (A message from the California Board of Forestry)   The California Board of Forestry is responsible, under the state's program of implementing the nation's Clean Water Act, for assuring that timber harvest practices on state and private lands are Best Management Practices, or ""BMPs,"" as that term is used in the Act. Simply stated, BMPs are methods, ways of doing business-- in our case harvesting trees--that keep lakes and streams clean and, at the same time, make good forest resource management sense.   The development of California's forest practice BMPs has been a long and sometimes contentious path. To improve water quality protection, the Board of Forestry substantially revised the state's forest practice rules in 1983. While these improved rules have been adopted as BMPs, the law requires a process of monitoring and evaluating their effectiveness prior to federal certification as BMPs. The law also requires their continued improvement on the basis of a monitoring program.The Clean Water Act requires a feedback loop.        To put it in simple terms, we are not      learning from experience...the feedback loop      between research, policy and regulations      seems on the whole to be not only incomplete,      but sometimes quite overlooked.                                 Luna Leopold, 1981.    To avoid the pitfalls that Luna Leopold warns of, the Board of Forestry decided that the best way to design the required monitoring and assessment program would be with the help of both technical experts and the interested public. We felt strongly that public input was key to our understanding of water quality impacts on forest lands. We have organized a panel of advisors, including registered professional foresters, watershed protection specialists, aquatic biologists and others, which we have called the Best Management Practices Effectiveness Assessment Committee, or ""BEAC"". And the BEAC, in turn, has scheduled a series of public workshops, so they can learn from the public -- from anyone who feels he or she has a stake in the relationship between timber harvesting and water qualify protection. The BEAC will be asking which harvest practices appear effective in protecting streams and lakes and which are not, and how that effectiveness, or lack of it, should be measured and evaluated...the BEAC will report its findings to the Board. It will also make recommendations for the design and implementation of a private-land forest practice BMPs monitoring and assessment program. The Board will, in turn, hold both informal and formal discussions of BEAC's recommended program design and will adopt a final program by the summer of 1992.   It is our hope that by bringing our workshops to your community, through volunteer efforts of the BEAC, that you can be an early participant in the ""feedback loop"" of good technical information and honest public concern, which we see as the essential elements of our clean water program.

The first-ever Children's Water Festival in the state was sponsored by the Central Colorado Water Conservancy District and hosted nearly 2,000 children and adults from across the state. The one-day festival, patterned after the Children's Groundwater Festival in Nebraska, was geared toward fourth and fifth graders.   Over 40 classroom activities and displays were situated at Aims Community College for the festival. Numerous local, state and federal agencies assisted with the events, which ranged from presentations on municipal water systems, soil classification, and water sampling techniques to water rap music. One of the most popular games was ""Water Wizards,"" in which schools competed in a quiz. A local TV personality hosted the competition.   The exhibit hall was set up with booths and displays, which included aquifer models and giant bubbles. Gold miners demonstrated the panning process to wide-eyed students and adults alike. Other booths were manned by growers associations, utilities associations, state departments of health and water resources, Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District, EPA, University of Northern Colorado, Colorado State University and the state Division of Wildlife. Future Farmers of America students served as guides during the day.   Response to the festival was amazing. Invitations were sent to schools in January, and the festival filled to capacity in only ten days.   Hopes are that other groups will create their own children's water festivals in the future. Already, plans are under way in other parts of Colorado for festivals in 1992. South Dakota's Department of Agriculture, for example is working on a Section 319-funded festival for next year. The Central Colorado Water Conservancy District, which is hosting their second festival in March '92, will be happy to share their experience with others planning similar events.

Campbell, Jr. signed the state Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction Act on May 27, 1991. The Act charges the state's Land Resources Commission to develop a state stormwater management and sediment reduction program for South Carolina, containing statewide regulations, education, technical assistance, research, design, construction and public involvement components.   The Act requires that all individual land-disturbing activities, with certain exceptions, be carried out according a stormwater and sediment control plan developed specifically for each specific activity by a registered professional and approved by a local government, a soil and water conservation district, or, lacking action by these local agencies, by the state Land Resources Commission, itself.   Periodic inspections are be made and enforcement actions, including fines, are to be assessed by the approving agency, when violations are found.   Exemptions include agriculture and silviculture, single family residences, and regulated mining activities as well as other activities regulated by federal or state environmental permits or licenses. Also exempted are maintenance actions and certain activities conducted by public and private utilities.   Options available to local governments include:     Adopting their own stormwater and sediment control      ordinance.  Using state stormwater management and sediment      control standards and criteria in an existing      ordinance (zoning, subdivision, etc.).  Contracting with conservation districts or others      for local regulatory and enforcement      administration.   In addition, two or more cities and/or counties may join together to administer a program.   If a local government decides not to adopt a program and implement it either directly or through contract with another entity, the South Carolina Land Resources Commission and conservation districts are to administer the program within the jurisdiction of the local government.   There are two other interesting features to the South Carolina legislation:    The Act allows for master planning of a stormwater      management system on a watershed basis by the      establishment of designated watersheds which have      stormwater quality or quantity problems. This      could also apply to watersheds that have the      potential for such problems due to increased land      use conversion. Once a local government designates      a watershed and a watershed master plan is      approved, all projects conducted in the watershed      must be done in accordance with the master plan.    The Act allows local governments to create      watershed-wide stormwater management utilities to      fund, through the collection of user fees, the      operation and maintenance of the stormwater      systems. Under these arrangements local      governments could also make improvements to      existing systems. The utility form is an      alternative to reliance on property taxes and      general fund revenues.   The Land Resources Commission plans to submit regulations for the Act to the General Assembly at the beginning of the 1992 legislative session. With the approval of the regulations, full implementation of the act is expected by June 1992.   [For more information contact Bill Spearman, P.E., Director of Engineering, S.C.

Chvala's Legislative Council Nonpoint Pollution Study Committee has made its recommendations and has received unanimous approval of the Legislative Council of its nonpoint package. The package was the product of several months's study by a group composed of legislators (four Senators and six Representatives) and eleven citizen members representative of ""...environmentalists and builders, lake district officials and realtors, farmers and municipal officials. A balanced committee..."" according to Senator Chvala. (See a related report on the committee and its work in  NPS NEWS-NOTES, #8, October, 1990 .) The proposals are expected to be introduced later this year.   In announcing the Committee's action, Senator Chvala stated:        With the installation of pollution controls      by industry and municipal wastewater      treatment plants, nonpoint source      pollution--broadly defined as run-off from      urban and rural lands--accounts for two-thirds      of water pollution today.   Key among the proposals is legislation which will improve Wisconsin's pioneer priority watershed program. (see  NPS NEWS-NOTES #12, April-May 1991 .) The four principal elements of this proposal are:    Clean Water 2000.  Wisconsin's Department of      Natural Resources (DNR) must begin all priority      watershed projects in the state by the year 2000.      Of the 330 watersheds in Wisconsin, DNR has      identified roughly 130 which have been severely      degraded by nonpoint pollution. DNR has begun only      51 projects since the priority watershed program      started in 1978, and has completed only 6.    Water Quality Goals.  DNR must establish water      quality goals at the beginning of each priority      watershed project, and DNR must persuade      landowners to volunteer for the program by      offering 70 percent cost-sharing to install      best-management practices (more in cases of      economic hardship).    Grace Period.  After an initial three year      voluntary sign-up period, DNR must determine if it      will achieve water quality goals. If not, it must      contact critical nonparticipants and encourage      them to volunteer during a six-month grace period.    Bad Actor Provision.  After sign-up and grace      periods, DNR could require participation of      critical nonparticipants whose nonpoint pollution      is causing DNR to fail in meeting its water      quality goals. Those bad actors required to      participate will be eligible for only a loan      subsidy or a 25 percent grant.    ""This should provide a strong incentive to volunteer, hopefully greatly limiting the need for enforcement,"" Chvala said.   The NPS legislative package includes five additional measures:    Cows out of streams.  The state's Department of      Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP)      is directed to develop a model livestock exclusion      ordinance and to encourage counties to adopt it by      1995. The Wisconsin Conservation Corps would be      granted set-aside monies to give priority to      projects helping counties implement the ordinance.    Drainage Districts.  DATCP would have the authority      to set performance standards for drainage      districts and order corrections for districts      where poor maintenance allows large amounts of      sediment to enter navigable waters.    Construction site erosion.  The Department of      Industry, Labor and Human Relations (DILHR) would      regulate construction site erosion at one- and      two-dwelling unit sites. Further, DNR must revise      the existing model ordinance to regulate erosion      at the site of all other land-disturbing      activities. Counties would be required to adopt      and enforce the ordinance. DNR and DILHR would      develop a training program for local enforcement      officials and could issue stop-work orders to      ensure compliance.    Financial provisions.  To help cover costs, the      proposed legislation would provide the expanded      nonpoint source program with $93 million of      bonding authority, and impose a $7.50      environmental surcharge on motor vehicle title      transfers and a fee on road salt to be paid by      highway authorities.    Farmland Preservation Tax Credit.  In separate but      more controvercial legislation, the committee      recommended increasing the Farmland Preservation      Tax Credit by $18 million by using unspent state      lottery monies. Under current law, soil      conservation plans are required of farmland      preservation tax credit recipients. Senator Chvala      observed, ""Unfortunately, both the average size of      tax credits and participation in the program have      tapered off. The new benefits will work to      increase participation. This will help reduce      nonpoint pollution and provide farmers with an      important boost at this critical time in the farm      economy.""

GX246-54-3335627	Previous  |  Next      Celebrating The Federal Investment In  MASS TRANSIT      P L A N N I N G    WHERE IT ALL GETS STARTED                “I Thought That We’d Been   Forgotten.” After a     ceremony in Los Angeles in 1999 to dedicate a Livable Communities project, the FTA     Administrator spoke with some people who had been in attendance, and the people expressed     what the new transit station meant to them. It means hope. “I thought that we’d     been forgotten,” one elderly woman said as her eyes filled with tears.              Since 1993, FTA has taken the   lead  in encouraging the practice of combining   land-use planning with transit planning and working with our transit agency partners to go   the extra mile to ensure that new transportation investment will not simply build a rail   line or upgrade a bus system, but produce added vitality for the community it serves.   Thus, FTA’s  Livable Communities Initiative (LCI)  was born.      The concept of livable communities is at the heart of the transit assistance program   FTA manages. The initiative promotes enhancements to make transit facilities more   “user friendly,” such as improving pedestrian flow into and out of transit   stations; building child-care centers in subway terminals to make it easier for parents to   drop off and pick up their children at the end of the work day; centering retail activity   around transit facilities so people can incorporate errands into their commute. An   additional outcome of the livable communities initiative which has proven highly   beneficial is that non-federally funded livable community and transit oriented development   projects have sprung up on their own. Transit operators are truly becoming mobility   managers—incorporating customer needs and innovative financing goals into nearly   every capital investment under consideration.      A transit station brings not only a building, trees and benches, but opportunities,   ambition and respect. Now the people in the community can apply for and get to a job   across town; now they can take a class at night to improve their skills; now they can   visit the doctor or dentist, and they can move ahead.                                      Under The Livable Communities Initiative:  Twenty-four capital transit projects   costing  $52 million leveraged over $118 million  in local funds.      Over $1.3 million in local planning  efforts have been allocated to 14 of these   communities for further public involvement to ensure that the projects best met the needs   of the communities. Of the original 24 projects, sixteen Empowerment Zones and Enterprise   Communities have been provided over $33 million in direct capital or planning assistance.      Among the community service components at the projects are day care, health care,   police substations, job training and employment services and transit planning services.   Most of the projects have safety and passenger amenity elements that make the transit   accessibility and transfer connections user-friendly and provide a   bike/pedestrian-friendly environment.                    In 1995, the Mayor of Los Angeles  selected transit-dependent neighborhoods to       participate in the “Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative” (LANI). Twelve       neighborhoods received assistance through the Los Angeles County Metropolitan       Transportation Authority to develop plans for their area, and FTA supported eight of these       projects.  The LANI Board determined that the neighborhoods felt disconnected; one of       the solutions would need to provide a way to connect or link neighborhoods. City and FTA       funding was used for planning, design, engineering and pedestrian amenities. Trees were       planted, light fixtures were painted and beautiful colored banners, designed by local       students, were hung, all providing a feeling of connection to the community.                                                 In 1996, Corpus Christi Regional       Transportation Authority  decided to construct three       bus transfer facilities within predominantly minority communities. Close to 43 percent of       the households in Corpus Christi are Hispanic. The FTA funded the centers and many of the       customer-driven amenities that make the structures part of the community.                        Corpus Christi:               “Es lo                 Nuestro.”            (“It is ours.”)                           “Es lo nuestro,” “it is ours”–is how the community feels about       the transfer stations. Residents were involved in the design and manufacture of the tile       for the Staples Street and Port Ayers Stations. The Staples Street Station—the winner       of a Presidential Design Award—is located in downtown, across from City Hall, and       also serves as an employment center. Residents now have improved access with wider       sidewalks, better lighting, colorful landscaping, bus stops and shelters, along with       safety enhancements. The beautiful mosaic tile work depicts scenes of Hispanic culture and       stands as a testament to the rich cultural heritage and spirit of the community.                      The Wellston MetroLink Station in St.       Louis, Missouri,                                                   is a shining example of what can happen when a community comes together to partner with       local and Federal programs.                                                       The city had an unemployment rate 2.5 times the regional       average; violence in the area was bad and worsening; and much of the once thriving       business district was gone.            Through he LCI grant and local resources, extensive community outreach identified       priority projects. Improvements at the station include a Park-N-Ride facility, the       installation of a public art project and distinctive new signage. Street improvements       along the main entrance and a new pedestrian pathway that will feature an artist-designed       fence are being completed. A child care facility adjacent to the station is being planned       and the Economic Council of St. Louis County is building on these improvements and       aggressively moving forward with the development of the Technology Center.                                       In Columbus, Ohio, the Central Ohio       Transit Authority’s (COTA) Livable Communities Program  has two projects that will bring new life and investments to the citizens of the       Columbus Urban Empowerment Zone. COTA is developing two transit centers, one located in       the new Easton, a planned development that is estimated will provide 43,000 jobs when       completed. The other is in the Linden neighborhood and directly serves Empowerment Zone       residents. The Linden project, located between residential and manufacturing       neighborhoods, was developed in coordination with the Columbus Urban Growth Corporation.       This public/private venture includes child care, medical care, job locator and training       services, public and private office space and retail, including the first bank branch ever       located in this community. COTA is improving pedestrian movements and safety features that       provide better access to this Transit Center. In addition, a major element of the Easton       Transit Center is a park and ride facility that will allow access to the Easton       development internal circulator system.                         Economic Benefits         of Transit             During the 1990’s,            transit returned $23 billion annually to the national economy in affordable mobility;            $9.4 billion per year in annual reduced congestion delays for rush-hour passengers and           motorists was realized;            $10 billion was saved per year in reduced auto ownership costs for residents of location           efficient neighborhoods;            Up to $12 billion per year in reduced auto emissions was saved;            $12 billion a year in local human service agency budgets was saved;            and there was a 2 percent boost per year in property tax receipts from commercial real           estate locating near transit.                                                                           Location Efficient Mortgages   (LEM)  are an embodiment of the principles of the   Livable Communities Initiative. In October 1997, the Federal National Mortgage   Association, better known as Fannie Mae, the nation’s leading mortgage company,   agreed to underwrite an experimental home loan program to account for auto cost savings   households are able to achieve in transit- intensive neighborhoods. The LEM was born and   developed with funds and staff support from the FTA. When a home is located in a   neighborhood with quality transit services, the homebuyer is able to qualify for a higher   mortgage, owing to savings in auto ownership costs. LEM programs are underway in Chicago,   San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Seattle.               Americans living in  transit-intensive metropolitan areas save $20 billion per year.       People living in walkable transit communities drive fewer miles and thus have lower       transportation expenses.        Almost half of the nation’s       Fortune 500 companies,  representing over $2       trillion in annual revenue, are headquartered in America’s transit-intensive       metropolitan areas.        The savings associated with       locating in walkable neighborhoods  increase the       borrowing power of businesses and households. The adoption of LEMs by the home loan       industry at large could generate $300 billion in new loans over a seven-year period.          Previous  |  Next
GX014-96-13508291	"Printer friendly version   Editor's Note: As the Laboratory's 2004 United Way campaign continues       through November, the Daily Newsbulletin will periodically publish news       stories about   United Way agencies. As of last Thursday, about $74,000 has been raised in       pledges and donations in this year's campaign.        Yvonne Maestas looks over a number of stoves donated to Habitat for     Humanity's ReStore. Habitat for Humanity is a United Way provider agency.  Photo courtesy of Community Relations (CRO) Office   ReStore finds new uses for old materials   Northern New Mexico residents needing home repairs on a tight budget now have   a valuable ally in the Habitat For Humanity ReStore at the corner of U.S. 84-285   and Boneyard Road in Arroyo Seco. The warehouse and its yard are filled with   building materials and supplies -- everything from windows and doors to sinks, stoves, lighting fixtures, paint and small hardware items.   Most are sold to the public for pennies on the dollar, compared to retail   prices, but some new items are priced at 50 percent of the original price.   ""There are about 50 ReStores throughout the United States,"" said   manager Yvonne Maestas. ""They were started because contractors and individuals   like to donate building materials to Habitat for Humanity. In the past, we'd   use what we could on our building projects and then have a yard sale. But we   just had so much stuff that we needed to do this fulltime.""   Habitat for Humanity, a United Way agency whose mission is to partner with   families in need of decent housing, manages the ReStore, with the assistance   of other community partners and neighbors.   ""It's been really exciting,"" Maestas said. ""The store is empowering   families to do their own home repairs, even if they thought they couldn't afford   it. We have exterior doors for $25, which is a significant saving. A single   mom came in recently who had no interior doors in her house. The family had   been living for years with curtains hanging in doorways and she was able to   have doors for the first time.   ""What's great about Habitat for Humanity is that you see immediate results,"" Maestas   said.   Some unusual donations have included hot tubs, which sold quickly, and two   pianos. ""We had never had a piano donated before and we had two at once,   one from Dixon and one from Los Alamos,"" Maestas said.   Between 20 and 60 customers daily, some from as far away as Taos and Questa,   visit the ReStore, to browse the aisles of donated materials, to volunteer   at the cash register or just to socialize.   Maestas has been on the staff at Habitat for Humanity for five years and has   volunteered for seven. She said the organization survives on sales from the   ReStore and contributions from United Way, which recently added Habitat   for Humanity to its list of member agencies.   ""The partnership with United Way has been a blessing,"" she said. ""When   I first signed on, we had no funds and we just worked really hard all of the   time. Now we are able to look around for property to build houses on and pay   off the ones we had already purchased.""   The Española Valley and Los Alamos chapter is about to begin its third   new construction project. Maestas explained that in the Española Valley,   a larger need is home repair; she said Habitat for Humanity recently completed   its 21st home repair project.   ""It's sometimes difficult to find clients for new homes who meet our   guidelines,"" she said. ""But most of the home repairs have been for   elderly people and the sweat equity they contribute can be making coffee or   lunch or doing paperwork.""   Most of the ReStore's volunteers are elderly, so Maestas is particularly grateful   for the help the agency receives from some of its neighbors.   ""Some of the local contractors and businesses have really supported us,"" Maestas   said, noting that a local company, Rios Salvage, demolished an apartment complex   and gave the ReStore 40 stoves. ""They have also given us insulation and   lumber over the years,"" she added.    The ReStore is open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Monday through Wednesday, 10   a.m. to 4 p.m., Thursday and Friday and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Saturday. All donations   are tax deductible.

Housing Department Role    The Redevelopment Agency has provided the sites for homes constructed in Cathedral City.   The homes constructed through Habitat are an extremely cost-effective method for the Redevelopment Agency to provide ownership opportunities for hard-working but very-low-income families.

GX023-36-8529106	March 19, 2002             County to Sell Parcels      to Habitat for Humanity      Land to be used for affordable housing                  (Seattle, Wash.) -   The Metropolitan King County Council’s Growth      Management and Unincorporated Areas Committee acted today, recommending that      King County sell two unused parcels of land to Habitat for Humanity for the      purpose of affordable housing.             “The Habitat for Humanity program creates simple, decent housing and offers      the joys and responsibilities of home ownership for families,” said Growth      Management and Unincorporated Areas Committee Chair Jane Hague. “Without      this sale, the property would sit idle. By working  with  Habitat for      Humanity, the County is able to help support affordable housing while      placing the property on the County tax rolls.”            The County-owned properties currently have no sewer available and access is      undeveloped. The conditions make the properties difficult to develop, both      physically  and  economically. Since Habitat for Humanity owns      adjoining property, development of the three properties for affordable      housing becomes feasible and cost effective.             “With a modest public investment, these undeveloped parcels become vibrant      homes within the Federal Way community,” said Hague. “Habitat for Humanity      is making a real difference in King County by building affordable housing in      partnership with residents earning between 25 and 50 percent of median      income.  It is particularly exciting to know that new homeowners in the      Habitat program have been willing to commit at least 500 hours in ‘sweat      equity’ during the construction process.”            The two parcels are located at SW 369 th  Street and 1 st       Avenue South in Federal Way. The parcels were acquired by King County      through foreclosure sales for delinquent real estate taxes. As part of the      sale agreement, Habitat for Humanity will pay all back taxes associated with      the properties.             -End-                                                                         HOME  |      COUNCILMEMBERS    |  NEWS   |        LEGISEARCH      |       C OUNTY CODE      |        C TV       King  County Home  |  King County News   |  King County Services  |  Comments  |   Search     This page was last updated on   02/06/03    Links to external sites do not  constitute endorsements by King County.

GX044-77-3025753	"Montgomery County Council   June 1998     FROM THE DESK OF COUNCILMEMBER DERICK BERLAGE: Berlage Budget Report    I am pleased to report that the Council has completed its work on Montgomery County's budgets and that our communities fared very well.  Overall, the Council adopted a $1.9 billion operating budget and a capital improvements program budget totaling $1.5 billion.  I have outlined below what these budgets mean for the projects and programs we care about.    Schools:    Funding for schools and, in particular, funds to reduce class size remain a top priority for me.  This was a banner year for the school budget.  Half of the County's operating budget, $1  billion , went to the school system.  This appropriation represents an increase of $76 million or 8% over last year's budget.  I am especially pleased to report the Council specifically approved    $9.3 million for a multi-year plan to reduce class size and improve student performance by adding 238 teaching positions.  While this initiative is a major step forward, reduction in class sizes cannot be accomplished overnight.  I will continue to be a leader for additional classroom resources in the years to come.   While hotly debated, a majority of my colleagues agreed to support    $3 million in additional funds for Blair at Wayne Avenue bringing the total funding for this project to $16 million.  This project will convert the current high school into a middle school and an elementary school.  These two new schools will solve the overcrowding problem in the Blair Cluster schools resulting from the unification of Takoma Park and increased birth rates in the cluster.     The new Blair High School is almost complete and will open this fall.  A $900,000 funding request for the final furniture and equipment needs; and the lighting and sound equipment for the auditorium is pending before the Council.  I expect the Council to approve the request shortly.   The school modernization program, including Glenhaven Elementary School, remains on schedule.  Four new elementary school gyms were added to the program including a new gym for Rock View Elementary School.  The Takoma Middle School modernization is well underway.  The Council also added nine new schools to the modernization list to begin construction within the next six years including Kensington Parkwood Elementary School.  Finally, the Council approved funding, totaling $8 million, for the 12 room addition to Wheaton High School.   In summary, the Council approved a capital budget for schools totaling $535 million which represents almost half of the County's capital budget.  This budget provides for 43 major school improvements, including 15 new schools and 28 school modernizations.    Revitalization Efforts:    As the Councilmember who represents some of the oldest communities in the county, efforts to rejuvenate and enliven our neighborhoods and downtowns are also a high priority for me.  As a result, I fought hard to protect the Renew Montgomery program from budget cuts.  This program replaces and repairs aging curbs, gutters, and sidewalks to give a fresh look to our neighborhoods.   This Council, unanimously, took unprecedented action in appropriating $132 million for the Town Center project for downtown Silver Spring.  I cannot recall a time when a Council appropriated such a large sum in one single action.  Traditionally, the Council only appropriates funds necessary to carry a project through to the next budget cycle.  Such a bold step sends a strong message to the financial markets and the retail industry that we mean business!  It also means decision makers have finally taken notice of communities east of the Rock Creek !  This is due to the hard work of many dedicated community leaders like you who refused to give up on Silver Spring.  I am grateful and I am pleased I could do my part by getting the funding approved.     County funds will be used to build a new civic building; a renovated Silver Theater for use by the renowned American Film Institute; a new veterans memorial as well as enhanced streetscaping; fountains; a town square and other amenities to give the project a sense of place; and to construct parking garages which are vital to the success of this project.  The developers hope to proceed swiftly to the Planning Board with their project plans and are busy soliciting tenants.    In a very quiet victory for our revitalization efforts, the Council approved almost $10 million to begin the renovation and expansion of the Takoma Park campus of Montgomery College.  The College will enliven the streets of south Silver Spring and remain a stable force in Takoma Park.  This project, which includes the renovation of the Jesup Blair Park, is a win-win for the students, park users, residents, and the business community.   In Wheaton, the Council approved the funding for the Wheaton Market Place project.  This project will increase parking spaces, enhance the pedestrian access to the parking lot and improve the overall environment.  These improvements will assist all those wonderful small businesses in the Wheaton Triangle to thrive.     For Long Branch, at my request the Council approved $400,000 to match the funds provided in Delegate Sheila Hixson's bond bill to help with the ongoing efforts of folks like Cynthia Rubenstein and Jim Melton to improve the quality of life in their community.   The funding for ongoing revitalization efforts in Kensington, Four Corners, and Fenton Street Village continues to enjoy the support of the Council.  Funds were added to initiate similar efforts in Glenmont.    Parks, Recreation, Libraries:    The Council, after much debate, agreed to provide $230,000 for renovation of the Lee Jordan ballfields located at Takoma Middle School.  These upgraded fields will be used by the city's youth baseball, softball and soccer programs, which enroll almost 2,000 children from Takoma Park and neighboring communities.   Five parks will be ready for active use by the end of the year.  Fairview Urban Park, thirty years in the making, is about ready.  It would not have been possible without the diligent efforts of Dean Gibson, Jon Lourie, Susan Miles and the generosity of Woodside Park.  And, General Getty Neighborhood Park is virtually complete due to the tireless efforts of Barbara Ashe.  We should also soon see children playing at New Hampshire Estates Neighborhood Park, Bullis Local Park, and Brookview Local Park.  These small parks are invaluable to the quality of life in our neighborhoods.    In response to the burgeoning popularity of youth soccer, the Council, with my leadership, approved planning money for a state-of-the-art soccer facility which will include a number of soccer fields, an indoor soccer facility and an outdoor soccer stadium.  This is a joint venture with the Maryland Soccerplex Foundation.  No doubt, soccer families will appreciate having a first-class facility in the county.   Demolition of the old Rosemary Hills Community Recreation Center and construction of the new 23,500 square foot community center will begin this summer.  The Parks Department will also renovate the adjoining park.   The Community Center staff will be housed nearby to keep programs available to area youth during construction.  The new Community Center is scheduled to open in November 1999.   With regard to libraries, $1.6 million was included in the capital budget for a major renovation of the Long Branch Library.  This project, to begin in 2000, was moved ahead of the Bethesda Library renovation.  The Council also approved funds to study an urban library concept.  This study is essential to our efforts to place a new library in downtown Silver Spring.  Frankly, I believe we deserve a regional library and that is my goal for the next capital budget debate.    Transportation/Pedestrian Safety:    In an effort to combat our traffic woes, I led the fight on two mass transit initiatives.  At my request, the Council reinstated the ""Fare Share"" program, an incentive program to increase use of mass transit.  The County offers discounted  fares to employers who match the County's discount and then pass along the discounted fares to their employees.  Fare Share was very successful, 60% of the participants were new transit users, before it fell to the budget ax during the recession.  I also pushed hard for the expansion of the C-8 Metro bus service at a cost of $800,000.  The bus will now run from White Flint, Glenmont, to College Park and it will run throughout the day instead of just during rush hour.      To address the need for pedestrian safety along Georgia Avenue across the Beltway ramps, I fought hard to convince my colleagues to provide $250,000 to design the Forest Glen Pedestrian Bridge.  This funding is necessary to ensure this project stays on track and citizens have significant input into the design and scope.  I hope we can count on you to provide your comments.    Water/Sewer Bills:    We all know government moves slowly.  I never appreciated how slowly until I took on the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) bureaucracy in an attempt to reign in their spending habits.  In 1994, I created a spending control program that my colleagues imposed on WSSC.  After dogged efforts these controls have finally paid off, literally!  For the first time since 1980, you will  not  see an increase on your WSSC bill!    Several years ago, I also initiated a separate effort to keep even more money in your pocket.  It is called the Systems Development Charge (SDC).  This is a fee developers must pay towards the cost of new water and sewer lines necessary for new development.  Before SDC, WSSC passed these costs along to you, instead of developers.   This year alone, with the recently adopted increase in the SDC fees, you and I, the WSSC ratepayers, will collectively save $28 million.     Tax Bills:    I am very proud to note after years of effort by both Councilmember Potter and myself, the Council enacted a supplement to the State's ""circuit breaker"" program which provides property tax relief to lower income homeowners.     Mr. Potter introduced the legislation during his tenure as County Executive and I was the Council's leading proponent of this measure.  Finally, together with Councilmember Ewing's help, we were able to convince the current Council and County Executive of the vital need for this tax credit.  This is especially important to homeowners whose property values have increased but whose incomes have not kept pace.   I fought off attempts to reduce the income tax rates.  Such a cut would be extremely detrimental to our priorities such as the school system's plan to reduce class size as well as the school's modernization schedule.  But, you will see reductions on your tax bill this year!  The Council approved a total package of tax reductions of $18.5 million.  We lowered the property tax rate; authorized a separate property tax rebate against the amount of income tax you pay; and lowered the trash fees which appear on your tax bill.  Your bill may be lowered by $51.   This was a very busy budget season for District 5 and we had many great accomplishments which I wanted to share with you.  I appreciate the time you took to read my Budget Report and hope you found it informative.

GX053-39-8177838	March 25, 2002       Council approves Sale of     Parcels to Habitat for Humanity      Land to be used for affordable housing             For information contact: Jane     Hague 206 296-1011       The Metropolitan King County Council today     approved the sale of two surplus properties to Habitat for Humanity for the     purpose of affordable housing.       “The Habitat for Humanity program creates     simple, decent housing and teaches the principles of home ownership,” said     the initiative’s sponsor Councilmember  Jane     Hague . “Without this sale, the property would sit idle. By working  with      Habitat for Humanity, the County is able to help provide affordable housing     and put another property owner on the County tax rolls.”       The County-owned properties currently have no     utilities and access is undeveloped. The conditions make the properties     difficult to develop, both physically and economically. Since Habitat for     Humanity owns adjoining property, development of the three properties for     affordable housing becomes feasible and cost effective.       “With a modest public investment, these     undeveloped parcels become vibrant homes within the Federal Way community,”     said Hague. “This is yet another exciting opportunity to partner with     Habitat for Humanity to create affordable housing within King County.”       The two parcels are located at SW 369 th  Street     and 1st Avenue South in Federal Way. The parcels were acquired by King     County through foreclosure sales for delinquent real estate taxes. Each     12,000 square foot property has an assessed value of $20,000. As part of the     sale agreement, Habitat for Humanity will purchase the properties for     $3,500, the amount of back taxes associated with the properties.       “We are truly grateful for King County’s     continued support,” said Diane Gallegos, the executive director of Habitat     for Humanity of South King County. “The greatest limiting factor in     providing affordable housing is the increased cost of property, so the     opportunity to purchase property at this very reasonable price allows us to     provide affordable housing for more South King County residents.”       Habitat for Humanity of South King County     builds housing in partnership with South King County residents earning     between 25 and 50 percent of median income. The partner homeowners are     required to give at least 500 hours “sweat equity” in helping to build     their home.       -End-                                                                HOME  |      COUNCILMEMBERS    |  NEWS   |        LEGISEARCH      |       C OUNTY CODE      |        C TV       King  County Home  |  King County News   |  King County Services  |  Comments  |   Search     This page was last updated on   02/06/03    Links to external sites do not  constitute endorsements by King County.

GX024-08-4755791	January 17, 2003             Irons Appointed to Habitat      Board         Metropolitan King      County Councilmember David Irons was appointed last week to a two-year term      on the Board of Directors of Habitat for Humanity of East King County.       Irons, a      Sammamish resident, has volunteered for three years with the non-profit      organization, wielding a shovel and swinging a hammer on home-building      projects at Snoqualmie Ridge, Newcastle and Redmond sites.       “I believe      everyone should contribute what skills they have to offer in efforts that      improve our communities,” Irons said.  “I enjoy building with wood and      concrete at a homesite as much as I enjoy building partnerships and      consensus on the King County Council. Now, I am honored to have an      opportunity to meld these two interests in serving on the Habitat for      Humanity Board.”       Irons became      involved with Habitat for Humanity through his church, First United      Methodist Church at Pine Lake, which joins other churches in recruiting      members for building parties.  Irons’ home-building experience includes a      variety of work, from digging foundations to framing walls.       Formed in 1976 in      Georgia ,      Habitat for Humanity uses volunteers, no-interest loans and donations to      help families in need to build and buy their own homes.  The non-profit,      ecumenical Christian housing ministry puts together partnerships to build      simple, affordable homes all over the world. Locally, the East King County      affiliate was established in 1988 and currently is working on projects to      build 50 single-family homes at Snoqualmie Ridge and 24 townhomes at      Patterson Park in Redmond. Other projects completed recently include six      duplex townhomes at Coal Creek Terrace in Newcastle, and five duplex      townhomes at Overlake in        Bellevue .

(ICAA)   A $13,020 grant            will be used to draft property rehabilitation standards that IHFA grantees            will adhere to when undertaking rehabilitation activities funded with            IHFA HOME funds, Community Development Block Grants, or the Low Income            Housing Trust Fund. Through this process, ICAA will review existing            standards in Indiana and other states, get feedback from affordable            housing providers, create a rehabilitation standard that is acceptable            to IHFA, and then train providers on the final established standard.           Southern            Indiana Rural Development Project, Inc. (SIRDP)   A $11,162            grant will be used to reprint the  Live the DreamOwn a Home              homeownership education curriculum. In October 1997, IHFA and Cinergy/PSI            provided funding to SIRDP to create  Live the DreamOwn a Home  ,            a homeownership education program. Since that time, this homeownership            curriculum has been used throughout the State in 245 classes for 4,094            Hoosiers.           IHFA provides resources and technical assistance in a fiscally responsible            manner to stimulate affordable housing opportunities in Indiana. As            an agent of Indiana's economic development policy, IHFA works with its            partners to build stable communities for the residents of Indiana.           Since 1997, IHFA financed the purchase, development or rehabilitation            of more than 32,400 affordable homes for Hoosiers to rent or own, representing            a total planned investment of more than $1.9 billion. IHFA is financially            self-sufficient and operates without state tax revenues.

GX052-78-10034039	REQUEST FOR ADVISORY OPINION 99-43     The Commission on Ethics and Public Trust considered your request for an advisory opinion at its meeting on October 13, 1999 and rendered its opinion based on the facts stated in your letter.     You requested an opinion regarding fund- raising activities by the Department of Planning and Zoning on behalf of Habitat for Humanity.    In your letter, you advised the Commission that the Department of Planning and Zoning is considering volunteering as a department to assist in construction of a home for Habitat for Humanity. The activity is voluntary and will occur on Saturdays. The project requires the department to solicit funds from businesses to defray construction expenses. The contributions would be made directly to the organization. Some of the businesses contacted for contributions conduct business with the department.     The Commission found that The Conflict of Interest and Code of Ethics ordinance permits the department volunteers to construct the home and solicit funds from private contributors to underwrite the costs but the department should refrain from soliciting money from contractors of the department and other parties who are currently doing business with the department. Section 2- 11.l(e)(3) permits employees to solicit funds for a charitable organization.      Therefore, the employees may seek private financial assistance to defray the cost of the construction of the home. However, the department should seek contributors outside of department vendors and persons doing business with the department because it creates the appearance of a conflict of interest.      Please be advised that the Commission on Ethics advisory opinion is only applicable to the Miami-Dade County Conflict of Interest Ordinance and not the State of Florida Code of Ethics. Any questions regarding interpretation of the state Code of Ethics should be referred to the State of Florida Commission on Ethics.
GX035-36-10002273	June 1, 2000    Rebuilding Los Alamos    Habitat For Humanity, the Los Alamos/Española chapter, is searching for a few properties to purchase on which to build affordable housing for qualified clients, such as fire fighters, teachers and police officers. Leads, suggestions and/or offers to sell are sought. We would like to rebuild homes, or build condominiums, on properties destroyed by the fire. If anyone is planning to sell and move elsewhere, rather than rebuild, why not sell to Habitat For Humanity?    If the Laboratory has any way to provide a land grant or to arrange a national forest land grant, or to work with Los Alamos County to provide a land grant from the parcels that are undeveloped, now is a good time to work with Habitat For Humanity to providing affordable housing in Los Alamos. A real estate trust, permanently reserving multi-unit development for use as affordable housing has been done by Habitat elsewhere, and is being investigated for local application. If there is any way the county, the Laboratory, the Forest Service or land owners could help us obtain suitable property for affordable housing development, we need the help.    Anyone having suggestions, ideas, useful information or offers to sell may e-mail Dale Kemp at  dalekemp@lanl.gov  or phone 7-7700. The local chapter has completed several building maintenance or improvement projects in both Los Alamos and Española and has just started construction of it first ground up home construction project. The National Habitat For Humanity organization is ready to provide assistance to the local affiliate for disaster recovery.    Other local Habitat For Humanity information:    There is a silent auction of art going on to support the local Habitat work. The art is on display at R Books in Los Alamos. Due to the fire, the auction is being extended, probably to the end of June. Stop by and enjoy the art, and make a tax deductible bid on it if you like.    The chapter operates a building materials recycling store in Espanola, called the Puerta Verde. The Chapter's Web site is  http://www.la-tierra.com/habitat-evla/index.html.  The location of the Puerta Verde recycling store can be found on the website, or call (505) 747-2690. Donations of cash, building materials, labor or even developable property are always welcome. Donations sent to the National Habitat For Humanity organization do not come back to the local chapter. If you want your donation to have local impact, please give to the local Habitat chapter. There also are chapters in Santa Fe and Albuquerque that have built many affordable homes in their communities.    Working together, we can rebuild Los Alamos. Let's rebuild it no less affordable than it was.    --Dale Kemp       Reader's Forum    Forum archive
GX047-83-11831380	"June 5, 2000   Celebrating National Homeownership Week       U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development news release   Seattle, WA. - Today the Seattle King County Partners in Homeownership held a kick-off event to celebrate National Homeownership Week.   The Seattle-King County Partners gathered at 23rd and Columbia to help Seattle Habitat for Humanity dedicate two homes to two immigrant families who will soon own a piece of the American Dream.  The sponsors of the homes are Seattle Mortgage Bankers Association, HomeStreet Bank and the Gary Payton Foundation.    Emceed by Bob Santos, HUDs Secretarys Representative, todays speakers included Mayor Paul Schell, King County Executive Ron Sims, Linda Murtfeldt, Executive Director of Seattle Habitat for Humanity, Charles H. Mitchell, President of Seattle Central Community College, David Hatlen, President of Seattle Mortgage Bankers Association, Edward Murphy, President of Seattle-King County Association of REALTORS and Jim Potter of the Master Builders Association. Gary Payton, Seattle SuperSonics point guard, shared the podium with Seattle Habitat for Humanity as the homes were dedicated to the new owners. Kim Herman, Executive Director, Washington State Housing Finance Commission, read the Governors Declaration of Homeownership Week.   The homes have been purchased by the families, who helped in the actual construction.  The homes are part of the City of Seattles Design Demonstration project which allowed the construction of two homes on one lot. Habitat purchased the surplus property from King County using funds from HUDs Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program.    Mayor Schell said,  ""Habitat for Humanity has been a valuable ally to us in Seattle, giving many families the opportunity to achieve the dream of home ownership. I commend all of the partners who have stepped up to the challenge of providing affordable home ownership opportunities.""    King County Executive Ron Sims said, King County is committed to working with all our partners to make homeownership attainable for all families in our communities.    June 3-10 is National Homeownership Week and throughout the country hundreds of communities are hosting events to strengthen homeownership initiatives. These events include homebuyer fairs, seminars and workshops, official proclamations, open houses, and construction and rehabilitation of houses.    The National Partners in Homeownership (of which the Seattle-King County group is a member) is an unprecedented  public-private partnership working to dramatically increase homeownership opportunity in America. Under the directive of President Clinton, the Partnership was formed in 1995 by nearly 60 national organizations that care about homeownership. Today, the Partnership consists of 66 members representing lenders, real estate professionals, home builders, nonprofit housing providers, and federal, state and local governments.     HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said: The good news as we mark National Homeownership Week is that homeownership in America is at record levels. But the bad news we face is that many of HUDs homeownership and other programs are under attack by some members of Congress.  The success of our homeownership initiatives proves that HUD in combination with local organizations can further our goal of even more homeownership and fulfill our commitment to liberty and equity for all.   Linda Murtfeldt, Executive Director of Seattle Habitat for Humanity, said, Volunteers and donors from all walks of life have come together here to build homes and to build hope.  Seattle Habitat for Humanity is proud to be working with so many partners as we together help to build community.   The National Partnerships goal is to achieve a homeownership rate of 67.5 percent of all American households by the end of the year 2000, creating up to eight million additional homeowners since 1995. To reach this ambitious goal, the Partnership has developed a National Homeownership Strategy which proposes 100 specific actions. The National Partners are also working to develop and enhance local homeownership partnerships across the country.    To date, approximately 160 local partnerships have signed on to the National Homeownership Strategy.   Significant strides have been made since the formation of the Partnership. The 1999 homeownership rate reached 66.8 percent-the highest annual rate in American history.

GX047-52-11652358	"TESTIMONY OF THOMAS LAIRD JONES  on behalf of  HABITAT FOR HUMANITY INTERNATIONAL  to the  HOUSING AND COMMUNITY OPPORTUNITY SUBCOMMITTEE  of the  HOUSE BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE  regarding   H.R. 3899 THE AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT   July 23, 1998     Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, Distinguished Members of the Committee, appreciated and hard-working staff, colleagues, and guests:     It is a privilege to testify on behalf of legislation which advances the opportunities for low income persons to achieve the American Dream for homeownership. Habitat for Humanity has two basic goals: To build houses with (not for) persons who in no other way could own their own homes; and to make it a matter of conscience and action world-wide that a simple, decent place to live is an opportunity every person should have. We believe many parts of H.R. 3899 support and advance both of these goals in important ways.    Habitat for Humanity International is an ecumenical Christian organization, now in its 23rd year. Habitat for Humanity is entirely inclusive and non-discriminatory in choosing homeowner partner families, motivating and recruiting volunteers to work with homeowner families, and in every other way. Habitat now has 1447 affiliates in the United States. Each affiliate has 501-(c)-(3) non-profit status and its own locally elected entirely volunteer board of directors. No more than one-fourth of the 1447 affiliates have any paid staff. Habitat is also working in 59 other countries of the world. This fall, Habitat will dedicate its 70,000 house, world-wide.    Truly, Habitat for Humanity is a movement of volunteers representing most every segment of our society. The thread of volunteerism is what makes America great. And Habitat for Humanity manifests diverse volunteerism at its best. You on this Committee, through your active participation in ""The Houses That Congress Built"" this year and last, may now be recognized as Habitat's most famous volunteers! Mr. Chairman, and other distinguished Committee Members, on behalf of the hundreds of families who are coming to homeownership this year as a result of your direct building of ""The Houses That Congress Built"", thank you! To date 375 Members of the House of Representatives are formally committed and building one to five houses each in their own congressional districts. Not only Habitat, but all America appreciates this leadership by ""doing"". We commend you, and we thank you.    Habitat for Humanity builds houses primarily with volunteer labor. It ells the home to the homeowner partner family at no profit and makes a long-term, no interest mortgage with the family at an amount that family can afford. The homeowner partner family is required to do an average of 500 hours sweat equity working on their own home and the homes of others. Usually, homeowner family income is below 50% of median income in the community in which that family resides. After 22 years, the average default rate of Habitat homeowners is less than one percent. A key reason for this is that the relationship developed in building the house together--- homeowner and local volunteers--is continued during the period of the mortgage. In a responsible relationship, people do not let each other down.    The American Homeownership Act is important as a tool to communicate nationally the importance of providing to all persons, regardless of economic standing, the opportunity to own a home. Even more important than this vital symbolism, The American Homeownership Act provides specific creative and necessary actions for significant continuation of programs which work, and for new concepts which will achieve the goal of making homeownership available for more Americans. Habitat for Humanity and similar groups especially support specific parts of this proposed Act, including:    A. Re authorization of the Self-Help Housing Opportunity Program (SHOP) and extension of the time to use funds from two to three years.  In the United States Habitat for Humanity does not accept government funds to build houses. But Habitat does depend on government partnerships for land and infrastructure. SHOP funds can be used only for land and infrastructure. Habitat and other groups using SHOP funds, agree to build one home for every $10,000 of SHOP funds. Thus, government funds become seed money to motivate giving from private sources. In Habitat, this means we raise from private sources three to five times the amount of the government funds used to build each home. But Habitat has learned how vital ""setting the stage"" is. If we can ""set the stage"" --that is, provide land and infrastructure through the use of SHOP funds--the local Habitat affiliates can much more easily raise up the volunteers, the dollars and the gifts-in-kind necessary to build the homes. It is estimated that a minimum of $10,000 of federal funding is required each year to keep families in public rental housing of varying standards. Ten thousand dollars invested through the SHOP program provides a permanent solution for a family, and at the same time allows for homeownership with the many psychological and practical positive results of that---for homeowners and for the communities in which they live.     In the original SHOP legislation in 1996, Habitat was allocated $25 million. Habitat has made contingent approvals to affiliates in all 50 states for the entire amount. This will result in 2700 homes ( 200 more than the 2500 expected).     Mr. Chairman, I would like to highlight one problem which has arisen in the implementation of SHOP. The 1996 authorization bill contains a requirement that organizations use grants within 24 months after disbursement of funds.    We have learned through experience that some Habitat affiliates will not be able to meet this deadline. Volunteers provide their service on a part-time basis and in many cases weather delays, local and state zoning regulations, permit needs, the necessary federally required environmental review process and the like have added considerable time to the pre-construction process. Consequently, Mr. Chairman, we have recommended, and you have included, an extension of the building deadline from 24-36 months. This extension will permit the construction of 2700 homes from the initial grant. Mr. Chairman, we believe this extension should also apply to the FY 1998 and subsequent SHOP appropriations. We encourage the Subcommittee to consider extending the development deadline to 36 months for all SHOP funding.    SHOP appropriations for FY '98 allocate $10 million to Habitat for Humanity. Application kits for these funds were requested by 587 Habitat affiliates in all 50 states. To date, 172 applications requesting $20,166,107 ( for the $10 million available) have been received. This shows the strong need for, and potential of, this successful program.    Because SHOP has been so successful and provides such a good return on he federal contribution, I encourage the committee to consider a multi-year re authorization. With greater certainty about our funding, Habitat can better prepare affiliates to use the federal contributions for maximum housing production.    Mr. Chairman, in writing and passing the original SHOP legislation two years ago, you insured total accountability of Habitat to the Federal Government for the use of all SHOP funds. We are required to report at least annually to the Secretary of HUD and thus to the Congress. I would like to use this opportunity to officially present this annual report to you and your Committee. Attached to the distributed copy of my testimony is a printed summary of this report.     B. Local Capacity Building (Section 4 of Public Law 103-120 (""the HUD Demonstration Act"") .  This program is very important for Habitat for Humanity as it builds capacity for the new century. These funds will be available to Habitat affiliates for hiring staff. Habitat's experience is that the difference in number of units built by affiliates who have no staff and those who have even one staff member is significant. Many of the 75% of the 1447 Habitat affiliates who have no paid staff are applying for these funds to build staffs and to meet other capacity building needs. The funds for staff are available to affiliates on a three year diminishing percentage of the salary, thereby providing affiliates the time and opportunity needed to develop the resources through which staffing can be sustained. Certainly the other three organizations now in this program along with Habitat (Enterprise Foundation, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, and YouthBuild) and the proposed National Association of Housing Partnerships make similar positive and important uses of these funds to provide homeownership opportunities for low-income persons.    C. The ""Homeownership Zone.""  This concept is important for reclaiming distressed neighborhoods. Habitat hopes that this will facilitate the involvement of Habitat and similar non-profit groups with the private and public sectors in joint housing development to achieve homeownership opportunities for low and moderate income families in ways which truly build inclusive neighborhoods.    D. Federal Rental Vouchers.  Habitat for Humanity supports legislation which will allow families to use federal rental vouchers for monthly mortgage payments for homeownership. In other countries Habitat has had good experience with this concept and believes there are many Habitat affiliates who would work to make the concept successful for more low-income families to own their homes.    E. Re authorization of Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation.  Habitat for Humanity and Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation are partners, nationally and locally, in many ways. Habitat supports the re-authorization of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation.    F. Nurturing of Homeowner Families.  One of the core values of Habitat---yea, a secret of the success of Habitat's program---is its emphasis on the counseling/nurturing of Habitat homeowner partner families, from the first contact with Habitat throughout the fifteen to thirty year payoff of the homeowner's mortgage with the local Habitat board. Habitat for Humanity supports all ways which increase the quantity and/or quality of such nurturing.    G. CDBG, HOME and Other Programs.  Habitat for Humanity affiliates in various parts of the country make effective use of CDBG, HOME and other programs which increase opportunities for homeownership by low income families. Habitat supports legislation which increases the effectiveness of such programs.    The review of some of the specifics of this proposed legislation is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather to indicate that the parts of The American Homeownership Act which relate to Habitat for Humanity's approach to homeownership for low-income persons would have positive results for the goals of Habitat for Humanity and for the homeowners and communities with which Habitat works     Mr. Chairman, we in Habitat for Humanity deeply appreciate the leadership of you and your Committee toward making opportunities for homeownership more available for more low income families. We have high expectancy and hope for the future-- that by working together with you and with the other sectors of our society symbolized on these panels here today we can provide a decent place to live through homeownership for all who desire it. The goal to eliminate poverty housing from the face of the earth is right. Together we will persevere until we do that!    We are very hopeful that Congress will act on this legislation this year.

A fter the properties are transferred to SVHH, the City will close on the $100,000 predevelopment loan and secure the loan with a first deed of trust on the largest parcel: S/s of Murphy Ave., between Ringwood and Lundy Avenues.    The deed of trust will be released when the loan is repaid in full, which is anticipated to be upon sale of the six units at Murphy Ave.    No additional outlay of City funds is anticipated for the development of the properties.            B.    Housing Development Budget and Sources of Funds         The total cost to construct each of the homes is estimated to be between $250,000 and $350,000.    For the construction of all twelve homes, the total project cost is estimated to be between $3,250,000 and $4,550,000.    In addition to the City’s $100,000 predevelopment loan, SVHH will finance the costs for the project, including architect and engineering fees, permit fees and materials through cash donations, pro bono services and the volunteers of SVHH.            C.    Financial Analysis and Restricted Expense Levels         The proposed transaction involves the fee transfer by grant deed of City-owned land, which has the following fair market values:         Location                                                                                                                FMV                            SW corner of Murphy Ave. and Ringwood Ave.                                                   $198,000    S/s of Murphy Ave., between Ringwood and Lundy Avenues                     $709,000    S/s of Murphy Ave., between Ringwood Ave. and Lakepark Dr.                           $331,000    Willow St., between Locust St. and Palm St.                                                         $104,000         The fair market values of the first three properties were based on appraisals completed by Carneghi-Bautovich and Partners on March 7, 2002.    The fair market value of the fourth property was determined by an estimate of value completed by the Department of General Services in March 2002 using the Residential Land Value Study for 2002, completed by Diaz, Diaz and Boyd, Inc.                The proposed transaction involves the fee transfer by grant deed of City-owned land, which has a combined fair market value of $1,342,000, for zero dollars.    This transaction is essentially the same as if the City were to be making a grant in the amount of $1,342,000 to the developer for the acquisition of the land.    We can conclude from the analysis completed by Keyser Marston Associates, Inc. that the consideration for the transfer of the City properties without cost is essentially the long-term provision of the affordable units to very low-income households.         Each home will be sold at cost to the homebuyer, which will be at a below market price.    The difference between the sales price and the market price of the home will represent a “market discount” to the homebuyer that will be determined at the time of sale based on market comparables.    If the property is sold at market rate the “market discount” will be repaid to the City under the terms of the Repurchase Option and Covenant Running with Land Agreement to be recorded on the property.              SVHH will maintain a 30-year affordability resale restriction on each of the homes.    This restriction will limit resale of each unit to a very low-income qualified homebuyer at a restricted affordable price.    The City will also record an affordability restriction, for a term of 45 years.    Under the City’s affordability restriction, the seller of any unit will be required to pay a share of equity earned to the City.    Following the expiration of the SVHH’s affordability restriction, i.e., after year 15, an owner may sell to another income-qualified homebuyer at a restricted affordable price, or in the alternative, may sell to a non-qualified buyer.    If the owner sells to a non-qualified buyer, the seller will pay the City the amount of the land value for each of the assisted unit plus an equity share and the City’s affordability restriction will be terminated.    Under the latter scenario, the owner will be able to deduct its “sweat equity” prior to the calculation of the equity share proration.         ANALYSIS         The development of the four sites by SVHH will yield a total of twelve new ownership units for very low-income households.    The City owns all four sites and intends to transfer the sites to SVHH for development. The total project cost for all twelve units is estimated between $3,250,000 and $4,550,000, with a per unit cost of between $250,000 and $350,000.    SVHH depends on donations of land, materials and services and the work of volunteers to minimize the cost of building the home.    SVHH does not earn a profit on any of the homes.    The home is then sold at cost to a very low-income family, which is chosen through SVHH’s selection process.    Buyers must meet certain criteria, including creditworthiness, history of steady income and live in overcrowded and substandard housing conditions.    The families must complete 500 hours of sweat equity in building the home.    The homeowner will pay small monthly, no-interest mortgage payments over a term of 30 years to SVHH.            PUBLIC OUTREACH         It is anticipated that the zoning process for all four properties will require published notices of public hearings before the Planning Commission at which time neighborhood residents may provide input.    SVHH plans to host neighborhood meetings to present their plans for the properties to neighborhood residents.         LEGAL IMPLICATIONS         The subject hearing is required by State Redevelopment Law.    An Option to Repurchase and Convenants Running with the Land Agreement which will include affordability restrictions with a 45-year term will be recorded on the subject property.    One of the units covered by this affordability restriction will serve as a replacement unit for a house located at 367 N. 14 th  Street.    The replacement unit for the house had been allocated to the Las Plumas Warehouse site when the City Council approved the transfer of the property to the Housing Department for the development of affordable housing on October 19, 1999.    Since the property is no longer considered for the development of affordable housing, the replacement unit allocated to the site must be reallocated to a new site.          TIMELINE         Anticipated Transfer of Properties to SVHH                   December 2003                Anticipated Construction Start                            May 2004    Anticipated Construction Completion                  May 2005         COORDINATION         Preparation of this memorandum was coordinated with the Department of Planning, Building and Code Enforcement and the Office of the City Attorney.          COST IMPLICATIONS         Funds to purchase the sites were disbursed from the Housing Department's Fiscal Year 2002-2003 Budget.    This funding is consistent with the Council approved Budget Strategy Memo, adopted on January 31, 2003.          REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA FINDINGS          The following properties are not located within a Redevelopment Project Area:    SW corner of Murphy Ave. and Ringwood Ave; S/s of Murphy Ave., between Ringwood and Lundy Avenues; and S/s of Murphy Ave., between Ringwood Ave. and Lakepark Dr.    Thus, it is required that the City make a finding, on behalf of the Redevelopment Agency, that any such project which utilizes redevelopment funds is a benefit to redevelopment areas.    Since housing for very low- and low-income families and households is identified as vital to support the City’s economic growth, much of what is planned to occur in Downtown and industrial redevelopment project areas, staff recommends that the City Council find that the use of any 20% Low- and Moderate- Income Housing Funds for the Development to be a benefit to these redevelopment project areas.         CEQA         Exempt, PP03-04-128         LESLYE CORSIGLIA    Director of Housing         Attachment
GX038-15-10617115	"press release                       HUD News           HUD No. 99-101   Further Information: For Release   In the Washington, DC area:  202/708-0685 Saturday   Or contact your  local  HUD office June 12, 1999         CUOMO ANNOUNCES CITIES 2000 AGENDA TO BOOST HOMEOWNERSHIP  AND CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN AMERICA'S CITIES     Comments on Raise the Roof Day     Includes Teacher Next Door Initiative    NEW ORLEANS - Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo today announced a four-part Cities 2000 Agenda to increase homeownership and create more affordable housing in America's cities. The Agenda includes a Teacher Next Door Initiative to give public school teachers a 50 percent discount on HUD-owned homes in economically distressed neighborhoods.    ""Working with mayors across this country, we will create more homeowners and more affordable housing in America's cities to attract new residents, increase the tax base, spark economic development and create jobs,"" Cuomo said.  ""The Clinton-Gore economic policies have strengthened America's cities and now is the time to do even more.""          Speaking to the U.S. Conference of  Mayors meeting in New Orleans, Cuomo said the Cities 2000 Agenda will:      Help more teachers become homeowners to help revitalize communities where they work through the new Teacher Next Door Initiative.    Cut HUD's Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance premiums for first-time homebuyers who buy homes in central cities and participate in housing counseling programs.     Increase capital investment in cities and increase the availability of affordable mortgage financing for low- and moderate-income American families.     Mobilize thousands of volunteers around the nation to rehabilitate deteriorated and abandoned housing on Oct. 16, through a new volunteer initiative called Raise The Roof Day.  This will maintain the supply of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families in many cities. (See list of 48 participating cities at end of release).       Cuomo said the four initiatives are part of a drive to reduce the homeownership gap dividing America's cities and suburbs, and to accelerate the revitalization of cities begun under the Clinton-Gore Administration after decades of urban decline.  While 73.5 percent of suburban residents own the homes they live in, only 50.3 percent of urban residents are homeowners.    Here are details on the four initiatives announced by Cuomo:    TEACHER NEXT DOOR       The Teacher Next Door Initiative - to take effect August 1 -  is modeled on HUD's Officer Next Door Initiative, which President Clinton announced in 1997 at the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting.  So far more than 2,700 purchase contracts for HUD-owned homes have been accepted from officers at 50 percent of each home's appraised value.      ""When we help teachers save money on homes in poor neighborhoods, we help revitalize those neighborhoods,"" Cuomo said.  ""The Teacher Next Door Initiative will attract teachers to live and work in urban school districts where they are needed most, and will give them new opportunities to mentor their students outside the classroom.""    Homes offered for sale at half price under both the Teacher Next Door and the Officer Next Door Initiatives were previously insured through FHA and then foreclosed when owners failed to make mortgage payments.  The homes are located in designated revitalization areas.  Revitalization areas are typically in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, have many vacant properties, and often have high crime rates.  They are considered good candidates for economic development and improvement.   About 6,000 of the 40,000 homes nationwide currently owned by FHA are in revitalization areas.   Single-family detached homes, condominiums and townhouses are all eligible for the program.    Neither the Teacher Next Door nor the Officer Next Door Initiatives cost taxpayers any money.  Cost-saving management improvements allow FHA to reduce the price of homes and reduce its mortgage insurance premiums to teachers and officers.  No tax dollars are used to fund FHA programs.   Any public schools teacher who is employed full-time is eligible to purchase a home under the Teacher Next Door Initiative if it is located in a revitalization area within the school district in which the teacher works.  Teachers will be required to live in a home purchased under the initiative for at least three years.    Teachers must use a real estate broker to arrange the sale.  Alternatively, a local government or school district can purchase the house from HUD and then sell it to the teacher.  Teachers can contact their local HUD office for information on the availability of properties in their area.    FHA PREMIUM CUT     The FHA mortgage insurance premium will be cut by a quarter point for first-time homebuyers in central cities who participate in housing counseling, down from 1.75 percent for other first-time homebuyers who participate in the counseling programs.  This will reduce financing costs by $250 on the average FHA-insured mortgage of $100,000.    When coupled with reductions announced earlier, the upfront FHA insurance premium for first-time homebuyers in central cities who receive housing counseling will be 1.25 percent.  The total average reduction in financing costs for qualifying urban homebuyers will be $1,000 since the start of the Clinton-Gore Administration.     Central cities are cities that are the major communities in a metropolitan area.    Cost-saving management improvements will allow FHA to reduce its mortgage insurance premiums, Cuomo said.     To qualify for the premium reduction, prospective first-time homeowners must successfully complete the Homebuyer Education and Learning Program, a 16-hour course that covers such topics as how to select the right house and mortgage, household budgeting, managing credit, and home maintenance and repair.  Homeowners who complete homebuyer counseling programs are less likely to default on their mortgage payments.    FHA insured about 1 million home mortgages in 1998, and has insured about 5.5 million home mortgages since 1993.  Without FHA insurance, many families would be unable to get mortgages to become homeowners.    PUBLIC-PRIVATE INITIATIVE TO INCREASE COMMUNITY INVESTMENT CAPITAL FOR U.S. CITIES     FHA and the Federal Home Loan Bank announced an agreement to work together in a new partnership to increase the capital investment in cities and to increase the availability of affordable mortgage financing for low- and moderate-income American families.  The initiative is expected to stimulate millions of dollars in new mortgage loans by private lenders.      The New England Region is the first area of the nation to participate in this effort.  The Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston signed an agreement with HUD this week to launch the demonstration program for the banks it services in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island and Connecticut.    Under the  initiative, lenders and FHA will work to streamline and speed up the handling of applications for mortgages and mortgage insurance by developers who want to build or rehabilitate affordable apartment projects with 5 to 50 units.  Currently, many developers of these small projects find the process of applying for mortgages and FHA insurance too costly and time-consuming.  In addition, many lenders have focused on providing mortgages to larger apartment projects.   Under the initiative, banks will also launch marketing and outreach efforts to reach potential small apartment developers and will train their staffs to work with such developers and help them access HUD programs.       RAISE THE ROOF DAY    Raise The Roof Day is an effort to mobilize thousands of volunteers around the country on Oct. 16 to rehabilitate deteriorated and abandoned houses and apartments to maintain the supply of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income income families.     HUD will bring together national and local non-profit groups, faith-based organizations and local governments to recruit and work with the volunteers.  Groups already signed up for the project include:  Habitat for Humanity, Christmas in April, the Enterprise Foundation, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, and YouthBuild USA.  So far 48 mayors have agreed to have their city governments work in partnership with local groups to carry out projects in their cities.    ""Raise The Roof Day aims to help recycle the aging and run-down homes of the past and turn them into homes for the future,"" Cuomo said.     Raise The Roof Day is also designed to increase public awareness about the need for affordable housing and highlight the ongoing good work of groups and local governments.    Mayors in the following cities have agreed to promote Raise The Roof Day:           Albuquerque, NM     Hartford, CT     Salt Lake City, UT           Anchorage, AK     Honolulu, HI     Santa Ana, CA           Atlanta, GA     Jacksonville, FL     San Antonio, TX           Bangor, ME     Kansas City, KS     San Buenaventura, CA           Birmingham, AL     Knoxville, TN     San Juan, PR           Boise, ID     Little Rock, AR     Santa Fe, NM           Boston, MA     Los Angeles, CA     Seattle, WA           Burlington, VT     Louisville, KY     Shreveport, LA           Casper, WY     Manchester, NH     Springfield, IL           Cincinnati, OH     Milwaukee, WI     St. Louis, MO           Dallas, TX     Minneapolis, MN     Tampa, FL           Denver, CO     New Orleans, LA     Tucson, AR           Des Moines, IA     Omaha, NE     Tulsa, OK           Flint, MI     Phoenix, AZ     Wilmington, DE           Fort Worth, TX     Portland, Ore.           Grand Rapids, MI     Reno, NV           Greensboro, NC     Richmond, VA           COMMENTS ON RAISE THE ROOF DAY     Tom Jones, Managing Director, Habitat for Humanity International  - ""We are grateful for Raise The Roof Day and its focus: to bring more persons to a deeper commitment to making a decent place to live a reality for every single human being. Habitat for Humanity International will urge all of its 1,490 affiliates in the United States to participate in ""Raise the Roof Day"" and will be supportive in other ways as well.""     Dorothy Stoneman, President, YouthBuild U.S.A.  - ""Young people in low-income communities are eager to be active partners in rebuilding their neighborhoods, transforming abandoned shells into beautiful new homes for all who need them.  Raise The Roof Day will give YouthBuild trainees in many cities a wonderful chance to work with public and private partners.""    Patricia Riley Johnson, President & CEO, Christmas in April U.S.A.  - ""Christmas in April, as one of the leading volunteer rehabilitation program in America, applauds HUD's initiative to bring new awareness to and involvement in assuring all families a safe and decent homewe will together, make a real difference in revitalizing our communities.""    Bart Harvey, Chairman and CEO of The Enterprise Foundation  - ""Despair does not move people or motivate them to get involved.  Results do.  Enterprise is proud to partner with HUD on a project that will demonstrate results and the commitments that make them happen.""    Michael Rubinger, President and CEO of Local Initiatives Support Corporation  -  ""Across the country, in hard-pressed urban and rural neighborhoods, every day is Raise The Roof Day for thousands of local community developersnational Raise The Roof Day will underscore not only the tremendous need for quality affordable housing, but also the tremendous potential that exists in these communities."""

The fourteen committees issued eleven reports. The committees on the Napa County Jail/Juvenile Hall, Response and Complaint committees elected, with approval from the full Grand Jury, not to make reports. Complaints were looked into by the Complaint committee and, if that committee found it appropriate, a committee was appointed to look into the subject matter of the complaint, or the complaint was referred to an existing committee. There were 23 complaints looked into by the Complaint committee. The full Grand Jury acted on each complaint. Some were deemed unworthy of any investigation and dropped. Others were looked into and dropped and others were assigned to existing committees. The City Building Department committee was appointed to look into several citizen complaints. This years Grand Jury elected to look mostly into matters of concern to the community rather than the agencies selected for review by the matrix found in the Napa County Grand Jury Procedures Manual 2001-2002. The Special Needs Housing committee looked into the community's response to the homeless problem, the Sullivan Shelter, the Winter Shelter, Samaritan Shelter and the Hope Center. The review of Napa  Vallejo Waste Management Authority was conducted by a joint committee of the Napa and Solano County Grand Juries, a first for Napa County. Agricultural Pesticides, the Napa River Flood Control Project, County Planning, and the litigation over the Airport Specific Plan were all subjects posing problems for the community that have been reported in the media. The Napa County Fire Department was selected from the matrix. The committee on the City of Napa Building Department was appointed as a result of a citizen's complaint and the same committee looked at City of Napa Code Enforcement as the two seemed intertwined at the time the committee was appointed. It is required that the Grand Jury look at the Napa County Jail and Juvenile Hall and the Auditor each year. A committee was appointed to look into the manner in which the funds raised by Measure Y and Proposition 1A were spent by the Napa Valley Unified School District. It also looked at maintenance and deterioration of some of the physical facilities of some of the schools in the District.   FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS SELECTED FOR SPECIAL EMPHASIS 1. The Sullivan Shelter must be replaced. Fulfillment of Napa's Master Plan will require moving the downtown single adult shelter which is presently using a condemned county building. The replacement of this shelter with a larger permanent shelter is priority #1. 2. The Family Shelter (Samaritan House) on Old Sonoma Road will accommodate seven (7) families at a time. Many families with children on the waiting list for Samaritan House are housed in local motels at taxpayers' expense. The expansion of Samaritan Shelter, or the development of additional family shelters, is priority #2. 3. Napa County's Board of Supervisors and its responsible agencies need to urgently address the issues raised by the invalidity of the Housing Element and the General Plan. The County has hard choices to make regarding growth, development and housing and it is up to the elected officials to take stands and make policy rather than maintain their current ""wait and see"" attitude. 4. The County Board of Supervisors and its Planning Commission and Planning Staff, and the various City Councils, and their Planning Commissions and staff should make every effort to accommodate applications for relocation of businesses closed by the Flood Control Project, including but not limited to giving priority to such applications over other applications. 5. Napa County Fire Department has administrative and budgetary issues which need to be addressed by the Board of Supervisors.   FUNCTION OF THE GRAND JURY THE GRAND JURY The primary function of the Grand Jury is to examine all areas of local government: county, city and special districts (including school districts). The 19-member ""civil"" Grand Jury in Napa County conducts non-criminal investigations to ensure that government funds are judiciously used, that services are effectively delivered, and that all accounts are properly audited. The Grand Jury is an independent and confidential body. The Presiding Judge of the Superior Court, the District Attorney, the County Counsel and the State Attorney General can, and do, provide advice, but they may not, except for legal cause, prevent the body from acting within its jurisdiction. A county Grand Jury does not have jurisdiction in state and federal matters. There are state and federal grand juries impaneled at those respective levels. Consequently, the Napa County Grand Jury cannot investigate state or federal agencies. Nor does it have any jurisdiction over the courts or a matter in litigation. But, in general, governmental bodies within Napa County, and events involving those agencies, can be investigated by the Grand Jury. Grand Jurors are expected to be fair, to show sound judgment, to maintain absolute confidentiality, and to serve as representatives of the public. Therefore, the Grand Jury is not the forum from which to express narrow political ideals or viewpoints, but is, rather, the organization that seeks to better the government that presently exists. Members are selected from among Napa County residents. Beginning in 1993, all residents were offered an opportunity to volunteer. Judges and friends of the court can also nominate county residents. Up to ten members, in their initial term of service, may volunteer to hold over for one additional year. Each Grand Jury is impaneled for one year, from July through the following June. Napa County residents who are interested in serving as Grand Jurors are encouraged to apply. To be considered, an applicant must:       Be a citizen of the United States Be at least 18 years of age Have resided in Napa County for at least one year immediately prior to being selected Have ordinary intelligence and good character Possess a working knowledge of the English language Not be presently serving as a trial juror       Not have been a Grand Juror within one year of being selected (except holdovers) Not have been convicted of a felony or malfeasance in office Not be presently serving as an elected official  Interested citizens should write to the Superior Court, Napa County, Suite 125, 825 Brown Street, Napa 94559, or call 253-4481, Ext 202 to volunteer or nominate someone. The Grand Jury is an arm of the court system. It is not a part of the District Attorney's Office, nor is it a law enforcement agency. For the most part Grand Juries function as ""civil"" grand juries rather than criminal grand juries. This is because preliminary hearings in the Courts have, for the most part, taken the place of criminal indictments by grand juries. In the federal system the rule is the opposite because the United States Constitution requires grand jury indictments for all serious federal crimes. A ""civil"" grand jury has very limited powers. The California Supreme Court has held that the Grand Jury does not have inherent powers to establish its own investigatory apparatus for the detection of crime. Moreover, a ""civil"" grand jury should not engage in ""fishing expeditions"", ""hidden agendas"" or indiscriminate meddling. The scope of inquiry of a civil grand jury is limited to those subjects that are founded upon knowledge, which comes to the Grand Jury, not by rumors and reports, but by information acquired from evidence before the civil grand jury or from individual grand jurors' own observations. For the most part civil grand jurors are charged with investigating the ""operations, accounts, and records"" of the officers and departments of local government and the ""method or system of performing the duties"" those officers and departments employ. A ""civil"" grand jury makes investigations and reports on those civil investigations to the general public after the reports have been reviewed and approved for release by the court. Although approval of the courts precedes the release of the Final Report, the courts do not have the right to require changes to the grand jury reports. The reports are usually issued in the form of a Final Report that is published at the end of the Grand Jury's year of service. In extraordinary circumstances, the civil grand jury can become a participant in the legal process to remove from office or indict a government official, but any such action initiated by a grand jury must be based on facts substantiated and confirmed by the Grand Jury's own investigation. The Grand Jury can take no action based solely on allegations of other parties. California law provides for civil and criminal functions for grand juries. While a ""civil"" grand jury can also function as a criminal grand jury, it is   unlikely that would occur. Were a criminal matter to be taken up by the Grand Jury at the request of the District Attorney, it is likely that a separate grand jury would be convened for that purpose. THE 2001-2002 NAPA COUNTY GRAND JURY The current Grand Jury met regularly during the year every other Wednesday evening. Most of the members served on at least three committees. The majority of their time was spent in individual committee meetings and in conducting field investigations, which usually were performed both during normal business hours and, when appropriate, at night. HOW INVESTIGATIONS ARE CONDUCTED Jurors initially meet with the management and staff of an agency. The various records of the agency are inspected, the physical facilities are inspected, and representative public meetings, if any, are attended. Leads are followed which might provide additional information. Eventually, proposed ""findings"" and ""recommendations"" are developed. CITIZEN COMPLAINTS AND LETTERS TO THE GRAND JURY Each year correspondence is received from citizens expressing concern or requesting investigation of various city agencies, county agencies and special districts. Each complaint is reviewed by the Grand Jury and action is taken to either (1) investigate the matter and make a report; (2) investigate the matter and drop it; or (3) drop the matter without investigation. It is best to submit any complaint or request at the beginning of the jury term so that the Grand Jury will have sufficient time to investigate the matter. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE FINAL REPORT IS PUBLISHED Copies of the Grand Jury Final Report are maintained on file in the office of the Court Executive Officer and the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors, where they remain accessible to the public. Final Reports are also available at county libraries and are published in the newspapers. Agencies that are required to make responses must respond in writing to the Presiding Judge of the Superior Court of California, Napa County, within 60 to 90 days after publication of the Report. The responses must be placed on file with the clerk of the investigated agency and at the office of the Court Executive Officer and may be accessed by the public at those locations.   NOTE TO RESPONDENTS GENERAL The legal requirements for response to Grand Jury findings and recommendations are set forth in California Penal Code, Section 933.05. Each Respondent should become familiar with those legal requirements and if in doubt should consult with legal counsel before responding. For the assistance of Respondents, Section 933.05 of the Penal Code is summarized below: HOW TO RESPOND TO FINDINGS The responding person or entity must respond in one of two ways: 1. That there is agreement with the finding. 2. That there is disagreement, wholly or partially, with the finding. In such a case, the response shall specify the portion of the finding that is disputed and shall include an explanation of the reasons for the disagreement. HOW TO REPORT ACTION IN RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations by the Grand Jury require action. The responding person or entity must report action on each recommendation in one of four ways: 1. The recommendation has been implemented, with a summary of the implemented action. 2. The recommendation has not been implemented, but will be implemented in the future, with a time frame for implementation. 3. The recommendation requires further analysis. If a Respondent replies in this manner, the law requires a detailed explanation of the analysis or study and a time frame not to exceed six months from the date of publication of the Grand Jury Final Report by which the recommendation will be discussed. 4. The recommendation will not be implemented because it is not warranted or is not reasonable, with an explanation as to why it is not warranted or reasonable.   BUDGETARY OR PERSONNEL RECOMMENDATIONS If a finding or recommendation deals with budgetary or personnel matters of a county department headed by an elected officer, both the elected officer and the Board of Supervisors shall respond, if the Grand Jury so requests. While the response of the Board of Supervisors may be somewhat limited, the response by the department head must address all aspects of the findings and recommendations. ADVANCE RELEASE OF GRAND JURY REPORT DISCLOSURE PROHIBITED PRIOR TO PUBLIC RELEASE Two working days prior to public release of the Final Report, the Grand Jury is required to provide a copy of the pertinent portion of the report to each affected agency or person. No officer, agency, department, or governing body of a public agency shall disclose any contents of the report prior to its public release. TIME TO RESPOND; TO WHOM TO RESPOND The Penal Code provides for two different response methods: 1. For a Public Agency: The governing body (i.e. the Board of Supervisors, a City Council, Board of Governors of a special district, etc.) of the public agency must respond within ninety days after public release of the Final Report. The response must be addressed to the Presiding Judge of the Superior Court. 2. For an Elected Officer or an Agency Head: All elected officers or heads of agencies who are required to respond must do so within sixty days after public release of the Final Report. The response must be addressed to the Presiding Judge of the Superior Court, with an information copy to the Board of Supervisors.   AIRPORT SPECIFIC PLAN  NAPA COUNTY In July 2001, the Grand Jury determined to look into the litigation over the 1998 Airport Industrial Area Specific Plan (the ""1998 Plan"") between ""The Petitioners"" (Citizens for Honest Government, Sierra Club and the City of American Canyon) and the County of Napa in an attempt to determine the reasons for the lawsuit and the ultimate result. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS Finding 1 The Grand Jury finds it repugnant that an entity of Napa County sued the County itself. The taxpayers of the County and of American Canyon funded this litigation; American Canyon residents were taxed twice, both as citizens of the City and citizens of the County. Both bodies should have instructed staff to meet and consult until the need for litigation was resolved. The Napa County Board of Supervisors (""the Board"") and the American Canyon City Council (""the Council"") should have given way to the common good. Finding 2 The Board seem to be content to operate on a ""status quo"" basis with an invalid Housing Element, an invalid General Plan, and an invalid 1998 Airport Specific Plan (see October 26, 1992 letter from Deputy Director of Department of Housing and Community Development in Attachment). BACKGROUND The participants in this lawsuit seem to have had various reasons for filing suit. Citizens for Honest Government was a small organization unhappy with the Napa County Board of Supervisors; the Sierra Club was concerned about environmental issues near the Airport; and the City of American Canyon was embroiled in a long-standing dispute with Napa County. This dispute arose as a result of the incorporation of American Canyon in the early 1990's. When the City incorporated, it resulted in a net loss of revenue to the County's tax base. The incorporation greatly reduced Napa County's intended new housing base which was part of the Housing Element of the 1983 General Plan as amended in 1986. The County had planned to authorize the construction of new houses in south Napa County to meet its state and regional obligations for housing, including low-cost housing. American Canyon's incorporation resulted in a loss of new housing area to meet the County's housing obligation.   Throughout the years following the incorporation, there had been additional skirmishes between American Canyon and Napa County. American Canyon has been unable to obtain a Rural-Urban Limit for growth purposes. There has been little cooperation from the County in responding to legitimate requests from American Canyon. The City's joining in the suit against the County regarding the Airport plan was a further attempt to get the County's attention. In 1999, the Napa Superior Court (the ""NSC"") ruled that the County's 1998 Airport Industrial Area Specific Plan (the ""Plan"") was invalid because the Environmental Impact Report (the ""EIR"") that had been prepared to assess the Plan's impact was deficient in its consideration of the Plan's impacts after buildout upon traffic, housing and steelhead trout. The 1998 Plan was an updated version of the County's 1986 Plan for the airport area, with more specific and comprehensive ""industrial park"" design, improvement and density standards. The NSC also held that the 1986 Plan, which the 1998 Plan superceded, remained valid and that the County could continue to process and approve projects in the airport area which complied with the earlier standards, while the County worked to correct deficiencies in the 1998 Plan and its EIR. This latter portion of the NSC's decision was not appealed. The County appealed the invalidation of the Plan. The appeals court in San Francisco (the ""Court"") in a published opinion, affirmed the NSC's decision. The County asked the Court to reconsider its decision and was denied. The California Supreme Court declined to hear the County's appeal. Several significant issues of ""first impression,"" not previously ruled upon in California environmental law, were decided by the Court. First, the County could properly decide to delete certain traffic mitigation measures adopted as part of the 1986 Plan, which the passage of time proved were infeasible. The 1986 Plan called for traffic interchanges to be build at the intersection of highways 29 and 221 at the south end of the Southern Crossing bridge and at the intersection of highways 29 and 12 at Airport Boulevard and Jamison Canyon Road. The 1998 Plan deleted these improvements as a required element of Plan buildout because: (1) the contribution of project traffic to congestion problems caused by other traffic using these roadways was ""minor""; (2) the County lacked the funds to implement these very costly improvements (perhaps $70 million); and, (3) the County did not control the design, approval and construction of these State highway improvements; Caltrans did. These were legitimate reasons for County to conclude these improvements were ""infeasible."" Evidence supported these reasons. Changed circumstances over time allow a county to delete or modify project mitigation measures previously adopted. They are not cast in stone. Mitigation measures to minimize significant environmental effects, such as traffic, are ""infeasible"" if   they cannot be accomplished within a reasonable time, taking into account economic, environmental, social and technological factors. Secondly, the Court concluded that the 1998 Plan EIR adequately identified traffic impacts from the airport industrial area and mitigation measures, even though the only mitigation it required was funding an area traffic study, not funding the actual improvements if the study concluded they were necessary. Mitigation measures must be roughly proportional to the impacts of a project. Since there was evidence that project traffic impacts were a ""minor"" contributor to area traffic problems, funding the costly improvements was not proportional and therefore did not require mitigation. The County will continue to impose a traffic mitigation fee on plans for area development, which so far has raised more than $2 million for internal roadway improvements. Third, the Court held that the EIR contained an adequate discussion of housing impacts and mitigation, but that its discussion of significant impacts due to water availability and wastewater treatment was not adequate. Since preparation of the EIR American Canyon has constructed its own sewer plant and there is capacity to service the Plan area (American Canyon south of Fagan Creek and Napa Sanitation District north of Fagan Creek). American Canyon has also contracted with Vallejo for extra water and, according to the Napa Flood Control and Water Conservation District, is in good shape for both short and long-term water supply. Finally, the EIR failed to adequately consider project impacts on steelhead trout in the Napa River. The County unwisely elected not to amend the Plan EIR to discuss this and incorporate necessary mitigation (stream setbacks, riparian cover, prevention of siltation/sedimentation). Aside from finding these deficiencies in the EIR, the Court also held that the 1998 Plan was invalid because it was in conflict with the County's General Plan. The General Plan is the highest and most authoritative document in the hierarchy of County plans and ordinances. All specific plans or zoning ordinances are subordinate to it and must be consistent with the dictates of the General Plan. What is particularly significant about the Court's ruling is that the 1998 Plan was inconsistent because it frustrated the general ""Goals"" of reducing congestion and implementing a comprehensive circulation system set forth in the General Plan. The County argued these Goals were advisory only, but the Court concluded they were mandatory. The Court found the 1998 Plan failed to implement these Goals, contained no specific improvements to reduce congestion and to handle the increase in traffic from the project area without increasing congestion. This will be a challenge to the County, since it has concluded it lacks the funds and authority to make congestion-reducing improvements on adjacent State highways 221, 29 and 12. It may be that the   County will have to amend its General Plan Goals to recognize this reality before it can approve a ""consistent"" Specific Plan for the airport area. The Court also concluded any new Specific Plan must include affirmative steps to mitigate project impacts on housing and growth in order to be consistent with the General Plan. The result of the decision is that no pending projects may be approved under the 1998 Plan, as it is invalid and will remain so until properly adopted after certification of an adequate EIR. Processing of all project applications in the airport area by the County under the 1998 Plan have been processed under the 1986 plan. Each project must comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and several are required to prepare their own EIRs. The 1986 Plan remains valid and in force. There appears to be a lack of concern by the Napa County Board of Supervisors regarding the invalidity of the 1998 Plan, the invalidity of the General Plan, and, most importantly, the invalidity of the Housing Element of the General Plan. The monies spent on the 1998 Airport Specific Plan appear to be largely wasted. It appears to the Grand Jury that the resolution of the Housing Element has the highest priority. If the General Plan is to be updated, the Airport Specific Plan can be part of the General Plan update. Because of the invalidity of the Housing Element, and the General Plan and the Court's determination of the invalidity of the Airport Specific Plan, property rights of owners county-wide are in great jeopardy. The Grand Jury is informed that a court could prohibit all building permits in the county until a lawful Housing Element of the General Plan is adopted and the General Plan is updated. The Grand Jury determined that the City of American Canyon spent $173,000 on attorney's fees and that the County of Napa spent over $380,000 on attorney's fees and consultants on the litigation in addition to the substantial cost of preparation of the 1998 Airport Specific Plan The Grand Jury is unable to determine the cost of lost staff time for either entity. PROCEDURES The Grand Jury interviewed members of the Napa County Board of Supervisors, members of the American Canyon City Council, members of Citizens for Honest Government, the Napa County Planning Director and staff, the American Canyon City Manager, Napa City Council members and members of the public. Finding 1 The Grand Jury finds it repugnant that an entity of Napa County sued the County itself. The taxpayers of the County and of American Canyon funded this litigation; American Canyon residents were taxed twice, both as   citizens of instructed Individual way to the  the City and citizens of the County. Both bodies should have staff to meet and consult until the need for litigation was resolved. personalities on both the Board and the Council should have given common good.  Recommendation 1 Future litigation between the County and its cities or other governmental bodies should be avoided at almost any cost. In the future, staff should be directed to find a solution short of litigation. Mediation between the staff of the County and the staff of the City should be required before resorting to litigation. Response Requested from American Canyon City Council Board of Supervisors County Executive Officer County Planning Director Finding 2 The Napa County Board of Supervisors seem to be content to operate on a ""status quo"" basis with an invalid Housing Element, an invalid General Plan, and an invalid 1998 Airport Specific Plan. Recommendation 2 Napa County's Board of Supervisors and its responsible agencies need to urgently address the issues raised by the invalidity of the Housing Element, and the invalidity of the General Plan. The County has hard choices to make regarding growth, development and housing and it is up to the elected officials to take stands and make policy rather than maintain their current ""wait and see"" attitude. Response Requested from Board of Supervisors County Executive Officer County Planning Director   AGRICULTURAL PESTICIDES - NAPA COUNTY The Grand Jury reviewed agricultural pesticide use and regulation in Napa County. This included the following:      Monitoring proper use, storage and application procedures by licensed commercial pesticide users; Enforcement of regulations required by local, State and Federal laws, and the penalties imposed for violations; Pesticide exposure risk data - worker and public health issues; Effects on the Napa County watersheds  ground water, streams, water reservoirs and the Napa River; and Efforts to publicly educate farmers, agricultural workers, and our citizenry regarding pesticide risk issues including information on alternatives to traditional pesticide use  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 1. The Grand Jury found no evidence of any significant, repetitive or extensive violation of agricultural pesticide use in the county. Where appropriate, it appears that violators have been assessed warnings, penalties and/or fines and corrected their misuse. 2. The Agricultural Commissioner has created a Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter (GWSS) task force of citizen activists and experts and created a GWSS work plan for Napa County. The Grand Jury commends the Napa County Agricultural Commissioner for his leadership. 3. ""Sustainable Agriculture"" practices have helped result in a reduction of traditional chemical pesticide use in Napa County of 10% from the prior year. Pesticide use has dropped in Napa County in 2000 for the third straight year. 4. Watershed testing by the State for ground and surface water has shown undetectable levels of pesticides. Local agencies are not performing water testing required by State agencies. 5. The Offices of the Agricultural Commissioner, the Department of Environmental Management and Public Health are watching for and have found no reported cases of any serious pesticide related health issues in Napa County. There are no studies or data to indicate a clustering of cancer or higher incidences of cancer in agricultural areas of the county or among agricultural workers.   BACKGROUND The California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) and Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations provide guidelines for local agencies on pesticide licensing, reporting and use. Local agencies involved in pesticide regulation and safety include the Napa County Agricultural Commissioner's Office, the Department of Environmental Management and the Public Health Department. Agricultural pesticide use can be the single greatest contributor to water pollution and air pollution in many rural counties. Concern regarding pesticide use has risen once it was understood that these toxins can have effects on health and the environment well beyond their intended use against pests. Potential public health and environmental consequences of traditional agricultural practices can include:    Contamination of ground water and the watershed by hazardous materials; Air pollution from pesticide drift, waste burning, and machinery exhaust fumes; Human health risks such as cancer, reproductive and neurological toxicity, and other acute and chronic illnesses such as allergic reactions and skin sensitivity associated with the use of pesticides on farmlands; Wildlife loss due to habitat destruction and toxic effects on birds, fish, bees and other beneficial organisms; and Degraded soils from over cultivation, excessive use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, soil erosion from hillside vineyard development, and neglect of the proper balance of microbial and organic matter needed to maintain healthy soil.     Heightened public awareness of pesticide effects is appropriate: nearly 25% of pesticide applied in agriculture in the U.S. is applied in California. In addition, pesticide exposure is not just confined to our agricultural areas; pesticides are also used in and around homes, yards, buildings, stores, schools, parks, and other public settings. Persons most susceptible to unwanted toxic effects of pesticides are among the most vulnerable in Napa County: farm workers, children, the homeless, the elderly and ill. The Napa County Agricultural Commissioner (AC) supervises a staff of 22 regular employees and some additional seasonal employees. The Commissioner and his staff are responsible for the implementation of Federal, State and local regulatory agricultural programs within Napa County. Specifically, these programs are designed to both protect citizens and our   environment as well as to promote agriculture within Napa County. The challenge for the AC is to balance these goals, which can be at odds with each other. The AC licenses local professional pesticide dealers, advisors and applicators. The AC investigates all reports of pesticide related illness or injuries, relying on the county Public Health Staff and local health care providers to report these occurrences. The AC also enforces some regulations to protect ground and surface water from pesticide contamination. The AC Office performs random field inspections using staff biologists primarily during the dormant growth season. Three or four inspectors examine pesticide storage sites, review vineyard managers' records regarding worker safety programs and pesticide use, and attempt to keep farmers abreast of current State and Federal requirements for worker safety and pesticide use. The AC states that within a 4-year period, all licensed users of pesticides in Napa County are reviewed. Warnings and/or fines are imposed on violators. The maximum penalty is $700 per violation. The Grand Jury reviewed records of penalties imposed by the AC Office over the past three years. PROCEDURES 1) The Grand Jury interviewed the following officials, agencies and citizens in Napa County:    A large scale organic vineyard manager using Sustainable Agricultural techniques A large scale vineyard manager using conventional techniques A citizen member of POISON (People Opposed to Insecticide Spraying on Neighborhoods) who is also on the Napa Agricultural Commissioner's Special Advisory Committee on Alternatives to Pesticide use A citizen on the Napa Watershed Task Force The County Agricultural Commissioner The County Director of Environmental Management The County Public Health Officer A medical director and several health care providers from health care clinics that serve agricultural field workers        2) The Grand Jury reviewed the following published data and reports regarding pesticides:  Water testing in Napa County by local, State and Federal agencies for chemicals and pesticides over the past 12 years;            Penalties imposed by the Napa Agricultural Commissioner's Office for misuse of hazardous materials over the past 3 years; POISON Manual 2001 (People Opposed to Insecticide Spraying on Neighborhoods) - a collection of citizen activist papers on pesticide use; Roots of Change: Agriculture, Ecology and Health in California  published by the Funders Agricultural Working Group in San Francisco, CA (March 2001) - a report on Sustainable Agriculture in California; Pesticides and Human Health  resource for health care professionals  published by Physicians for Social Responsibility and Californians for Pesticide Reform (1999) - data and positions by health care professionals; Time For a Change: Pesticides and Wine Grapes in Sonoma and Napa Counties  published by Californians for Alternatives to Toxics (1997)  data and positions by citizens; and Cancer statistics for Napa County and California - published by American Cancer Society (2000) and additional data from Napa County Public Health Office.  3) Grand Jury committee members attended a Napa Valley Vintner's Association Conference with presentations on Sustainable Agriculture research and the use of alternatives to traditional pesticides in Napa County. 4) Grand Jury committee members reviewed past Grand Jury Reports on the Napa County Agricultural Commissioner's Office. Finding 1 The Grand Jury found no evidence of any significant, repetitive or extensive violation of agricultural pesticide use in the county. Where appropriate, it appears that violators have been assessed warnings, penalties and/or fines and corrected their misuse. Recommendation 1 The Napa County Agricultural Commissioner's Office should remain vigilant and continue to vigorously investigate violations of pesticide regulations as detected. The current system of inspection every four years should not be routine and should be done more frequently. Penalties for repeat or large-scale violations should be greater than $700 fines.   Response Requested From Napa County Agricultural Commissioner Napa County Board of Supervisors Finding 2 Other counties in California have had devastating agricultural problems with the introduction of the Glassy-winged Sharpshooter (GWSS) as a vector for Pierce's Disease in certain crops. At this time, there is no evidence of GWSS infestation in Napa County. While there are other pests that have already introduced Pierce's Disease into Napa County, the introduction of the GWSS would create an exponentially more serious problem. The AC and staff created the current GWSS work plan. The GWSS work plan for Napa County has evolved following much citizen task force input. Initially, some citizen groups felt that the work plan was premature and unsatisfactory, in that it did not adequately include options for using alternatives to traditional pesticides. What has resulted is a work plan that offers property owners options of traditional or alternative pesticides in the event of an infestation. The Grand Jury review found that the Napa County Agricultural Commissioner is knowledgeable and responsive to community concerns regarding agricultural pesticide issues. He continues to regularly meet with several citizen and vintner groups on this matter. He appears to be one of the leaders in the State on the GWSS issue. There has been a continuing attempt by the AC to educate the general public, vintners, agricultural workers, and health care providers on this topic. COMMENDATION The Grand Jury commends the Napa County Agricultural Commissioner for his leadership on the GWSS issue and his efforts at appointing qualified Napa County citizens to task forces on this important pesticide related matter. Finding 3 Traditional agricultural practices involving the application of toxic chemicals to soil can lead to cumulative chemical effects that contaminate the environment, threaten human health and compromise ecosystems. There is a growing trend among some County farmers that is resulting in a movement away from traditional chemical pesticides and towards a safer pest management approach. This concept of ""Sustainable Agriculture"" can provide agricultural product in a profitable way without creating pollution or risks to human health or environment.   Sustainable Agriculture is ""an integrated system of plant production practices that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs"" according to the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program at the University of California, Davis. This Program was created in 1986 by CA legislature in response to concern about:     Protecting human health and wildlife in rural communities; The environmental impacts of traditional agricultural techniques; Profitability and success of small and family farming operations; and Ensuring abundant, affordable and healthy farming product.  Recommendation 3 The AC Office should take the lead in encouraging Napa County farmers to learn about and implement Sustainable Agricultural concepts and techniques. Research and data available suggest that Sustainable Agricultural techniques are an important means towards prevention of the adverse effects of traditional chemical pesticides and fertilizers, while still operating profitable and productive farms. Sustainable Agriculture should be one of the subjects for the Public Awareness Week in Recommendation #4. Response Requested From Napa County Agricultural Commissioner Napa County Board of Supervisors Finding 4 Last year, more than 2,120,000 pounds of pesticide were used in Napa County, which ranked 22nd highest in pesticide use out of California's 58 counties. This represents a 10% decrease from the prior year. This is the third straight year that Napa County has experienced decreased conventional agricultural pesticide use. Three of the top five most-used pesticides or herbicides in Napa County: sulfur, glyphosate salt and copper hydroxide, are considered relatively safe to humans. The most commonly used chemical is elemental sulfur, which many believe is relatively safe for human contact and the environment. In fact, elemental sulfur is authorized for use by certified organic farmers. However, some observers still feel that there may be long-term health risks even with elemental sulfur use.   Two others in the top five, methyl bromide and simazine, are among chemicals that most concern citizen activists:  Methyl bromide is a soil sterilant in gas form used prior to planting. It has been associated with human birth defects at low doses, and its use is closely regulated under the terms of Proposition 65: the State's Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1984. Simazine is a common herbicide used on grapes. It is categorized as a possible human carcinogen and endocrine disrupting chemical. It is a frequent ground water contaminant throughout the U.S.    Some vineyard managers believe that most of the useful information on effective pesticide or herbicide choices comes from local dealers, marketing agents or word of mouth from other vineyard managers, rather than from our local government agencies. Recommendation 4 The Grand Jury acknowledges and applauds County farmers' efforts at reducing traditional pesticide and herbicide use. The Department of Environmental Management and The Office of the Agriculture Commissioner should consider a ""Public Awareness Week"" for increased dissemination of information regarding pesticide, health and clean water issues in Napa County. The Napa Board of Supervisors needs to be kept abreast of recent changes in State and Federal laws regarding use and monitoring of pesticides in our county. Response Requested From Napa Napa Napa Napa County County County County Agricultural Commissioner Director of Environmental Management Public Health Officer Board of Supervisors  Finding 5 Watershed testing for ground and surface water contamination in Napa County done by State agencies over the past twelve years has shown undetectable levels of pesticide or herbicide. These tests are done on a random, unscheduled basis throughout high-risk areas in the county. State requirements vary from one time testing, annual testing or every three-year testing, depending on the chemical. Water is also tested for other   contaminants, including pathogens, nutrients and sediment by these random tests. Currently the Department of Environmental Management (DEM) receives State funds of $26,000 per year plus additional tax revenues from local water districts for implementing these environmental health and safety regulations. However, neither DEM nor any other local Napa County agency is testing ground or river water for pesticide contamination at this time. According to the Director, this is in part due to DEM staffing shortages over the past several years. The State may take over the required testing in Napa County if DEM does not comply, and DEM could lose State and water district revenues for this testing. Currently, neither Sonoma nor Solano County agencies are doing local ground water testing; it is being done by the State. Recommendation 5 Napa County DEM should comply with State requirements for chemical contaminant testing in ground and surface water at this time, and make use of the funds received for this task. Napa County DEM needs to comply or the testing should be turned over to State regulators. Response Requested From Napa County Director of Environmental Management Napa County Board of Supervisors Finding 6 The Agriculture Commissioner, the Director of DEM and the Napa County Public Health Officer have investigated and found that there are no reports of any serious illnesses or injuries related to pesticide use in Napa County. There have been some mild eye and skin irritations or allergic reactions of a temporary nature in some pesticide workers. The Grand Jury finds that there is no data or evidence to link pesticide exposure with any chronic or long-term illness or injury affecting Napa County residents. Specifically, the Grand Jury finds that there is no evidence to indicate a clustering of cancer or higher incidences of cancer among residents in agricultural areas of the county or among agricultural workers.   Recommendation 6 The Public Health Officer, Agriculture Commissioner, and DEM should maintain public education programs which encourage reporting and detection of both acute and chronic illness related to pesticide exposure. All reasonable requests for investigation of illness or injury caused by pesticides should be fully investigated and tracked by a joint database and good communication between all three agencies. Property owners' requests for no pesticide use on their property should be honored. No forced spraying should be considered for areas around schools, daycare centers, hospitals, retirement homes, parks, tourist areas, medical and vet facilities, creeks and other bodies of water. Chemically sensitive persons, such as cancer patients, AIDS patients, asthmatics, and others with compromised immune systems should be notified prior to any spraying.

It utilizes two major software systems provided by Megabite (Property Tax) and PeopleSoft (Financial, Payroll/Personnel) and many in-house developed spreadsheets and databases tools, mostly developed on Microsoft Corporation product platforms. This department works closely with the County Treasurer's Office and the County Assessor. The County Auditor-Controller Department provides to county managers financial reports including budget information. SUMMARY OF GRAND JURY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Bartig, Basler & Ray (B.B &R.) is the certified public accountant firm contracted by the County to provide the independent audit of the county's annual financial statements. The current contract is for a period of three years for the Fiscal Years Ending (FYE) 2002, 2003 and 2004 and was renewed in 2001 . The County should contract with a different independent audit firm in the next cycle to ensure freshness of opinion. 2. The County is currently working to implement and comply with Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 34 (GASB34), which establishes new financial reporting requirements for state and local governments. In compliance with GASB-34, the Board of Supervisors established with the adoption of Resolution No. 01-83 a policy for budgetary controls that defines the value of fixed assets. The Grand Jury finds that the County's decision to expense physical assets individually valued at less than $5,000 that excludes those assets from the Balance Sheet will understate the property, plant and equipment assets held by Napa County. 3. In addition to its duties as the independent auditor, B.B. & R. also provides accounting services to the County, specifically in implementing GASB-34. The Grand Jury recommends that different entities perform the independent audit function and accounting service, especially when establishing Pro-Forma Financial Statements and new accounting standards. 4. Napa County maintains many trust fund accounts. Problems with trust fund accounting have occurred in the past. Internal reports used by the Auditor-Controller's Department to manage these Trust Funds demonstrate that the accounting processes are inadequate.   The County Board of Supervisors should require that the independent auditor review the Trust Fund accounting system, its internal control structure and procedures, and report to the Board of Supervisors those matters which it considers to be material or worthy of consideration. PROCEDURE I. The Grand Jury obtained the following information:   The County Auditor-Controller was interviewed. The lead independent audit manger from B.B.& R. was interviewed.  II. The Grand Jury reviewed:         County of Napa Management Reports For the Years Ended June 30, 2000 and June 30, 2001.

Overview B.B.&R. is the certified public accountant firm contracted by the County of Napa to provide the independent audit of the county's annual financial statements. This firm was originally awarded the outside audit contract by the county in 1986 for the FYE 1987,1988 and 1989. The contract with the county was subsequently extended to include FYE 1990,1991, 1992 and 1993.For the FYE 1994,1995 and 1996, Marcias & Company provided the outside independent audit service. In 1996, the county awarded a contract to B.B.&R. to conduct the independent audit function for the FYE 1997,1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. The contract with this firm was renewed to include FYE 2002, 2003 and 2004. The county included the 2000-2001 Napa County Grand Jury Audit Committee (Audit Committee) in the decision process for the most current contract. The County Auditor-Controller opined that with the implementation of GASB- 34 required in 2002, that the extension of the B.B.&R. contract was appropriate in consideration of the firm's familiarity of the County's financial systems and methods. The Audit Committee does not disagree with the Auditor-Controller's opinion. As permitted but not required by statute, the county may solicit competing bids to provide the annual independent audit of its financial statements, and should the county receive competing bids, it may award the contract based upon merit and cost. Regarding the most recently completed independent audit contract, no other accounting firm was requested to submit a proposal to provide the county with auditing services. Along with the independent audit function provided by B.B.& R. the Auditor-Controller's office requested that this firm provide consulting services (establish Pro-Forma Financial Statements for the FYE 2001) for the implementation of GASB-34. The scope of work described in the contract between B.B.&R. and the county executed in 2001 did not anticipate this additional work. It was believed by the Auditor-Controller that the Pro-Forma Financial Statements could be created by existing county staff. II. Policy for Budgetary Controls--Fixed Assets and GASB-34 The county is currently working to comply with GASB-34, Basic Financial Statements-- and Management's Discussion and Analysis--for State and Local Governments. The Preface to Statement No. 34 reads as follows: ""This Statement establishes new financial reporting requirements for state and local governments throughout the United States. When implemented, it will create new information and restructure much of the information that governments have presented in the past. We developed these new requirements to make annual reports more comprehensive and easier to understand and use."" One of the most significant changes to the financial   statements of the County of Napa will be the inclusion of capital assets , including infrastructure assets, in the county wide statement of net assets. Resolution No. 01-83, entitled ""Policy For Budgetary Controls"" was adopted June 19, 2001 by the Napa County Board of Supervisors and defines the policy for fixed assets in paragraph number 8 as follows: ""All requests to establish fixed assets, or to reallocate fixed asset appropriations, require the approval of the Board of Supervisors, either through the budget process or else during a Board of Supervisors meeting, and are to be established in the Equipment account line item (356600010). Fixed assets are those items of equipment, including PC's (sic) and related peripherals or furnishings, each valued at $5,000 or more."" Physical assets purchased by the County that are not capitalized and established as fixed assets under the County's policy are expensed in the current fiscal year. It is not clear to the Grand Jury that with the adoption of the policy and if by expensing rather than capitalizing physical assets, that those assets would be included in the Physical Assets Inventory (Asset Tagged) by Napa County. III. Trust Funds The County of Napa holds many trust funds. As of December 31, 2001 the Auditor-Controller was responsible for the accounting of 1,132 active trust fund accounts. The value of individual trust fund accounts varies from $0 to several million dollars. These accounts are broadly characterized by the following categories: County General Fund, Special Revenue Funds, Permanent Funds, Pension Funds, Investment Funds, Private Purpose Funds and Agency Funds. The trust funds are further identified by individual county departments, courts, agencies and commissions such as Health and Human Services, Public Works and the District Attorney's Office. Many but not all of these trust accounts accrue interest. Accounting for these trust fund accounts is cumbersome. Notations included on the Trust Fund Accounts spreadsheets provided to the Grand Jury and dated June 30, 2000, June 30, 2001 and December 31, 2001 indicate that many of the accounts are very old, should be inactivated, or should be valued at $0 at the fiscal year end (allocated) and yet show significant dollar amounts. In fairness to the Auditor-Controller Department, the Grand Jury acknowledges that spreadsheet notations indicate that various County entities were requested to provide information regarding trust fund accounts that could be made inactive or that required specific instructions by the entity as to how the funds should be allocated. In the two year financial period reviewed by this investigation specific to the Trust Fund accounts, the Grand Jury is able to conclude (based upon no change in the notations) that the County entities either ignored the request, did not prioritize the request or were not able to provide guidance in a timely manner.   Two examples of accounts that should show zero balances at year end are: 1. FBA:ST/CO PROP TAX ADM-AB818, Program # 10168, $956,163.73; and, 2. FBA:SUPPLEMENTAL-SB813, Program # 70018, $931,285.52. In theory, unallocated funds are not available to a county entity until such action occurs. Problems with Trust Fund accounting were made public last year after it was discovered that one Trust Fund Account (an interest accruing account specific to property tax) was inadvertently unaccounted for due to a change in the staff person responsible for property tax accounting, and partially due to a chronic staff shortage in the Auditor-Controller's office. Since this disclosure, the Auditor-Controller has implemented departmental cross-training programs to mitigate these sorts of accounting errors, and was able to fill staff vacancies. Finding 1 The County renewed the independent audit contract with B.B.&R. Recommendation 1 While the Grand Jury finds no material fault with the services provided by Bartig, Basler & Ray, the Grand Jury believes that it would be prudent for the county to contract with a different accounting firm to provide its annual independent audit after the current contract with Bartig, Basler & Ray is completed. While such a change may cause the county to pay more for the required auditing services, the Grand Jury believes that such a change is warranted in order to ensure a freshness in the opinion formed by the independent auditor with regards to the county's financial statements and as well, its consideration of the County of Napa's internal control over financial reporting. Response Requested From County Board of Supervisors County Executive Officer County Auditor-Controller Finding 2 The exclusion from the Balance Sheet of physical assets valued at less than $5,000 will understate the actual value of property, plant and equipment held by the County. Such an exclusion may be material. Furthermore, expensing physical assets that have a useful life of more than one year   presents an unclear picture of current year operating expenses and makes it difficult to analyze the government's financial performance. Recommendation 2 The Board of Supervisors should review the accounting decision made by its adoption of Resolution 01-83, Policy For Budgetary Controls. The Grand Jury recommends that the Board of Supervisors reduce the value of those physical assets to be included in the County's Balance Sheet to $750 with a useful life of more than one year for an individual item, or, $500 with a useful life of more than one year for items purchased in bulk, such as road signs, office fixtures and furnishings and similar items. Physical assets purchased by the county with a useful life of less than one year should be expensed. The adoption of such a modification in policy would better reflect the County of Napa's actual assets when identified separately from infrastructure assets such as roads, buildings and bridges. Such a policy modification would better reflect the current year expenditures in the County of Napa Annual Financial Report, provide easier analysis of original budget and revised budget figures, increase the usefulness of prior budget year comparisons to current and future years budgets, and also allow users (including the public) to assess the government's ability to estimate and manage its general resources. Response Requested From County Board of Supervisors Finding 3 The County of Napa contracts with B.B. & R. to provide independent audit services. Due to the required implementation of GASB-34, the County sought additional outside professional services (accounting services) to assist with the work associated with this endeavor. The County of Napa enlisted the services of B.B. & R. to establish Pro-Forma Financial Statements for the FYE 2001. Recommendation 3 The Grand Jury believes that undetected potential problems could occur when the accounting firm providing the independent audit is also conducting other accounting or consulting services. This is a basic separation of duties issue, and the above-described situation should not be repeated. In the future, the County of Napa should segregate accounting and independent audit services performed by outside companies.   Response Requested From County Board of Supervisors County Executive Officer County Auditor-Controller Finding 4 It is apparent that Trust Fund accounting needs further attention. As of June 30, 2001 total cash and investments in the county treasury per financial statements are $286,540,045. Even small errors or incomplete work by the Auditor-Controller's office may have significant impact upon the accounting of public funds. The Grand Jury notes that the independent auditor did not include any comments on the accounting of Trust Funds in its prior two Management Reports (Year Ended June 30, 2000 and Year Ended June 30, 2001). Recommendation 4 The Board of Supervisors, County Executive Officer, and the citizens of Napa County should expect that the Trust Funds held by the County of Napa be accounted for in a thorough, timely and accurate manner. Work not done at the close of accounting periods is work done poorly. The Board of Supervisors and County Executive Officer should instruct the independent auditor to review the Trust Fund accounting system, its internal control structure and procedures, and report to the Board of Supervisors those matters which it considers to be material or worthy of consideration. Response Requested From County Board of Supervisors County Executive Officer County Auditor-Controller   BUILDING DEPARTMENT  CITY OF NAPA  The Grand Jury reviewed the City of Napa Building Department. The investigation determined the following:       The City of Napa Building Department follows all State Codes. The four code books (Plumbing, Electrical, Mechanical, Building) are updated every three years. Wednesday Express Permits are issued the same day. The City Plan Checker is enforcing all the Building Codes. Classes to educate building professionals on the updated Codes are available. Stricter Building Codes in the State of California require more vigorous plan checking.  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 1. The Grand Jury found there to be widespread dissatisfaction in the construction community with the Napa City Building Department in its Building Permit Activities. 2. The dissatisfaction results from the Building Department changing its procedures to more rigorously enforce the Building Codes BACKGROUND The City Building Department is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Works and independent of the City Planning Department. The Building Department, however, must check with the Planning Department to determine if the General Plan and the Zoning Code allow the Building Permit to be issued. Due to several complaints against the City of Napa Building Department, several interviews took place with officials from the City of Napa Building Department and citizens that used the City of Napa Building Department to obtain building permits. The most frequent complaint was the turn-around time for the permit. If the building plans submitted by an architect were rejected, then it would be up to that architect to correct the plans and re-submit them as soon as possible. A good set of plans submitted for a larger project takes four to six weeks to receive a permit. The time frames   mentioned are from first applying for permits to receiving correction letters. All plans are reviewed by the City Plan Checker. There are three different types of obtaining permits and each type has a different time frame:    Full Project Permit  4-6 weeks Minor Project Permit  2 weeks Wednesday Express Permit  Wednesday only  There was an increase in the number of permits granted in 2001 due to the earthquake in September, 2000. Specifically, permits were granted to 229 single family dwellings, 2,530 residences (mainly remodeling), 269 commercial building (tenant improvements), and 12 industrial, B&B's, Motels, etc. The Wednesday Express Permit was designed by the Napa City Building Department after hearing the needs of the public. This is designed for simple projects such as decks, garages, porches, etc. New construction on commercial buildings takes four to five weeks. To speed the process of a permit, the City of Napa Building Department works closely with the City Planning Department, the City Fire Prevention Department, and the City Public works engineer.  Building Permit fees are determined by a cost per square foot of construction. The procedure is the same since 1985, but the cost per square foot has increased. Fees received for permit process goes into the City General Fund. Building Permit fees collected in Fiscal Year 2000/2001 were $896,195.94.  Since the Grand Jury began its examination of the Building Department, a new policy has been adopted by the City of Napa Building Department. When a plan is returned for corrections the third time, a meeting is set up with the owner of the property, the engineer, and the architect to discuss the issues and to clarify the code requirements. PROCEDURES The Grand Jury interviewed the following officials and citizens of Napa County:    City Building Official Director of Public Works Past Employees of the Napa City Building Department      Private Contractors, Real Estate Brokers using the Napa City Building Department The Grand Jury reviewed the following published data and reports regarding the Napa City Building Department:  Fee Activity Report  Special District Fees and Inclusionary Fees  Codes on Dangerous Buildings  Codes on Nuisances  Codes on Residential Districts  Finding 1 The Grand Jury found there to be widespread dissatisfaction in the construction community with the Napa City Building Department in its Building Permit Activities. The Grand Jury heard the comment several times that contractors, engineers, and designers refuse to do business in Napa because of the City of Napa Building Department. Recommendation 1 The City Council should instruct the Napa Building Department to take specific steps to promote better customer relations. Finding 2 The dissatisfaction results from the Building Department changing its procedures to more rigorously enforce the Building Codes. Recommendation 2 Professionals in the building community should take the classes offered by the Building Department to learn about updated Building Codes. Finding 3 In spite of the dissatisfaction, the Grand Jury found that the City of Napa Building Department is performing its duties in an appropriate manner. Recommendation 3 None.   Response Requested From Chief Building Inspector Department of Public Works Napa City Council   CODE ENFORCEMENT  CITY OF NAPA The Grand Jury reviewed the Code Enforcement Department and the Fire Department pertaining to the Code Enforcement. The investigation determined the following::      A Code Enforcement Officer (CEO) must have some legal background. The CEO strictly follows the Code Manual. The CEO must have a good knowledge of the Municipal Code. The CEO works on complaints only. Violators of the Penal Codes/Vehicle Codes are under jurisdiction of the Police Department.  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS Finding 1 The Grand Jury found no evidence that the CEO and the Fire Department's activities pertaining to the CEO were negligent in performing their duties. BACKGROUND The CEO handles the building codes, smoking ordinances, and noise ordinances for commercial and construction activity. The CEO works in conjunction with the Fire Department and Police Department. The jurisdiction for code enforcement is private property and businesses located within the City of Napa. The CEO works on complaints only. The average complaint results in a letter being sent to the violator and this takes 15 to 30 days. Additional staffing and a larger facility are necessary to expedite this process. As of now, there is one full-time assistant and one part-time retired California Highway Patrol Officer who works 3  days a week. The CEO strictly follows the Code Manual, which is updated at different times. But when it comes to enforcing fines due to violations, the CEO takes into account that not all violators have the financial means to pay the fines. A financial plan is worked out for the violator. The fees are adjusted annually. On the ""smoking ordinance,"" violators receive a courtesy letter with guidelines. If the smoking ordinance is not posted, the CEO will turn the situation over to Cal OSHA and there could be a fine imposed on the establishment owner. Fees collected from inspections go back to the City of Napa for inspection costs and other time incurred expenses.   If a violation is found while inspecting a business, the business owner is given the opportunity to fix the violation. The business will be inspected again at no charge and at that time, if the violation has not been corrected, a third inspection is scheduled, but there is a charge. If the violation has not been corrected, the business owner can be fined $1000 per day until the violation has been corrected. A complaint regarding a vehicle that had not been moved for seven months was referred to the City Police Department. The situation has been corrected. An ordinance is being reviewed now that would make it illegal to have a boat, trailer, or motor home parked on any public street for more than 72 hours. The following fees were collected as fines in the year 2000-2001 and are paid into the General Fund: Code Enforcement Violations Weed Abatement Program PROCEDURES The Grand Jury interviewed the following officials: Fire Marshal Code Enforcement Officer Employees of the Fire Department Chief of Police City Manager The Grand Jury reviewed the following published reports regarding code enforcement and the Fire Department: City of Napa  Logs of Maintenance Violations City of Napa Complaint Guidelines 1999 Finding l The Code Enforcement Section of the Fire Department is understaffed, underfunded and has inadequate office space. Recommendation 1 The City Council should provide the staff and space for the CEO to function properly. $2,150.44 $9,575.43   Finding 2 At the time of the Grand Jury inquiry, the Code Enforcement Department had a backlog of 52 complaints. Recommendation 2 None. Finding 3 There are insufficient funds raised from fines to pay for the cost of code enforcement. Recommendation 3 The fines should be increased to provide proper funding for code enforcement. Response Requested From City of Napa Code Enforcement Officer City of Napa Fire Chief Napa City Manager Napa City Council   FIRE DEPARTMENT  NAPA COUNTY The Napa County Fire Department (NCFD) is made up of State, County and City firefighting agencies located within Napa County. Napa County contracts with the California Department of Forestry (CDF) to provide for administrative services and support to NCFD under the terms of a negotiated Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). SUMMARY OF GRAND JURY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 1. NCFD has approximately 250 volunteer firefighters who deserve special recognition for providing a high level of dedicated and unpaid service to our community. The Grand Jury commends the volunteer firefighters in the NCFD. 2. There are difficulties with volunteer firefighter recruitment and retention in NCFD. This is a result of many factors including time required for training and certification requirements, lack of affordable housing in the County, and volunteers' unpaid status. The County should create a full-time paid staff at some volunteer fire stations and a system of pay-per-call for all volunteers. 3. The CDF Ranger Unit runs dispatch services for NCFD. CDF dispatchers are responsible for a very large and complicated sixcounty area of CDF stations in addition to local Napa County volunteer stations. There have been problems with some dispatchers' lack of familiarity with Napa County Volunteer station's dispatch needs. CDF Dispatch Command and some volunteer chiefs are not communicating well in resolving these problems. 4. CDF training sessions for volunteer stations have been inefficiently run and deficient in some cases. The County should create a Training Officer position only for NCFD Volunteers instead of relying on the CDF Training Officer. Additionally, the NCFD should pay the volunteers for training sessions. 5. CDF staffing policy has resulted in delays in routine equipment maintenance and providing warehouse supplies for the volunteer stations. Improved staffing and record-keeping practices are recommended. 6. The concept of all the volunteer chiefs acting as a meaningful Volunteer Chief Advisory Board is no longer effective. The volunteer chiefs that are content with the current system are content because   they are favored with equipment requests and other CDF resources. Other volunteer chiefs are less content and believe that CDF has no interest in volunteer chief participation in running NCFD. The Napa County Board of Supervisors (BOS) should reevaluate its decision to have CDF administer the NCFD, rather than the County. If the Napa County BOS chooses to maintain the current CDF administered system for NCFD, the BOS should have at least one high level County administrator assigned exclusively to work with all of the NCFD Volunteer chiefs. 7. In last year's NCFD Budget, there was a large surplus of revenue available at the end of the fiscal year. This is money that was not disbursed, but was ""rolled over"" into this year's budget and is kept in an interest bearing Fire Protection Fund (1080). The amount of money in this fund was $3,278,727 as of 1/31/2002. This Grand Jury does not have the resources to examine the reasons for this surplus in the account or to recommend a resolution to the question of excess funding in Fund 1080. The Grand Jury recommends that the Board of Supervisors appoint a team of County staff including an auditor to look into the issue and make recommendations to the Board including changes to the MOU if necessary. PROCEDURE I. The Grand Jury obtained the following information:  All nine County Volunteer chiefs were asked to complete a fourpage questionnaire regarding their experiences with CDF support of their fire station's staff, equipment, facilities, training, dispatch and activities. Seven chiefs returned the survey. Five County Volunteer chiefs in the unincorporated area were interviewed. The Calistoga and St. Helena Volunteer Fire Department Chiefs were interviewed. CDF/NCFD administrative officials were interviewed, including the Chief, Deputy Chief, Asst. Chief Administration and Staff Services Analyst. The County Auditor/Controller was interviewed. The County Management Analyst for NCFD Budget was interviewed.        II. The Grand Jury reviewed:  NCFD Incident summaries for the years 2000 and 2001.         Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Napa County and CDF Contracts between State (CDF), County and Cities for NCFD NCFD Budget Reports for 1999-2000, 2000-01, and 2001-02.

NCFD Overview In 1973 the Napa County Board of Supervisors (BOS) created the Napa County Fire Department (NCFD) to provide cooperative fire protection and emergency services to the unincorporated areas of Napa County. The NCFD is a collaborative effort, consisting of California Department of Forestry (CDF) administrative coordination for the four CDF stations (which are staffed fulltime with State paid CDF firefighters), and the nine unincorporated area volunteer fire stations located throughout the county (staffed with unpaid volunteers on call). The local CDF regional office is near St. Helena, adjacent to the St. Helena CDF Fire Station. The CDF Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit Chief has   responsibility for a six-county area for State CDF fire protection activities, and currently also serves as NCFD Chief. Napa County has other contracts with the CDF to augment County fire protection. These include NCFD contracts with Calistoga, St. Helena, Napa State Hospital and Schell-Vista Fire Protection District stations for the provision of services to the unincorporated areas adjoining these agencies. The CDF additionally provides dispatching services for American Canyon and Napa State Hospital. The County contracts with the Town of Yountville and the California Veterans Home to provide fire services in those areas. The Cities of Calistoga, Napa, St Helena and American Canyon administrate their own municipal fire departments. The CDF is contracted to provide training, equipment and dispatch services for the County Volunteer stations and in most instances, to pay for the stations utilities. The volunteer stations and local communities are responsible for providing their own personnel and providing land and buildings for the station facilities. The volunteers maintain their own facilities getting funding from various sources, including local community groups, community fundraisers and individual donors. The volunteers also provide local training, transportation costs, and uniforms at their own expense. The volunteers are covered by liability and Worker's Compensation insurance paid for by the County while on duty. Volunteer firefighters are generally unpaid for their service, unless the CDF uses them for a ""State Fire"" activity, at which time they are compensated on an hourly basis starting after the first two hours of service. The County pays CDF an amount equal to 11.13% of NCFD expenditures for their administrative services under the terms of a negotiated Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that is reviewed annually to reflect budget changes and changing needs by the communities served. The MOU generally calls for replacement of fire apparatus after about 15 years, although in some cases equipment is used for much longer periods of time. A 10-year schedule outlines equipment replacement and station maintenance needs. II. CDF Administration Several volunteer chiefs would prefer more support from CDF than they are currently getting. These volunteer chiefs believe that they are ""out of the loop"" on NCFD decision-making and budget input for their stations. A Volunteer Chief Advisory Board exists, but has no meaningful advisory function according to these volunteer chiefs. CDF is very large and runs a topdown management system. These chiefs believe that CDF has no interest in volunteer chief participation in running NCFD. It has been difficult for these volunteer chiefs to communicate with CDF supervisors. There have been occasions when chiefs do not get their emails and telephone calls returned in a timely manner when problems arise.   In a survey this year of the County Volunteer Chiefs by the Grand Jury, considerable frustration was expressed over a variety of these unresolved issues. Some of these chiefs were also concerned about a lack of identity and pride in the NCFD. Some believe this is due in part because NCFD is administered by a State agency, rather than a County agency. These chiefs believe that the six-county CDF Ranger Unit has such a large area of responsibility that the NCFD seems to get lower priority from CDF in attention and resources, especially in summer months when CDF is busy. Volunteer chiefs out of favor with CDF administrators believe that they do not receive the same material support for their stations that other chiefs receive. There are other volunteer chiefs who are content with CDF administration and think that most of their station's needs are currently being met by the CDF contracts with Napa County. They say that things have gotten better in the past few years, and are continuing to improve. They believe that a NCFD independent of CDF would not bring any new benefits to the volunteer stations. In their opinion, CDF provides many additional services to the County at no cost that are not part of the MOU. III. Volunteer Chief Advisory Board Article 3, section 3:2.1 of the Memorandum of Understanding between County of Napa and Volunteer Fire Departments calls for a permanent board comprised of all nine volunteer chiefs: "" ...for the purpose of reviewing current and projected operations of the Napa County Fire Department...The positions and opinions of this board will be strongly considered and shall contribute to policy decisions made by the County Fire Chief..."" According to testimony received by the Grand Jury this Volunteer Chief Advisory Board does not function as specified by the MOU. The Grand Jury believes that the purpose of the MOU was to allow all the volunteer chiefs to be meaningfully involved in decisions involving NCFD policy and operations. IV. Budget and Audit It is not clear to the Grand Jury or many volunteer chiefs exactly how NCFD funds are spent or how much is being allocated to each NCFD station. Some chiefs have had to get needed engine or station equipment and upgrades from their own community fund-raisers because of CDF Equipment Committee denial for equipment requests. The CDF policy of ""just ask and we will provide it"" is not working for all the volunteer chiefs.   The CDF Staff Services Analyst (SSA) went through a line-item review of 2001-02 NCFD revenues and expenditures with the Grand Jury. The Grand Jury notes that it is not possible to track all disbursements for the individual NCFD Volunteer stations under the CDF budget reporting system. The SSA believes that the volunteer fire station's individual needs are too unpredictable and diverse to budget specific amounts for each station. The exception to this is that each County Volunteer Chief receives $3000/yr from CDF that is discretionary. The County has not routinely audited the NCFD Budget. The NCFD Budget was audited for the first time in fiscal year 1999-2000 in many years. The following NCFD record keeping deficiencies were noted by the fiscal year 1999-2000 Audit:  ""Finding: In testing cash disbursements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000, the claims were inputted and approved on the Batch Control Sheet by the same employee. In addition, the Department did not retain the signed copy of the Control Batch Sheet that authorized payment to the vendor for claims entered prior to February of 2000."" ""Finding: During the examination of cash disbursements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000, it was noted that the claim amount exceeded the $3,000 limit established by the AuditorController's Office for 4 out of 25 transactions examined. Based on these results, all expenditure accounts were scanned for claims in excess of the $3,000 limit. An additional 36 transactions were in excess of the $3,000 limit. The amounts range from $3,053 to $14,243."" ""Finding: During the examination of the Department's cash receipts for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, it was noted that 4 out of 10 deposits examined did not have supporting documentation that could be reconciled to the general ledger.""      The County Auditor made recommendations on correcting these problems. The SSA noted in CDF Management's response to these audit findings that all three findings have been corrected and subsequent record keeping will comply with the Auditor's recommendations. Finding 1 The NCFD Volunteers consist of approximately 250 dedicated and hardworking men and women who spend many unpaid hours training and working   for their local communities in fire prevention programs, fire protection and medical emergency calls. COMMENDATION The Grand Jury commends the volunteers in the NCFD for their long hours of service and training dedicated to the safety and support of our communities. The value of this currently unpaid work force is significant and should be acknowledged by our community. Finding 2 There are problems with volunteer firefighter recruitment and retention in Napa County. Several volunteer stations are short on numbers of volunteers. In recent years, the number of persons interested in volunteer firefighting has been decreasing. Each year, as our County population increases, the volunteer stations in NCFD are called upon to increase their workload. Data confirm that most stations are making more calls each year. The annually increasing callout rate is wearing on many of the volunteers. Recruiting and staffing of volunteer stations has become more difficult for most of the chiefs (there are a couple of exceptions to this where local community support is very strong). This difficulty is due to a combination of factors, including the rigorous training and certification required by the State, the time commitment necessary, problems with access to affordable housing in Napa County, and the fact that volunteer firefighters are not paid. At some stations, high volunteer turnover rate keeps training sessions to basics. Many younger volunteers eventually quit volunteer work to join paid fire departments or to pursue other paying jobs. Emergency calls during Monday-Friday daytime hours are the most challenging for most volunteer fire stations. Most of the volunteers are not readily available during those hours because they are working at their regular jobs, sometimes located out of area. Evenings and weekends are generally easier to staff. Recommendation 2 The Grand Jury recommends that the County initiate a paid weekday full-time staff of firefighters at certain volunteer stations where necessary. This could include a paid chief and one or two full-time paid firefighters. Calistoga initiated a system like this three years ago with good results; the City of St. Helena Fire Department also has a part-time paid chief. Some volunteer stations may not require this where staff is always readily available.   This paid staff would facilitate Monday-Friday daytime calls, do local administrative work, keep up the facilities at the station, organize training/recruiting and most importantly, have a permanent staffing voice that could be more effectively heard by the NCFD administration. This system would decrease response times for emergency calls Monday-Friday daytime at some stations, as weekday staff would be available immediately at the volunteer stations. The NCFD should supplement the proposed full-time paid County fire station staff with a pay-per-call system where other on-call volunteers could handle evening and weekend calls, and would be paid on an hourly basis for all calls. Response Requested From CDF Napa County Board of Supervisors Napa County Executive Officer Finding 3 Central Dispatch located in the City of Napa initially receives most emergency ""911"" calls. For the unincorporated areas of Napa County, medical emergency and fire calls are then relayed to CDF Dispatch in St Helena. These calls are then relayed again to the appropriate volunteer firefighters via pagers or local community sirens. There have been delays of 8 minutes and longer from when a County resident dials 911 until the call is relayed to the volunteer station staff. A response time of 5 minutes or less to arrive on scene in order to initiate CPR or defibrillation is the goal generally accepted by most rescue agencies. CDF Dispatch is a complex system. When CDF initiated dispatching for the combined six-county CDF Ranger Unit, many observers felt that NCFD dispatching decreased in quality. Dispatchers have made errors when dispatching some NCFD Volunteer station fire engines. This has been either the result of inexperienced CDF Dispatch personnel, or from faulty information listed in the CAD (Computer Assisted Dispatch). There have been incidents of dispatchers sending the wrong fire engines to County fires or medical emergencies because they do not know all the proper dispatch tones or areas of responsibility for the volunteer stations. Some volunteer chiefs have had difficulty getting CDF dispatch administrators or supervisors to acknowledge and address these dispatch errors.   Recommendation 3 The Grand Jury recognizes that it is a demanding task for CDF Dispatch to handle the six-county CDF Ranger Unit as well as NCFD dispatching. Nonetheless, all dispatchers need to be proficient in their knowledge of NCFD and required to perform this task at the highest level. Dispatchers need to know the proper tones, stations, roadways and volunteer areas of responsibility for all of Napa County. Dispatch Command needs to assure that Computer Assisted Dispatch (CAD) information is up to date and accurate for NCFD dispatch purposes. As problems arise with unsatisfactory CDF Dispatch performance, NCFD Volunteer chiefs need to be able to communicate effectively with CDF supervisors and get responses and honest efforts at problem solving from these administrators without delay. Response Requested From CDF Napa County Board of Supervisors Napa County Executive Officer Finding 4 CDF training for volunteers has been inconsistent, partly due to the fact that the CDF Training Officers have been transferred or promoted every two years on average. This constant turnover has created prolonged vacancies in the position at times and has led to poor continuity in volunteer training sessions provided by CDF. Many volunteer chiefs describe the CDF Training Officer position as a ""stepping stone"" where qualified personnel are moved or promoted to other jobs after a short period of time. Some volunteer chiefs complained that CDF training personnel do not always show up when they are scheduled and do not seem to give much priority to volunteer training sessions. Some volunteer chiefs have been told that CDF cannot give training to volunteers in summer months, due to their own CDF staffing needs. One volunteer chief has learned to rely more on neighboring CDF fire station personnel for training than on the CDF administration. He arranges training directly with the CDF stations rather than using the CDF Training Officer. Other chiefs rely mostly on their own local volunteer training programs. The recent appointment of a volunteer firefighter to the CDF County Training Officer position may help alleviate these training problems. This will likely depend on how long he is kept in that position by CDF, and the quality of the volunteer training the CDF allows him to implement.   County unincorporated area station volunteers are not paid for either CDF training sessions or local training sessions. Recommendation 4 An improved and more reliable CDF training system should be implemented to make sure CDF fulfills its training agreements with the County for the volunteers. It may be necessary to reconsider the policy of changing the CDF Training Officer position every two years. One solution would be to create a specific County Training Officer position only for NCFD Volunteers, instead of relying on the CDF Training Officer. NCFD Volunteers should get the same high quality of training in a reliable and consistent manner, as do paid firefighters. Paid volunteer training sessions would likely improve County Volunteer participation, morale and performance. The Grand Jury recommends that NCFD pay the volunteers for training sessions. Response Requested From CDF Napa County Board of Supervisors County Executive Officer Finding 5 For most of fiscal year 2000-01, there was only one full-time employee at the CDF Maintenance Station in St. Helena providing all NCFD fire engine, emergency and routine equipment maintenance. Most of the volunteer chiefs think that this employee performs very well and does an excellent job, but he needs more help. There have been incidents of long waits (months) for routine maintenance service due to this staffing shortage. Some chiefs are waiting long periods for equipment testing and having to make do without equipment due to these delays. One full-time person staffs the CDF/NCFD warehouse and on occasion supply needs are slow to be filled. Usually there is no staffing of the warehouse on weekends. No data are published regarding the distribution of supplies to individual volunteer stations. Recommendation 5 A delay of months in some instances for routine maintenance seems excessive. There should be adequate maintenance staff persons available to address NCFD needs for timely equipment routine service.   The CDF/NCFD warehouse should be adequately staffed and supplies readily available to the volunteer stations whenever necessary, including on weekends. There should be records available regarding distribution of supplies to individual NCFD Volunteer stations and tracking for the costs of these disbursements. Response Requested From CDF Napa County Board of Supervisors County Executive Officer Finding 6 The concept outlined by the MOU where the volunteer chiefs act as a meaningful Volunteer Chief Advisory Board is not working well. The volunteer chiefs that are content with the current system are content because they are favored by receiving equipment requests and other CDF resources. Other volunteer chiefs are less content and believe that CDF has no interest in volunteer chief participation in running NCFD. Recommendation 6 The Napa County Board of Supervisors (BOS) should reconsider its decision to have CDF administer the NCFD rather than the County. If the BOS chooses to maintain the current CDF administrated system for NCFD, the BOS should have at least one high level County administrator assigned exclusively to work with all of the NCFD Volunteer chiefs. This person should be readily available to the volunteer chiefs, and should communicate with all nine chiefs on an equal basis. This person would act as a liaison between CDF and the volunteer stations and would speak on behalf of the volunteer stations to the County Administrator and BOS in dealing with all the different segments of the NCFD system. This person should also see that funds for equipment are distributed fairly. Response Requested From CDF Napa County Board of Supervisors Napa County Executive Officer   Finding 7 In last year's NCFD Budget, there was a large surplus of revenue available at the end of the fiscal year. This is money that was not disbursed, but was ""rolled over"" into this year's budget and is kept in an interest bearing Fire Protection Fund (1080). The amount of money in this fund was $3,278,727 as of 1/31/2002 according to the County Auditor. Recommendation 7 This Grand Jury does not have the resources to examine the reasons for this surplus or to recommend a resolution to the question of excess funding in Fund 1080. The Grand Jury recommends that the Board of Supervisors appoint a team of County staff including an auditor to look into the issue and make recommendations to the Board including changes to the MOU if necessary. Response Requested From CDF Napa County Auditor/Controller Napa County Board of Supervisors Napa County Executive Officer   NAPA RIVER FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT The Napa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (NFC) has historically been an agency of the County of Napa operating as a division of the Napa County Department of Public Works. In 1998 the voters of Napa County passed an increase of one half of one percent in the sales tax to fund the local share of a $180,000,000 (estimate at the time) Napa Flood Management Plan designed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with great input from Community Coalition for Napa Flood Management. The NFC sponsored the Plan. In the process, the NFC Board of Directors, formerly the Board of Supervisors was changed to add to the Board of Supervisors the Mayors of each of the County's Cities and a City Council person from the City of Napa. In 1999 bonds were sold in the amount of $43,650,000 to finance the start of the plan. SUMMARY OF GRAND JURY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Finding 1 Income from the sales tax is running ahead of projections by 7.1 million dollars in three years. Finding 2 In the acquisition files examined by the Grand Jury there was no instance in which the original offer was less than the appraised value. In only one instance was there an appraisal with a range of value and in that instance the initial offer was at the highest of the range. Finding 3 The antagonism and bitterness that resulted from condemnation is the fault of the process and not the fault of FCD personnel. The better the process is understood by the property owner, the less the bitterness. Finding 4 Negotiations for the acquisition of property and relocation expenses are conducted by consultants hired by the FCD and only rarely by FCD personnel.   Finding 5 FCD personnel have conducted themselves honorably and with integrity in the land acquisition process, and the grand jury commends them for their conduct. Finding 6 The Grand Jury finds that, other than going permanently out of business, one of the worst things that can happen to a business that is located on property needed for the Project is to be closed from the time of the order of possession until a new location can be found. Temporary closure is devastating to most businesses. Recommendation 6 The Board of Supervisors of the County and the Planning Commission and Planning Staff of the County and the City Councils of the County's Cities and their Planning Commissions and their Staffs should make every effort to accommodate applications for relocation of businesses closed by the Project, including but not limited to giving priority to such applications over other applications. BACKGROUND In July 2001 the local costs were estimated to be: Land Acquisition Relocations Cash District Maintenance Total 93,494,000 51,865,000 9,558,000 1,035,000 155,952,000  In addition, Federal costs were estimated to total $83,600,000. The Plan provides flood protection through reconnecting the Napa River to it historical floodplain and restores over 600 acres of tidal wetlands. It is designed to protect 2700 homes, 350 businesses and more than 50 public properties. In order to accomplish the Plan the FCD has determined that it is necessary to acquire 292 properties including 219 tenants by agreement with the owners or by condemnation if no agreement can be reached. In July 2001 it was estimated by the FCD that it would spend more than 93 million dollars to acquire property and over 50 million dollars in relocation costs. A Financial Oversight Committee was appointed by the Board of Supervisors to oversee the   expenditure of funds. It was estimated that the Project would be completed within five to seven years. As of March 2002: Local Principal and Interest Land Acquisition Relocations Cash District Maintenance Estimated 111,239,000 93,494,000 51,865,000 9,558,000 1,035,000 Spent 1,801,000 67,000,000 8,172,000 3,111,000 5,000  By March 5, 2002 the FCD has made offers to purchase to 100 owners. Of the 100 offers, settlement has been reached with 83. It has also made offers to purchase 219 tenants, of which 206 have been accepted. It has brought condemnation proceedings against 23 owners and settled 11 of the 23. It has engaged in mediation with 5 owners and settled with 4. Of the 100 offers to owners, 54 were mobile home owners. The 83 offers that have been accepted include the 11 that settled after condemnation proceedings were initiated. Of the estimated $93,494,000 the sum of $67,000,000 has been spent leaving a balance of $26,494,000. Of the 292 properties sought to be acquired, 83 have been acquired and 17 offers are outstanding leaving 192 properties upon which offers have not been made. Offers cannot be made on most until the engineering is completed by the Corps of Engineers and a determination of what is needed is made. FCD believes that the $26,494,000 remaining will be enough because the remaining lands to be acquired are partial takes to accommodate the wall/levy/pathway. In 1998 it was estimated that revenues generated by the half cent sales tax would be as shown in the following table. Growth was estimated at 3% per year. In fact revenues were generated as shown: Year 98-99 99-00 00-01 01-02 02-03 03-04 04-05 Estimate 6.8M 7.0M 7.2M 7.4M 7.6M 7.8M 8.1M Actual 7.8M 9.9M 10.4M  Revenues have exceeded estimates by $7.1 million in three years. The original assumptions included reimbursement from the State of California of $75,000,000 and $30,000,000 from the Corps of Engineers for   acquisition and relocation. In July 2001, FCD reported to the Financial Oversight Committee that it feared that the State and the Corps would not meet the assumptions and reduced them to $33,500,000 and $7,000,000 respectively. If the new assumptions are correct it will take longer to complete the project which will increase the cost of the project. While the Financial Oversight Committee and the staff of the FCD are aware of the problem, the problem seems to have failed to get the attention of the Board of Supervisors, the City Councils and the public. California and Federal law and the State and Federal Constitutions dictate the process by which land is acquired by the FCD and by which relocation expenses are paid. It is an antiquated process designed to make sure that the property owner is paid the fair value of the property and the taxpayer is paying no more than the fair value of the property. The Grand Jury reviewed seventeen of the files of properties, which have been settled. FCD uses thirteen different very qualified appraisers, four of whom are from Napa. The FCD uses a consultant to negotiate with the property owner. Occasionally the property owner's estimation of the value of the property in question is much higher than the consultant's, sometimes double or more. Sometimes the property owner's opinion is correct. In the absence of agreement, the process results in dueling appraisals and bitterness on the part of the property owner. The process is not a friendly process. It is conducted by the FCD's consultants and not by FCD personnel except when negotiations break down and FCD staff is asked to step in. The process has improved since the first cases were settled and both sides learned when their positions were unreasonable. PROCEDURE In July 2001, the Grand Jury determined to look into the progress of the Project in terms of income, expense and projected income and expense and the acquisition of property and payment of relocation expense. The Grand Jury interviewed FCD executives and FCD consultants and property owner's and tenants whose properties were either threatened with condemnation or against whom condemnation actions had been filed, and tenants who were entitled to relocation assistance. The Grand Jury visited sites slated for condemnation and interviewed the people involved in negotiations for acquisition of properties required for the Project. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Finding 1 Income from the sales tax is running ahead of projections by 7.1 million dollars in three years.   Recommendation 1 None. Finding 2 In the files examined by the Grand Jury there was no instance in which the original offer was less than the appraised value. In only one instance was there an appraisal with a range of value and in that instance the initial offer was at the highest of the range. There is no instance in which a settlement was less than the original offer. Recommendation 2 The Flood Control District should continue to make its original offer at the highest appraised price. Finding 3 The antagonism and bitterness that resulted from condemnation is the fault of the process and not the fault of FCD personnel. The better the process is understood by the property owner, the less the bitterness. Recommendation 3 While the antagonism and bitterness are not going to go away, a better effort should be made by FCD to educate the property owner about the process and about how the property owner might go about determining the value of the property. Finding 4 Negotiations for the acquisition of property and relocation expenses are conducted by consultants hired by the FCD and only rarely by FCD personnel. Recommendation 4 FCD personnel should not be involved in original negotiations nor in every negotiation, but should be able to step in when the situation appears hopeless. Finding 5 FCD personnel have conducted themselves honorably and with integrity in the land acquisition process, and the grand jury commends them for their conduct.   Recommendation 5 None. Finding 6 The Grand Jury finds that, other than going permanently out of business, one of the worst thing that can happen to a business that is located on property needed for the Project is to be closed from the time of the order of possession until a new location can be found. Temporary closure is devastating to most businesses. Recommendation 6 The Board of Supervisors of the County and the Planning Commission and Planning Staff of the County and the City Councils of the County's Cities and their Planning Commissions and their Staffs should make every effort to accommodate applications for relocation of businesses closed by the Project, including but not limited to giving priority to such applications over other applications. Finding 7 In several instances the appraisal value because the cost of toxic clean up each instance if the FCD found that the contamination on the property it offered deduction of any clean up cost. Recommendation 7 None. Finding 8 The FCD has proceeded to attempt to collect the cost of contamination clean up from the original polluter where possible. Recommendation 8 None. identified a property as having no exceeded the value of the property. In current owner had not placed the the full appraised value without   Finding 9 If the Federal share and the State share are not forthcoming, and in fact pay only that which is now budgeted by the FCD, there will be a short fall of revenues that will increase the cost of the project beyond the amount of the shortfall. Recommendation 9 The FCD staff should report to the Financial Oversight Committee, the Board of Supervisors, the various City Councils and the public through the media the nature and extent of the shortfall and the contingency plans to meet it. Response Requested From (to Findings 2, 3, 4, 6 and 9) Napa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District Board   NAPA-VALLEJO WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY A joint committee of the Napa and Solano County Grand Juries was appointed to review the activities of the Napa Vallejo Waste Management Authority, a Joint Powers Authority (JPA). SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Finding 1 The JPA has no staff of its own and is operated by the Napa County Department of Environmental Health staff in a very efficient manner. No single person is assigned full time to the JPA. Two or three of the Department's staff are assigned to the JPA along with their regular duties. Recommendation 1 The JPA should continue to be operated without a staff of its own. Finding 2 The County made a decision in 1993 to build the transfer station to avoid the liability for closure of another landfill. The JPA made a decision in 1997 to switch from truck to rail to truck to truck, because liability for closure of another landfill was no longer a problem. Recommendation 2 None. The County made the correct decision in each case. Finding 3 The JPA is paying Allied Waste Inc. (Allied) $54 a ton. It includes the cost of operation of the transfer station, transporting the waste to Keller Canyon and the fees charged by an Allied subsidiary to dispose of the waste at Keller Canyon. Because the $54 per ton is not broken down, it is not possible to tell if Allied is making more than it should on the cost of the operation of the transfer station, the transportation of the waste and the cost of disposal. The actual cost of burying the waste should be $8 to $9 per ton. Recommendation 3 The JPA should allow no further extensions of Allied's contract, and when the contract expires in 2007 the JPA should open Allied's contract to   competitive bidding. The Request for Proposals should require each bidder to itemize the various elements of the bid: 1. Operation of the transfer station 2. Transportation from the transfer station to the landfill 3. Disposal of the waste at the landfill The JPA could then award the low bid on operation to the lowest bidder for operation. If the low bid for transportation was from a different bidder the low bidder on the operation could be allowed to meet the transportation bid, or there could be bids awarded to different entities to take advantage of the low bid. The low bid for disposal at the landfill could come from yet another bidder. In any event it will be possible to issue a contract at a price which combines the lowest bid for the cost of operation of the transfer station, the cost of transportation and the cost of disposal at a landfill. BACKGROUND The Napa Vallejo Waste Management Authority, a joint powers authority (JPA) was created in 1993 to build and run a transfer station located south of the Napa County Airport in Napa County for handling of solid waste. The County of Napa was the lead decision maker. The decision was made because the County, at the time, was unable to avoid the liability of the cost of closure of the landfills in the area. The JPA was created by the County of Napa, the City of Napa and the City of Vallejo in response to the imminent closure of the American Canyon Landfill. At the time the City of American Canyon was not yet incorporated, but the waste stream from the area of the future city went to the American Canyon Landfill which is located in the unincorporated area of Napa County. The City of American Canyon joined the JPA in 1997 after it was incorporated. The JPA acquired the American Canyon Landfill by agreeing to pay the cost of closure. Closure involves three aspects; (1) placing a cap over the landfill, (2) extracting the methane gas and (3) collecting the leachate. The capping is 66% complete and the gas collection is 66% complete. The JPA has $8,451,335 in cash or cash equivalents to complete the closure and $1,055,464 in an account that the State of California requires have $1,000,000 in it to deal with unforeseen environmental problems. Closure should be complete by 2005. In order to pay for the transfer station the JPA sold $14,165,000 of 1994 Revenue Bonds which mature in 20 years. At the time the JPA was called the South Napa Waste Management Authority. It subsequently changed its name to the Napa Vallejo Waste Management Authority. The principal and interest on the bonds have been paid as they have come due and the balance on the bonds, as of August 15, 2001, is $10,945,000. The debt service is $1,285,035   per year. The bond underwriters required a coverage ratio of 1.25 which means that the income of the operation must exceed expenditures by 125%. In fiscal year 1999-00 the actual coverage was 1.62 and in 2000-01 the actual coverage was 1.49. The bond underwriters projected a constant waste stream of 170,00 tons. The JPA projects a constant waste stream of 190,000 tons. The March 28, 2000 rating of the bonds by Fitch IBCA is ""A-"". The JPA is operated by a board of directors of four, one from each of the four entities comprising the JPA. The transfer station was completed and opened in the 1995-96 fiscal year. The JPA contracted with Rabanco to operate the facility. The two Napa garbage companies and Vallejo Garbage Company delivered the waste to the transfer station where Rabanco received it, loaded it on railroad cars, and shipped it to the state of Washington. In 1990 the State of California mandated a reduction in the waste stream going to landfills of 25% by the year 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. Recycling facilities were constructed in both Napa County and the City of Vallejo. In the 1995-96 fiscal year the transfer station handled 156,000 tons of waste. In 1999-2000 the tonnage was 199,266 and in 2000-01 207,388 tons. The rate paid by the garbage companies when the transfer station first went into operation in 1996 was $60.27 per ton. In 1999 Rabanco was purchased by Allied Waste, the second largest waste management company in the U.S. The sale had to be approved by the JPA. The JPA approved the sale, but conditioned its approval on a rewrite of the Rabanco contract to lower cost disposal and transportation options and change the annual CPI escalator. The contract had called for an annual upward adjustment for Rabanco of 85% of the CPI. Allied, through an asset swap, had acquired a landfill near Pittsburg in Contra Costa County called Keller Canyon from Browning Ferris Industries (BFI) before acquiring Rabanco. Allied later purchased all of BFI. Allied, with the consent of the JPA, changed the operation of the transfer station from a truck to rail operation to a truck to truck operation and now hauls the waste from the transfer station to Keller Canyon. The JPA can now reasonably rely on Allied's financial position to pay the cost of closure of Keller Canyon, something the County could not do in 1993 when the decision to build the Transfer Station was made. Allied has received two one year extensions on its contract from 2005 to 2006 on one occasion and 2006 to 2007 on a second occasion. The first extension was in exchange for the change from rail to truck and for a reduction in rate from $70 a ton to $54 a ton. The second was in exchange for Allied making improvements to the transfer station, improving the internal traffic flow, providing additional scales, a recycling and reuse area, and extension of operating hours, and personnel to operate the recycling and reuse area.   The Grand Jury learned that the rate for Potrero Hills Landfill is $39.50 a ton, Fresno is $46.33 a ton and Redwood Landfill (Sonoma County) is $38.89 a ton. The numbers are not meaningful because it cannot be determined what is included. Napa Garbage Service has been advised by Republic Waste, who now owns Potrero Hills, that it will take waste at $20 per ton. The Grand Jury has been advised that the cost of burying waste should be from $8 to $9 a ton. The Contra Costa County Joint Powers Authority runs a transfer station in Martinez. It is paying Allied $30.94 a ton for disposal at Keller Canyon. In October 2000 the City of Fairfield issued a ""Request for Proposals"" for its waste disposal. Allied bid January 8, 2001. Its bid included disposal at Keller Canyon at $36.19 per ton. The bid included the cost of purchasing trucks, hauling to the Martinez transfer station, transfer station costs, hauling from Martinez to Keller Canyon and lastly disposal at Keller Canyon. PROCEDURES The Grand Jury interviewed the Director of the Department of Environmental Health, Department of Environmental Health staff and visited the Transfer Station. It interviewed staff at the City of Fairfield, and the Contra Costa County Waste Authority and various individuals employed in waste disposal in Northern California. It reviewed the ""Request for Proposals"" prepared by the City of Fairfield and Allied's response. Finding 1 The JPA has no staff of its own and is operated by the Napa County Department of Environmental Health staff in a very efficient manner. No single person is assigned full time to the JPA. Two or three of the Department's staff are assigned to the JPA along with their regular duties. Recommendation 1 The JPA should continue to be operated without a staff of its own. Response Requested From Napa County Department of Environmental Health The Napa  Vallejo Waste Management Authority Napa City Council Napa County Board of Supervisors   Finding 2 The County made a decision in 1993 to build the transfer station to avoid the liability for closure of another landfill. The JPA made a decision in 1997 to switch from truck to rail to truck to truck, because liability for closure of another landfill was no longer a problem. Recommendation 2 None. The County made the correct decision in each case. Response Requested From None Finding 3 The JPA is paying Allied $54 a ton. It includes the cost of operation of the transfer station, transporting the waste to Keller Canyon and the fees charged by Allied to dispose of the waste at Keller Canyon. Because the $54 per ton is not broken down, it is not possible to tell if Allied is making more than it should on the cost of the operation of the transfer station, the transportation of the waste and the cost of disposal. The actual cost of burying the waste should be $8 to $9 per ton. Recommendation 3 The JPA should allow no further extensions of Allied's contract, and when the contract expires in 2007 the JPA should open Allied's contract to competitive bidding. The Request for Proposals should require each bidder to itemize the various elements of the bid: 1. Operation of the transfer station 2. Transportation from the transfer station to the landfill 3. Disposal of the waste at the landfill The JPA could then award the low bid on operations to the lowest bidder for operations. If the low bid for transportation from the transfer station to the landfill was from a different bidder the low operations bidder could be allowed to meet the transportation bid, or there could be bids awarded to different entities to take advantage of both low bids. The low bid for disposal at the landfill could come from yet another bidder. In any event it will be possible to issue a contract at a price which combines the lowest bid for the cost of operation of the transfer station, the cost of transportation and the cost of disposal at a landfill.   Response Requested From Napa County Department of Environmental Health The Napa  Vallejo Waste Management Authority Napa City Council Napa County Board of Supervisors   NAPA VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The committee on Napa Valley Unified School District investigated the physical condition of a number of local schools and the impact of bond monies spent over the last several years to improve the physical condition. The committee determined that the improvements made by Measure Y and Proposition 1A money were much needed and much more remains to be done. The recent bond expenditures primarily went to new roofing, heating/ventilation/air-conditioning, and electrical wiring upgrades. These were essential projects. The scope of these projects did not, however, address other important needs. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Future bond measures should contain the requirement of the appointment of oversight committees comprised of citizens who have a commitment to the improvement of the school structures. Committee members should be allowed to participate in decisions made about improvements although they should not have veto power. 2. Napa Valley Unified School District facilities remain in need of substantial repair and improvement. Some facilities are in violation of various building codes, health and safety codes and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The District appears to be aware of these problems but does not have the funds to comply with applicable code in many instances. The Board of Trustees needs to reorder its priorities in allocating the limited funds available to it and focus more on code compliance. 3. School drop-off and pick-up areas are unsafe. Plans should be made to reconfigure and enlarge these areas for the safety of the students. 4. There are problems with work orders not being addressed in a timely manner and problems that go unnoticed and unrepaired. The District should consider further staffing and naming a single employee with the primary duty of conducting frequent site inspections and checking on possible safety and health issues. BACKGROUND The Grand Jury determined that it would look into the state of local schools, primarily with an eye to the physical plant. In part, this investigation   was an analysis of the benefits obtained through Measure Y, a bond measure passed by Napa County voters in June of 1996, and Proposition 1A, a statewide ballot measure passed in 1998. Both Measure Y and Proposition 1A authorized the issuance of bonds for the purpose of repairing and modernizing schools. The text of Measure Y was as follows: ""To improve student health and safety conditions by repairing and renovating electrical, plumbing, heating, and roofing systems; and providing instructional technology infrastructure (cabling, wiring, and conduit) in classrooms, and providing handicapped accessibility as required by law; shall the Napa Valley Unified School District issue $23,1000,000 of bonds at an interest rate not exceeding the legal limit, to acquire replacement portable classrooms, and to repair and renovate classrooms and school facilities?"" Measure Y projects were proposed by NVUSD and five major categories of improvements were included: Technology Infrastructure Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning Roofing Americans With Disabilities Act Compliance Replacement of Non-conforming Buildings Measure Y Roofing projects Redwood Middle Ridgeview in the $7,485,000 $7,000,000 $4,835,000 $2,480,000 $1,300,000  projects began immediately after passage of the bond act. were completed at Bel Aire, El Centro, Phillips, Pueblo Vista, School, Napa High School, New Technology High and summer of 1996.  Summer 1997 projects included Heating Ventilation Air-Conditioning (HVAC) and electrical upgrades at Alta Heights, Bel Aire, Mt. George, Napa Junction, Pueblo Vista, Salvador, Redwood Middle School, Silverado Middle School and Napa High. Roofing projects were also completed at Donaldson Way, Shearer, Silverado Middle School and Vintage High School. A comprehensive roofing management program was implemented. Replacement and rehabilitation of non-conforming buildings was completed at Alta Heights, Browns Valley, Capell Valley, Carneros, Mt. George, Napa Junction, Napa High School and Vintage High School. In the following year, NVUSD selected Meyers Engineering Group to develop plans and specifications for technology infrastructure and those projects were completed at Bel Aire, Browns Valley, Donaldson Way, McPherson, Mt. George, Phillips, Shearer, Vichy, Redwood Middle School, Silverado Middle School, Napa High, Vintage High and Ridgeview. In addition, HVAC projects were completed at Carneros, Phillips, Snow, Vichy and West Park.   When Proposition 1A was passed by the voters in 1998, it authorized substantially more monies for school districts. Under that proposition, school districts were entitled to funds based on a 20% district share; e.g., the state would spend $4 for every $1 spent by the school district. At this point, NVUSD had expended the majority of the $23,100,000 from Measure Y but was able to obtain more than $35,000,000 from the state under Proposition 1A. This infusion of cash enabled NVUSD to undertake additional projects to improve the infrastructure of individual schools. However, despite the substantial additional monies obtained from the state, a few of the original projects proposed under Measure Y were not completed. Particularly, the Napa Valley Language Academy (formerly Westwood), Carneros and Yountville schools still require work which had been expected to be completed with the local funds. The Grand Jury recognizes that a great deal was accomplished with these funds; however, much more remains to be done. School districts have recently suffered through public aversion to bond measures or other taxing devices and most of Napa's schools were built years ago. As a result, they require more maintenance and upkeep and there is little money in the budget for such necessary work. Many of Napa's children attend schools which are substandard and the funds designated for this purpose are very limited. A. Measure Y Oversight Committee At the time Measure Y was before the voters, backers of the bond proposition made a commitment to the voting public that an oversight committee would be appointed to oversee the School District's implementation of projects contemplated under the measure. The Grand Jury was informed that this promise was intended to convince voters that the funds generated under the bond measure would be properly appropriated and expended. Following passage, an oversight committee was selected and seated. This committee was made up of fifteen members, including members of the Chamber of Commerce, representatives of the City of Napa, Napa County, the Town of Yountville, City of American Canyon and appointees from various organizations including media-appointed members, representatives of the Napa County Taxpayers Association and the Napa County Hispanic Network, along with several at-large members. It appears to the Grand Jury that this oversight committee had little or no ability to do much besides rubberstamping NVUSD projects. A Mission Statement was adopted by the committee which contained the following language:   ""The committee's actual activities will be limited to informing the public if, at any time, the School District or its employees voluntarily provide us any information which indicates the District has expended funds obtained through the sale of Measure Y Bonds in a manner violating state law that requires such expenditures to be limited to capital improvements and repairs to real property."" In other words, the only recognized responsibility of the oversight committee was to wait and see whether the School District itself, or one of its employees, voluntarily reported lack of compliance with state law. The Measure Y Interim Report stated that $600,000 of Measure Y funds had been spent on technology infrastructure at American Canyon Middle School, a school that was not in existence at the time of the passage of Measure Y and therefore should not have been entitled to funds for ""repair and renovation."" The Grand Jury has attempted to discover whether or not Measure Y funds were actually spent on American Canyon Middle School and has received various inconsistent responses. It should be noted that the Grand Jury was unable to determine whether or not those funds were expended on that school. Members of the Oversight Committee were interviewed and indicated they had requested documents from the District and the District did not provide them. In addition, members were surprised to learn that, according to the District, the Oversight Committee is still in existence although there have been no meetings for over a year. It is a testament to the futility of this committee that most of its members believe it is disbanded. B. Bid Process One of the areas in which the Oversight Committee apparently had no input was in the selection of architects and consultants for the various school projects. The Grand Jury was told that NVUSD did not select the lowest bidder for architect services on each of the remodeling projects. For instance, in December 1996, NVUSD sent out a Request for Proposal (RFP) for architect services at Salvador Elementary School, Alta Heights Elementary School and Mt. George Elementary School for their modernization projects. The low bidder for all three sites was a local architect who was not selected for any of the projects. Instead the bids went to out-of-county architects. Local Architect's Bid Salvador Alta Heights Mt. George $30,596 $71,816 $34,702 Selected Bid $38,725 $93,500 $54,500 City of Selectee Placerville San Francisco Santa Rosa   The Grand Jury was advised that the selection of these architects was based upon the firm's experience in working with state requirements for public schools and their ability to accomplish this task within short timelines to ensure the District's receipt of state funds; however the criteria for sending the RFPs to each architect was those ""architects known by reputation as being well qualified and experienced in the design and construction of public schools"" and the local architect was a recipient of an RFP. The Grand Jury is not suggesting that there was anything improper about the selection of these architects because there is no requirement that a School District accept the lowest bid when issuing RFPs involving architectural services. However, at least one of the members of the NVUSD Board of Trustees was not aware that there was a lower bid than that accepted by the District and would have raised an inquiry had that member been aware. It is clear that where there is an appearance of possible impropriety, it is most important that there be a system of checks and balances in place so that there is a reduced possibility for suspicion on the part of the citizenry. The Director of General Services and Facilities for NVUSD has agreed that it is advisable for members of any future oversight committee to be permitted to sit in on the selection process. C. Compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act The Grand Jury also directed its attention to NVUSD's compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA""). As mentioned above, nearly $2.5 million dollars was budgeted for this expense out of the Measure Y funds. As school inspections were conducted, it became clear that non-conformance was quite common. NVUSD was questioned about this and responded that the schools were allocated funds for ADA compliance based on the size and complexity of the campus and that in some cases, the amount allocated did not cover the cost of the project. NVUSD did produce a chart which listed the budgeted amount for each school for ADA compliance in amounts ranging from $0 at Capell Valley and Carneros Elementary Schools to $200,000 at Vintage High and New Tech High Schools. It is not clear how much money was actually expended from the budgeted amounts for this work. In addition, there is no indication that Proposition 1A monies were made available for this purpose. D. Site Visits As part of its investigation, members of the Grand Jury toured a number of local schools. Jurors were ordinarily accompanied by the principal or another representative and were able to discuss the facilities with administrators, teachers and parents. There is a great deal of concern and   interest among these parties with regard to the safety of the students and the availability of an atmosphere conducive to learning. At every school, the committee reviewed the facility's past and current Fire and Life Safety Reports. At each school visited, there was no evidence that the previous Report had been addressed as the current Report listed the identical findings and violations and the school remained out of compliance. Some of the schools visited were in violation of OSHA requirements. Further, the committee noted that there are no smoke alarms or sprinkler systems in the schools, although there is no state requirement that such systems be in place in school buildings. Carneros Elementary School Grand Jury members visited Carneros Elementary School. Carneros has 201 students and eleven full-time instructors. The vast majority of students do not live within the boundaries of Carneros School's District. The main bathrooms are marked for handicapped accessibility but are not accessible. They are also used for storage. Handicapped accessible bathrooms are located in a portable building. The plumbing doesn't work well. Water pressure is low. Toilets are stained with rust, apparently from very hard water. They also tend to get dirt in the pipes, causing them to back up. The custodian has filled out numerous work orders for this situation but apparently no permanent solution has been achieved. The parking lot was recently repaved but it is not large enough to accommodate the number of cars and buses transporting children to and from school. This school has a room into which all the students enter to receive their lunches. The Grand Jury was told that this room has asbestos tiles and that the students are instructed to not drag their feet in that room. This would disturb the loose cracked tiles and create a health hazard. One of the rooms is a used portable classroom brought over from Vichy Elementary School. The air vents in this room are covered in very dark dust which started shooting out of the vents when it was hooked up. The staff is concerned about the air that the children were breathing in this room and believe that the air filters should be changed more frequently than they are. The school needs repainting. Apparently ramp railings throughout the portable classrooms were painted last year but that paint is badly peeling everywhere.   There is a Quonset hut next to the classrooms in which the floor tiles are broken and the Grand Jury was asked to not kick up any dirt because the school had been warned of the asbestos. This hut is in very bad disrepair and should be replaced. The Grand Jury was also told that there had been rat problems but stray cats in the area had taken care of that problem. Mt. George Elementary School Members of the Grand Jury toured Mt. George Elementary School. There is a newly remodeled school office for staff and teachers. The remodeling required removal of the area in which the school nurse treated sick children and there is no replacement space. The handicapped parking space in the parking lot is not properly located. It is placed between two regular parking spaces. State law requires that no handicapped person using a designated parking space shall have to cross behind another automobile to access a facility. NVUSD was advised of this problem last year but has not taken any steps to resolve the violation of law. A wheelchair elevator was installed in the auditorium but it has never been operable. One of the exits from the main building opens out on a three-inch drop. Building codes do not permit this. Also, the steps are of different heights which is a further building code violation. Building codes require that ramps be equipped with rails so that persons walking down the ramp can have something to hold onto for balance. Several locations at this school do not have the required rails. Moreover, those rails are supposed to end in a half-circle so that they do not pose an injury hazard. Rails at this school end without the half-circle and simply jut out. Recently the school built new restroom facilities for teachers. However, one of them is used instead as a storage area. The bathrooms inside the main building are not handicapped accessible and it is necessary to walk down steps to enter the bathrooms. Wheelchair-bound individuals are unable to use these facilities. There are accessible bathrooms some distance from the main building. There were loose ceiling tiles in classrooms. The custodian is housed in a Quonset hut which has been declared unsafe due to asbestos. The Quonset hut is in disrepair.   Napa High School Grand Jury members inspected Napa High School. The staff was pleasant, cooperative and knowledgeable. There are 2200 students, 60% Caucasian and 36% Hispanic. There are 167 instructors. There are complaints of heating and air-conditioning not working. Complaints of frigid to very hot temperatures have been an ongoing problem which has not been remedied by the District. The school has some electrical problems. One room has electricity on one side of the room only. The library has a wiring problem in that extension cords are necessary to use electric equipment. Bathrooms for female teachers are in short supply. The Grand Jury was advised that there are often lines waiting to use the bathrooms. In addition, there are no locks on the bathroom doors. The girls' bathroom in the gym has a hanging stall door. There was a complaint that telephones in the woodshop and the library are too far from the workstations. Mold is a common complaint. Several teachers complained that they believed their health was being jeopardized by the mold. Many of the newer modular classrooms have peeling paint. The trim was not properly primed. One wing of the school has numerous roof leaks related to HVAC units and recent modernization. Now the faculty is waiting for the roof to be repaired again. The Grand Jury was advised that rain was literally dripping on students recently as they took their SAT examinations. There is a noted frustration from the staff with respect to the lack of remedies for these problems. The Grand Jury was told that the maintenance department does not respond to work orders in a timely fashion, communication is poor and there is no notification when the requested repair work is completed. Staff also complained about the lack of respect for the academic environment at the school. Phillips Edison Elementary School Members of the Grand Jury visited Phillips Edison Partnership School. This school was selected for inspection because of positive publicity and academic achievement. Each classroom has student greeters who instantly arise when visitors arrive in the classroom and introduce themselves.   Although the scores are among the lowest in the county, testing shows that the school is meeting goals and advancing rapidly. There are 570 students in attendance. One modular bathroom was locked and unusable. The interior was moldy and in disrepair. One of the classrooms had a water leak which had been investigated by NVUSD maintenance but not repaired. The kitchen had friable asbestos floor tile and mold around the sink. The kitchen doubles as an office for the fitness and health teacher. There is a handicapped elevator in the auditorium for raising wheelchairbound children to the stage; however, it does not work properly. The east boundary of the school is next to a small creek. A fence is in place to protect the children from the creek but the fence has been bent up at several locations and it is quite easy for a student to get under the fence. This is a major concern to the staff and parents. Redwood Middle School Members of the Grand Jury visited Redwood Middle School. There are 2200 students at this facility. There appears to be good parent participation at this school. Staff and parents do a lot of work on their own. A local artist painted a facade for the front of the building at the Parents' Club's expense. Lockers need to be replaced. Apparently the current lockers have been in use since 1956 and are in a state of disrepair. The handicapped elevator to the stage was functional. The Grand Jury was told that there was a problem with cleanliness after recent construction work. Apparently the contractor had not cleaned up after completion of the project. The custodian's office is an old trailer with a hole in the window. The stage wall needs to be painted. The custodian is not allowed to paint and NVUSD doesn't see it as a concern. The Grand Jury was informed that NVUSD's maintenance department does not respond quickly to requests/work orders. There is a work order that has been outstanding for over a year without response.   There are leaks in the roof and work orders have been submitted. Shearer Elementary School Grand Jury members inspected Shearer Elementary School, another of the older NVUSD schools. As opposed to other schools, Shearer is a depressing site. The hallways are dark, the classroom curtains were stained and loosely hanging, the atmosphere uninviting. Roofing was completed prior to the use of Measure Y/Proposition IA monies. All heating, venting and air-conditioning has been completed. Technical infrastructure has been finished also. The bathrooms are antiquated and those marked as handicapped accessible were not. There was a portable bathroom which was accessible to the handicapped but it was a distance from the main building. The Grand Jury was told that NVUSD ran out of money to modernize the bathrooms. The playground area was new and inviting. The library area seemed to just have been thrown together and the computer room appeared to be a large open closet next to the library area. A bookshelf separates the library from the hallway. Silverado Middle School Members of the Grand Jury toured Silverado Middle School. Silverado has a population of nearly 1000 students and approximately 60 teachers. The roof leaks in one of the wings and paint is falling off the wall. The female staff bathrooms are portable bathrooms located outside of the school buildings. Several fire extinguishers were absent from the wall holders and some of the holders are broken. Asbestos was found in three of the Quonset huts, two of which were open and accessible to anyone. Each of the three huts had friable tiles. It is also possible that the kitchen has asbestos tiles. There is a possibility that the Quonset huts have lead-based paint which is particularly harmful to children. The Grand Jury was told that the paint had not been tested to determine whether or not it was lead-based. Although students do not ordinarily use these Quonset huts, it is possible to spread the lead-based paint via teachers or staff who might go to the hut, get paint chips   on their shoes and then carry these chips to other parts of the campus where they might be ingested by the children. The female locker rooms had extensive mold around the showers and the lockers are rusted and broken. The male locker rooms had broken lockers and out-of-order urinals. The showers in the male locker rooms are unavailable to the students and are being used for storage. There has been a long-standing problem with the sprinklers between A wing and the administration office in that the sprinklers come on every day even on weekends. Constant mud is a consequence. There is mold on the overhang of A wing of which the NVUSD maintenance department was not aware. When advised of this situation, the Department did take a sample of the mold to have it analyzed. The painting at the school is haphazard. The school wanted a mural saved on the Kennedy Hall stage but it was spray-painted. The painters left supplies when they finished the job and paint cans from the job remain behind the stage. The parking lot is inadequate. It is small and congested as is the dropoff area. Additional space is needed for parking and picking up/dropping off students. Snow Elementary School Members of the Grand Jury toured Snow Elementary School. There are 350 students, 3 of whom are in wheelchairs. The bathrooms are in excellent condition after having been remodeled in August 2000 and are all handicapped accessible. All Measure Y and Proposition 1A work has been completed. The school is very clean and looks nearly new with bright hallways and classrooms. Each of the classrooms has an outside telephone line, even the portable classrooms. There are no reported plumbing problems. There is no lunchroom. The hallway is set up each day for a lunch space. The primary concern appears to be with the landscaping. There are a lot of bushes in front of the school which need to be removed because the school is downhill from the road and is hard to see from the road. With the landscape   presently in place, it is hard to monitor the school so there are occasional break-ins and thefts. Vichy Elementary School Grand Jury members toured Vichy Elementary School. The staff was cooperative, pleasant and knowledgeable. Classrooms were brightly decorated and the school was clean. There is an active and participatory parent club. The new playground was provided by the parents' club, community service, Kiwanis Club and NVUSD and is attractive. The primary bathrooms have not been updated. The Grand Jury was told that no remodeling had taken place because the school would have to make the restrooms compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act which was apparently too costly. One of the classrooms has a large brown leak mark on the ceiling. The building needs to be painted. A ""ball wall"" used by older students needs to be replaced. Although the parent club has the money for this project, it needs to be earthquake retrofitted which has delayed the project. The multi-purpose room is newly painted with new floor tiles and ceiling. It serves as a lunchroom but can only hold about one-half of the students. The staff is concerned that the lighting in the parking lot is inadequate for nighttime activities. This is a safety issue. Westwood Elementary School (Napa Valley Language Academy) Members of the Grand Jury toured Westwood School, now a charter school known as Napa Valley Language Academy. This school was built in 1947 and is one of the oldest schools in the District. It is an immersion school and must have an equal number of English/Spanish speaking students. Sixtyfive percent (65%) of the school is Hispanic. There are approximately 600 students and 36 teachers. One student is in a wheelchair. As a charter school, the Academy has a unique admission policy. Enrollment is open to all with preference given to siblings of current students. A five-year commitment is expected from the parents. There is an enrollment lottery. Westwood was one of the first schools in the District to be retrofitted with air-conditioning and heating. Because of that, when Measure Y passed, the   school was placed at the bottom of the list with regard to upgrading technology and accessible bathrooms. During the summer of 2001, Measure Y technology infrastructure (cable wiring and conduit) was completed. However, the computers then in place are not compatible with the advanced technology and need to be upgraded. The architect hired by NVUSD for the remainder of the Measure Y renovation apparently was late with its plans and as a result further modernization and handicapped accessibility could not be completed. The school does not know when further monies will be available to complete the needed changes. One of the primary concerns of the school was the lack of telephones in the classrooms. There is one phone with outside line capability for the 36 teachers and no private area in which to call parents, etc. There is no means of communication from the classroom to the outside although a teacher can call to the main office from the classroom. There is also concern about the response time when a call for services is made to the NVUSD Maintenance Department. There was a work order that had been in since the previous school year which had not yet been addressed. The Grand Jury was told that emergency work requests are responded to within two or three days but routine requests take weeks to address. The bathroom sinks and toilets are inappropriate in size for the older students. Plumbing is rusted. There was no hot water for washing. The bathrooms were not handicapped accessible as required by law. Bathrooms for the older students were unsanitary, unpainted and moldy. There was insufficient office space. One of the offices was a converted closet. Not only are the rooms small but there is inadequate storage space so that the offices are cluttered with books and other materials. The school attempts to store things in two rusted Quonset huts which contained old desks, reams of paper, etc., much of it soggy and of little value. The roofs in the huts were decaying and the sky was visible from within. The Grand Jury was advised that rats had been seen in the vicinity and the huts smelled like a litter box. In comparison, the school library was clean, bright, attractive and comfortable. While it is in its original building, it has been refurbished by state library funds. Library assistants are paid for by ""stock options"" provided by a parent. There are two instructional clerks and the library is able to remain open until 4 p.m. PROCEDURES The Grand Jury met with the following individuals:   Superintendent of Schools Assistant Superintendent of Schools Administrator of General Services Members of the NVUSD School Board Members of the Measure Y Oversight Committee The Grand Jury also visited fourteen schools and interviewed principals, teachers, custodians and parents. The Grand Jury reviewed a number of documents including: Minutes of the Board of Education Meetings School Accountability Report Cards Capital Improvement Program Final Draft Measure Y/Proposition 1A Summary Report Measure Y Oversight Committee Interim Report Evaluation 2001 Base Academic Performance Construction Contracts Fire and Life Safety Reports FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Finding 1 The Measure Y Oversight Committee was designed as a committee without authority. Its Mission Statement admitted that its sole activity was to wait to see if the School District reported itself for violation of state law. The committee was so powerless that members no longer showed up for meetings and were surprised to learn that the committee had not been disbanded. Recommendation 1 Oversight Committees are recommended for future bond measures. These committees must have more right to participate in bond projects, including the right to be present for interviews with architects/consultants/contractors, the right to review all documents and the prerogative to write their own Interim Report. Oversight Committee members should be appointed by the Napa County Board of Supervisors and/or city councils of schools within the District. Response Requested from Superintendent of Schools Napa Valley Unified School District Board of Trustees   Finding 2 There are numerous violations of Health and Safety codes, building codes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and continued non-compliance with annual Fire and Life Safety Reports. Recommendation 2a NVUSD should improve awareness of the condition of the schools. There are existing parent-teacher organizations at each school which should be encouraged to take a more active role in inspecting the school and reporting safety hazards or other substandard conditions to the District. Response Requested from Superintendent of Schools Napa Valley Unified School District Board of Trustees Recommendation 2b NVUSD must find ways to provide adequate facilities for all of the students. The Board of Trustees should reorder its priorities in apportioning the limited funds it controls to improve the physical plant of the District. Response Requested from Superintendent of Schools Napa Valley Unified School District Board of Trustees Finding 3 Student drop-off areas are dangerous. One principal stated that dropoffs and pick-ups were the scariest parts the day. These areas are too small and not configured for modern traffic. Recommendation 3 The drop-off areas must be reconfigured and enlarged. The schools have more than adequate acreage to accomplish this. Response Requested from Superintendent of Schools Napa Valley Unified School District Board of Trustees Napa Police Department Napa County Sheriff's Department   Finding 4 School facilities are too small. Lunchrooms, teachers' meeting rooms and auditoriums are all inadequate for the present student population. Recommendation 4 See Recommendation 2b. Response Requested from Superintendent of Schools Napa Valley Unified School District Board of Trustees Finding 5 There seems to be unwarranted delay in responding to and completing work orders from the schools to the District. Recommendation 5 See Recommendation 4. Response Requested from Superintendent of Schools Napa Valley Unified School District Board of Trustees Finding 6 The District's maintenance department was not aware of a number of problems found by the Grand Jury during its site visits. When advised of the problems, the Department responded quickly and appropriately. The lack of knowledge of the conditions at some schools or perhaps the lack of concern is indicative of a breakdown in communications. Recommendation 6 NVUSD should have further staffing and an employee whose primary duty is to conduct frequent school inspections and meet on a regular basis with school principals to inquire about conditions. This employee should also be knowledgeable about lead-based paint in the school buildings and the presence of asbestos.   Response Requested from Superintendent of Schools Napa Valley Unified School District Board of Trustees   PLANNING  NAPA COUNTY The Grand Jury reviewed the operations of the Napa County Conservation, Development and Planning Department, from the time of the resignation of the previous planning director and the permanent appointment of the interim planning director March 2001 to March 2002. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS Finding 1 The Napa County Planning Director has undertaken a Herculean task to correct as serious a problem as Napa County has faced. He has replaced lost staff, reinstated process and made excellent progress. The County Executive Officer and the Board of Supervisor (while probably late) have given him the support and funds to do the job. The NCCDPD is once again a part of the team serving all of Napa County's residents. Commendation The Planning Director is commended by the Grand Jury for his leadership in the Department. Finding 2 The Board of Supervisors is acting responsibly in refusing to allow housing on prime agricultural soils or in environmentally unacceptable locations. Finding 3 The process of environmental review of projects with the potential of causing harmful erosion (in part, new vineyards and replants) should continue to be improved so that critics are comfortable that the process ensures protection of the environment and property owners are assured that there is a process. The recent agreement for the Suscol Springs Vineyard Conversion Project (March) between critics of the process, property owners, and the Department is a foundation for putting this problem behind the County. BACKGROUND In March 2001 the Napa County Planning Director resigned, having held the office for 14 years and was replaced by first an interim Planning Director on   March 27, 2001 and then a permanent Planning Director on June 12, 2001. When the outgoing Planning Director left the office: 1. There were a great number of applications for use permits on file, many of which were more than six months old and had not even had a planner assigned to process them. 2. There were a great number of applications for certificates of compliance which had been on file for more than two years, had not been acted upon, and were not being processed. There were a great number of applications for lot line adjustments referred by the Department of Public Works which had not been acted upon and were not being processed. There were 140 applications pending for agricultural erosion control plans which had not been acted upon, the majority of which had been pending for 12-24 months, and of which 41 were not even on the Planning Department's list. Very few were being processed. There were 63 applications pending for structural erosion control plans which had not been acted upon, the majority of which had been pending for 12-18 months. Before the change in Planning Directors, the Conservation, Development and Planning Department was divided into two divisions, Planning and Building Inspection. The Planning Division was authorized 13 Planning positions including the Deputy Planning Director, of which 4 were not filled. In April 2001, 2 planners terminated employment. In May 2001, the Deputy Planning Director announced his decision to retire affective August 3rd bringing the total number of vacant positions to be filled to 7. Of the 7 vacant positions, 6 were staff planners, which left 6 planners to do the work. Napa County was in litigation over the adequacy of the Environmental Impact Report for the 1998 Airport Specific Plan. The County lost in the trial court and lost in the District Court of Appeal. The County was also in litigations with the Sierra Club over the alleged lack of environmental review of vineyards requiring Erosion Control permits. There was a lack of co-operation between the Department and the rest of the departments of the County. The morale of the Planning Department staff was poor.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8. 9.   The Napa County General Plan Housing Element does not comply with housing requirements established by the State Department of Housing and Community Development and its Councils of Government (in our case the Association of Bay Area Governments more commonly known as ABAG). The State Office of Planning and Research (more commonly known as OPR) lists the Napa County General Plan as ""not comprehensively updated"", which means that 5 of the 7 mandatory elements of the General Plan have not been updated in the last 10 years. As of March 11, 2002, 12 months later, the Planning Division of the Conservation, Development and Planning Director was reorganized into two divisions, the Planning Division and the Conservation Division with the allocation of a new Deputy Planning Director position to head the Conservation Division. In addition, the Board approved the Planning Director's request to add two Principal Planner positions, and a Planning Tech position as part of Final Budget Actions in June 2001. All vacant position were subsequently filled by the end of 2001. The added position of Planning Technician now allows the public counter to be staffed for the entire business day, rather than the previous limitation of noon-5 p.m. Perhaps the greatest problem facing the people of Napa County in generations is the conflict between two desirable goals, both recognized state wide and nationally. One is the preservation of prime agricultural lands and the other is the zoning for, and construction of, housing. Both goals must be met in an environmentally satisfactory manner. The Housing Element of the Napa County General Plan is inadequate and cannot be made adequate without jeopardizing prime agricultural lands. The Board of Supervisors and the City Councils of the City of Napa and the City of American Canyon know the problem and have told the public they intend to deal with the problem. If they do not, they will subject the County (and its taxpayers which are mostly residents of the Cities) to litigation which the County cannot win, and to sanctions from the State of California which will work to the detriment of all of Napa County's citizens. Napa County must meet its share of California's housing need. Napa County must preserve its prime agricultural lands and protect the environment. Lands that are not prime agricultural lands need to be annexed to the City of Napa and the City of American Canyon for housing. State legislation is needed to allow Napa County credit for past and future annexations for housing to the City of American Canyon and future annexations to the City of Napa. The County should be looked at by the State as ""one"" with its cities and not as an entity required to provide housing. Another serious problem facing the people of Napa County is the planting of new vineyards only after compliance with the California Environmental   Quality Act. The Conservation, Development and Planning Department, the Conservation, Development and Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors need to identify which new plantings are entitled to categorical exemptions, which are entitled to negative declarations or mitigated negative declarations, and which will be required to prepare environmental impact reports. Critics of previous County activities need to be satisfied with the process. PROCEDURES The Grand Jury committees interviewed the Planning Director, planners, Napa County Supervisors, Napa City Council members and staff, City of American Canyon Council members and staff, and applicants for use permits, certificates of compliance, lot line adjustments, structural erosion control plans, and agricultural erosion control plans. Finding 1 The Napa County Planning Director has undertaken a Herculean task to correct as serious problem as Napa County has faced. He has replaced lost staff, reinstated process and made excellent progress. The County Executive Officer and the Board of Supervisor (while probably late) have given him the support and funds to do the job. The NCCDPD is once again a part of the team serving all of Napa County's residents. Commendation The Planning Director is commended by the Grand Jury for his leadership in the Department. Finding 2 The Board of Supervisors is acting responsibly in refusing to allow housing on prime agricultural soils or in environmentally unacceptable locations. Recommendation 2 The Board of Supervisors must subordinate past differences with the Cities and direct staff to come up with a housing solution that is reasonable and avoids State imposed sanctions. The Board should enlist the assistance of its representatives in the State Assembly and State Senate with legislation that enables the County to comply with State housing requirements and preserves prime agricultural lands.   Response Requested From Napa County Board of Supervisors City Council City of American Canyon City Council City of Napa Finding 3 The process of environmental review of projects with the potential of causing harmful erosion (in part, new vineyards and replants) should continue to be improved so that critics are comfortable that the process ensures protection of the environment and property owners are assured that there is a process. The recent agreement for the Suscol Springs Vineyard Conversion Project (March) between critics of the process, property owners, and the Department is a foundation for putting this problem behind the County. Recommendation The Department should continue to attempt to build a process that is satisfactory to both critics and property owners and protects the environment from projects with the potential for harmful erosion. Response Requested From Napa County Conservation Development County Planning Department and Commission   SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The committee on Special Needs Housing investigated the extent of homelessness in Napa County and the response of various City of Napa, County of Napa and non-profit agencies to the problem. The investigation led to an examination of the county's Continuum of Care organization. This group is made up of local government and non-profit agencies who deal with homelessness by planning strategies and helping to decide where grant monies would best be used. The committee also visited all of the major homeless shelters in Napa County. Of primary concern was the adequacy of the shelters in housing the large number of homeless persons. The effects of homelessness on Napa's social services as well as emergency services were considered. The committee is aware that many of the identified homeless population are homeless by choice rather than by circumstance and that efforts made on their behalf may well prove fruitless. However, the committee believes that efforts to rehabilitate this population and assimilate them back into the community are, overall, necessary and worthwhile. The availability of low-cost housing as a resolution to homelessness led to review of the City of Napa's current housing element. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 1. The Sullivan Shelter must be replaced. Fulfillment of Napa's Master Plan will require moving the downtown single adult shelter which is presently using a condemned county building. The replacement of this shelter with a larger permanent shelter is priority #1. 2. The Family Shelter (Samaritan House) on Old Sonoma Road will accommodate seven (7) families at a time. Many families with children on the waiting list for Samaritan House are housed in local motels at taxpayers' expense. The expansion of Samaritan Shelter, or the development of additional family shelters, is priority #2. 3. The winter homeless shelter located on the grounds of the former California Department of Forestry (CDF) facility on Jefferson Street is no longer available because a senior housing project is slated to be built on that site. A new site needs to be located for the winter shelter   prior to the onset of cold weather in 2002. The appropriate city/county agencies should set aside sufficient funds to qualify for state/federal matching funds. Commendations The Grand Jury commends the steering committee of the 2001 Napa City Housing Element for the excellent work they did in producing a comprehensive and socially supportive document. The Grand Jury also commends the individual efforts by members of the Continuum of Care for their ongoing work to resolve homelessness in Napa County. BACKGROUND The 2001-2002 Grand Jury formed a committee to investigate special needs housing. ""Special needs"" is meant to encompass those individuals who have pre-existing difficulties or circumstances that would make finding affordable housing an even more daunting task than the average citizen already faces. The committee took into consideration:         Housing needs for seniors living on a low fixed income. Persons with mental and physical disabilities. Those who are terminally ill with no certain residence. Physically abused women (with or without children) who have given up residences to gain safety. Runaway youth. Persons released from mental health facilities or jail without living arrangements. Persons awaiting admittance to the Veterans Home; and Those unable to care for themselves because of drug and alcohol problems.  Napa County provides a spectrum of services from emergency shelters through transitional housing to permanent supported housing. These services are provided within a continuum of care system under the umbrella of local government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and faith-based groups. The dedication of individuals involved in these efforts cannot be overstated, and they are a credit to our community. Their selfless contributions to humanity are worthy of emulation. Special Needs Housing and related services represent ongoing concerns that cannot be addressed without concerted community   interest and action. It is in that spirit that findings and recommendations are made. After much discussion and several interviews the committee decided to narrow the scope of its investigation to the single largest group of individuals needing Specialized Housing - the Homeless. There are hundreds of homeless in the Napa Valley. Some sources estimate 800 plus. The Napa Police Department has a listing of 563 homeless within the Napa city limits alone, and their number does not include those in shelters or those without police contact. It is critical to bear in mind that these statistics represent a daily estimate and the actual number of homeless on an annual basis are presumed to be significantly larger. Causes of Homelessness: The causes of homelessness are as varied as the homeless people themselves. The two leading causes however are a shortage of affordable rental housing and an increase in poverty. In recent years the rents have gone up, public assistance has gone down (1996 welfare reform), and the minimum wage continues to be insufficient. A person making minimum wage in Napa would need to work 80 hours a week, and pay half of their monthly income to rent a one bedroom house. A disabled person on SSI cannot rent either an apartment or a house without help. It was a shock to the Grand Jury to learn that 60% of those living in Sullivan and Samaritan shelters are employed but unable to earn enough money to afford shelter. In addition, since September 11 and the economic downturn, there were, as of the time this report was written, 24 (twenty-four) families staying in motels after losing their housing. Napa County's Health and Human Services pays for these motel beds. According to that agency, 90% of its General Assistance budget (over $400,000) is spent for temporary lodging in motels and one-time grants to persons seeking shelter. Mental Illness is another contributing factor, as 25% to 30% of the homeless have some form of persistent mental illness. The majority of these people can successfully function in society with supportive housing. Domestic Violence is another leading cause of putting mothers and their children on the streets. According to Napa Emergency Women's Shelter, 150 were guests at NEWS in 2001. One hundred of these were children. Many women choose homelessness over living in an abusive relationship.   Drug and Alcohol Abuse is certainly a symptom, as well as a cause of homelessness. As will be detailed further, substance abusers are a major cause of police activity among this population. Notwithstanding the high incidence of drug and alcohol use among the homeless, only a small minority of anti-social homeless prefer the street life over shelter and treatment. In many cases some individuals didn't use drugs until introduced to them on the streets. The City of Napa has responded to this homelessness crisis by agreeing to continue to provide funds for existing organizations which provide shelter for the homeless, and further to assist in the acquisition of existing facilities that can be converted to expand emergency shelters for homeless families and single persons with special needs. The City's objective is to expand existing shelters including acquisition of site and construction of permanent shelter through Community Development Block Grant monies with a five-year goal of permanent emergency shelters for 35 single men, 20 women and 20 families. Given the apparent need for shelter, these numbers may be quite inadequate by the time the five years have run. Continuum of Care The Continuum of Care refers to a community-wide assessment of homeless needs, existing resources to meet those needs and strategies to help the homeless which the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development requires that local communities conduct in order to compete for HUD funds. In order for Federal and State provide sufficient and knowledge to our community to assist the Nonprofit Community access funds for Special Needs Housing, the community needs to funds to fund grant writers who possess the necessary skill understand matching requirements for these funds.  In part, the Continuum of Care is comprised of a number of separate non-profit agencies that provide housing and services to very low income residents. These agencies receive Community Development Block Grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development by way of contracts with the Napa County Department of Health and Human Services. One of the ongoing projects is identification of the homeless population most in need of expanded services in Napa. A specific project identified the chronic homeless, as well as those with mental illness and/or drug and alcohol issues. That process identified three services that were needed to address the problems of this group: 1) expanded outreach; 2) a day resource center; and 3) detox/residential treatment. An outreach worker was hired, the HOPE Resource Center opened in October of 2001 and a Detox/Residential Center will open around May 1, 2002.   Napa Valley Coalition of Non-Profit Agencies Napa County is fortunate to have a number of non-profit agencies which are focused on the needs of the population which is homeless or at risk for homelessness. The Napa Valley Coalition of Non-Profit Agencies was formed as a merger of several topical working groups. This broad-based organization includes most of the County's nonprofits and local government bodies concerned with homelessness, affordable housing, and poverty issues, and has been a highly effective leadership body in catalyzing community action to meet pressing human needs. One of the more effective is Community Action Napa Valley (CANV) which operates several shelters. Community Action Napa Valley The general homeless facility, known as the Sullivan Shelter, is located in downtown Napa. It is a large, somewhat dilapidated building in need of repair. The shelter has 38 beds and it is almost always full, with a waiting list for those who arrive when it is full. Napa County residents have priority over nonresidents. The maximum stay at this shelter is 28 days at one time, with a maximum of 84 days in a 12-month period. This shelter opens at 5:30 p.m. and is little more than a place to sleep. It is open all day on Sundays yearround, and on Saturdays during the cold and wet months. There are showers, a telephone and modest kitchen facilities. At the time of the grand jury's visit to the Sullivan Shelter, it was apparent that the guests of that facility had a good rapport with the staff. This was not a depressed group, although the surroundings are somewhat cheerless. The interior is little more than a number of beds, each in close proximity to the next. There is no privacy nor much room to store possessions. It is somewhat similar to military barracks without the spit-shine cleanliness and uniformity. The persons availing themselves of the use of this facility must be drug and alcohol free and are required to be taking steps to become self-sufficient and obtain their own shelter. It was sobering to discover that many working people in Napa County are unable to afford a place to live. Staff at the Sullivan Shelter are trained to coach the population toward self-sufficiency by helping them identify barriers to employment and housing and assisting them in developing a plan to address those barriers. A Housing Counselor works actively to assist the clients in finding transitional and permanent housing. Those in drug and alcohol programs are given support to continue their programs The grand jury has been advised that this shelter space, which is owned by the County, will be closing soon because the County has other plans for the space. It is an extremely high priority of this grand jury that a replacement facility be found and dedicated to this population. Due to the existing need, it   is recommended that the replacement facility be able to accommodate at least double the number that are currently served. In addition to the Sullivan Shelter, CANV also manages a shelter for homeless families, known as the Samaritan Family Center. This facility stands in stark contrast to Sullivan, best illustrated by the design. Samaritan can house up to seven families at a time; there are seven large bedrooms with modest amenities. However, the remainder of the shelter is all common area, including a large kitchen with several stoves, refrigerators and sinks, a common dining area, common sitting rooms and a large, comfortable area with several computer terminals. Unlike the Sullivan Shelter, the Samaritan is open all day long and is staffed continuously. Upon entry into this program, guests are required to agree to a plan for self-sufficiency and they are monitored to assure compliance. One of the means by which the guests learn to fend for themselves is by depositing 60% of their income into a fund which they will then use to put down on rent and a deposit after their stay at the shelter terminates. A family can stay at this shelter for up to three months. There is a long waiting list for admittance and the majority of those families waiting are housed in local motels as Napa County has a policy that no child shall be without shelter. Of course, this results in a substantial cost to the county on an annual basis. In addition, there is a homeless shelter for use in the wintertime for those persons who don't wish to use, or are barred from, the Sullivan shelter. This shelter is located at the site of the old California Department of Forestry facilities on Jefferson Street and is for persons eighteen years and older. It exists as a last resort for those in danger of sleeping in the freezing weather and it also serves as a shelter for the overflow from a full Sullivan shelter. The rules regarding active use of drugs and/or alcohol are not as rigidly enforced. This site will be unavailable and a new shelter needs to be arranged before next winter comes. Newly opened this year is a facility known as the HOPE Resource Center which is a block away from the Sullivan Shelter. HOPE Center is a day facility for the homeless which provides showers, phones, mail service, laundry and similar services. The targeted population is the chronic street homeless, many of whom are mentally ill or have drug/alcohol problems; however it is available to any homeless adult including those at the shelters if they choose to avail themselves of the services. The site also provides medical services, legal aid, mental health programs and job development. It is located on the grounds of a church and is fully staffed. This facility is intended to supplement the Sullivan Shelter and provide those in need of shelter with additional means to achieve self-sufficiency. The staff is trained to assist those persons who have outstanding minor arrest warrants which need to be cleared so that they can find gainful employment. Persons with more serious warrants for crimes against persons and property, etc., are refused admission and HOPE Center   advises law enforcement of their presence in the community. There are also several computer terminals at which the clients can get information about employment and training opportunities. This facility is a bright and cheerful place and is a welcome addition to the homeless services programs. HOPE Resource Center was opened in October of 2001 and by December the daily attendance had more than doubled. During that three-month period employment was found for over fifty homeless people and many individuals were enrolled into mental health, day treatment or residential treatment. HOPE Center holds great promise for the community in recruiting the homeless and reconnecting them with society. Napa Emergency Women's Services (NEWS) Napa Emergency Women's Services (NEWS) operates a women's shelter specifically for victims of domestic violence. Its facility can house six families with a maximum capacity of sixteen. In 2001, approximately 150 clients used the NEWS shelter of which 100 were children. The average stay is thirty to sixty days. The greatest need of those persons exiting the NEWS shelter is, as with all other shelter graduates, affordable housing. Hospice of Napa Valley Hospice of Napa Valley is a fully licensed and certified nonprofit organization that has been serving our community since 1979. Hospice is designed to serve the terminally ill and their families, provide comprehensive services to meet individual patient needs and up to 13 months of bereavement counseling to families after the death of their loved ones. They have no current in patient facility, but a housing component is planned for their proposed new facility which will accommodate 12 patients. Patients are referred by an attending physician to hospice and services by registered nurses, social workers, home health aides, chaplains, bereavement counselors and volunteers are provided to meet the physical and emotional needs of the patient and family. In 2001, 413 patients were served by Hospice of Napa Valley. Hospice services are paid for by Medicare, Med-Cal, private insurance, grants and charitable contributions. No one is denied care because of inability to pay or lack of insurance. Patients served span the spectrum from the very young to the elderly. Hospice of Napa Valley received national recognition in 2001. The Circle of Life Awards Committee awarded a Citation of Honor for their innovation and commitment to end-of-life care. More than 100 organizations were evaluated, but only nine programs were honored. Also, the Napa Chamber of Commerce named the Executive Director of Hospice of Napa Valley, Sarah Gorodezky, its Health Professional of the Year for 2001.   Senior Housing Project A 78-unit housing project for low income seniors is projected for 2003 at the site of the former California Department of Forestry (CDF) facility on Jefferson Street. There will be 1 two-bedroom unit for an on-site manager, and 77 one-bedroom units for other tenants. Clients cannot have an income greater than $20,000 dollars per year (from all sources) and will pay no more than 30% of their income for rent. Napa Valley Community Housing, an independent non-profit agency, is the lead agency for this endeavor. The cost for this project is expected to exceed 11 million dollars and includes federal, state and local funds. Skyline Project The Progress Foundation is the lead agency for the 19 unit housing project which will serve disabled individuals. The 13 one-bedroom and 6 twobedroom units will be located on state property adjacent to but outside the Napa State Hospital perimeter. These housing units will enable clients to function on an independent basis within our community. The Skyline Project is being paid for by a grant from Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and local Housing Trust Fund dollars. Construction will probably begin in the fall of 2002. Napa Valley Residential Stabilization Center As mentioned earlier, one of the root causes of homelessness is substance abuse. For some time, Napa County has been without a detoxification center which would allow abusers a place to withdraw from alcohol and drugs. The Napa County Drug and Alcohol Committee determined that most people in Napa County who need detoxification and short-term residential substance abuse treatment services cannot get them. In a study conducted by the Health and Human Services Department, it was noted that hundreds of people are booked into the Napa County Jail because they are under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. Local hospital emergency rooms are frequently called upon to treat people dealing with substance abuse problems for which no treatment alternatives are available. The Emergency Psychiatric Response Unit at Napa County Health & Human Services regularly assesses people who are suffering from problems associated with alcoholism and drug addiction. Local outpatient treatment programs, such as Nuestra Esperanza, and Health & Human Services' two outpatient facilities found that new clients often failed to maintain a clean and sober lifestyle because they are unable to refrain from use and stabilize their lives when receiving treatment on an outpatient basis. Thus, the idea of establishing a ""stabilization center"" was born.   County officials and community leaders determined that Napa County has a growing problem of chronic homelessness. A study conducted by a task force of community representatives, service providers, and government officials concluded that a program should be established in Napa County to provide local individuals with a facility for residential detoxification services. A range of services will be provided, including varying program lengths and specific services based upon individual need. A ""step-down"" program will be offered, including inpatient care with follow-up and aftercare provided on an evening and weekend basis for those re-entering the workforce. It was decided to create the Napa Valley Residential Stabilization Center, a residential facility for adults suffering from serious chemical dependency. After discussion, it was determined that Community Action Napa Valley (Nuestra Esperanza) would be the lead agency, and partner with Our Family, Inc., which has offered drug and alcohol residential treatment services in Napa County for adults and adolescents for over 30 years. Thus, creating a culturally sensitive, professionally managed three-track residential facility. The center will offer three distinct, but closely coordinated services. First, a ten-bed short-term detoxification track for those persons needing close supervision and monitoring during the brief period that they are undergoing physical withdrawal from substance abuse. This is a critical time and requires 24-hour supervision with regular checks by qualified, professional staff. It is anticipated that the average length of stay in the detoxification unit will be two to seven days. Second, a ten-bed, short-term residential treatment program will be offered to those persons unable to stay sober without a period of intensive, structured, residential treatment. This service will be operated by Our Family, Inc. Services in this unit will be provided in English, however Spanish speaking clients will also be able to participate because of the close collaboration with CANV's Nuestra Esperanza which will operate the detoxification program and the third service element, a ten-bed, short-term residential program for Spanish speaking people. It is estimated that the program will serve a minimum of 500 persons per year in the residential detoxification track, 120 persons per year in the 30 day, short-term track, and 40 persons per year in the Spanish language stabilization track. The center will be situated on the grounds of Napa State Hospital. A facility has been identified, renovated and will be leased to the County of Napa which will in turn contract with Community Action Napa Valley (CANV) and Our Family, Inc. for operation of the program. Monies to operate this project have been allocated by Napa County and the Wine Auction. A first year operating budget is being prepared at this time and it is estimated that it will cost over one million dollars to start and operate this program in the first year. It is anticipated that the Stabilization Center will be opened this year. The building has been renovated, the program is being developed, staff is being   recruited, and preparation is underway to have it licensed and certified by the State of California. This is an example of collaboration between county officials, agency representatives, Napa State Hospital leadership and the professional community. Napa Police Department The Napa Police Department also has a keen interest in homelessness. For the last two years, they have been keeping statistics and monitoring the number of service calls for homeless-related problems. The Department has striven to recognize the efforts being made by other organizations to help the homeless while at the same time providing a strong law enforcement presence when the need arises. They have developed a strategic plan which covers the areas of outreach, enforcement, interagency communication and the collection of research data. According to the Napa Police Department, four persons identified as homeless died during 2001, two of whom died of illness (diabetes and hepatitis) after being placed in nursing homes, one of multiple drug ingestion and one of a heart attack. The Department also noted a number of serious crimes attributable to individuals in the homeless population, primarily property crimes, as well as crimes against the homeless. According to the 2001 report, there were 1,939 calls for service last year for incidents involving the homeless, an increase of slightly over 20% from the previous year. These calls for service resulted in 333 arrests (a 6.7% increase) and 62 citations (about 40% less than the previous year). Citations for drinking, trespass and camping decreased significantly from 2000 to 2001. The Department also kept statistical information on the demographics of the homeless population, indicating that 87% of the homeless population are white, with 65% being white males. According to this report, there were 563 homeless people in Napa in 2001. The statistics compiled also revealed that the age range for the homeless was as low as 13 years of age (a runaway female from another state) to an 87-year-old man. It was clear from the summary provided by the police report that drug and alcohol use, together with mental health problems, abound among the homeless. The report identified 169 homeless people who suffer from mental illness but found that the majority is capable of caring for themselves and have relatively minor problems. The problems in this population arise when they stop taking their prescription medication. It was clear from the report that most calls for service are generated by a small sample of the homeless. The NPD report singled out four individuals with mental health problems who were, by themselves, responsible for 120 calls for service. Similarly, a small number   of individuals who were identified as alcohol dependent were also found responsible for a disproportionate number of calls for police assistance. Napa Police Department has also prepared a lengthy list of ""camps"" established by the homeless within the city limits. The list includes nearly all of the bridges in town, other areas along the Napa River, and abandoned houses and buildings. The report noted that an increasing number of the homeless are now living in cars, trailers and motor homes. NPD estimates that, at minimum, there are 37 of these vehicles being used for shelter by the homeless at this time. In addition, there is a local ministry which provides vehicles, including motorhomes, to people being released from prison in the belief that recidivism rates will be reduced if a former inmate obtains shelter. The vehicles are provided as transportation as well as sleeping quarters. Many of these vehicles park on private property requiring police involvement to get them removed. In particular, those businesses with large parking lots are requesting police interference to have the vehicles removed. The Department appears to work well with the Homeless Outreach Coordinator employed by Progress Foundation. The Coordinator meets with or communicates with police on a near daily basis to coordinate the efforts of law enforcement and the various agencies devoted to assistance for the homeless. The officers of the Napa Police Department deserve admiration and appreciation for their efforts in helping the homeless community of Napa. According to the Continuum of Care report, as well as the 2001 Napa City Housing Element, there is a total of 260 to 273 beds for the homeless in Napa. Altogether it is estimated that upwards of five hundred persons are without shelter and sleep outdoors or in vehicles. PROCEDURES The committee on Special Needs Housing met with the following individuals: A former Director of Napa County Health and Human Services The present Director of Napa County Health and Human Services The Executive Director of Community Action of Napa Valley The Executive Director of Napa Housing Authority The Clinical Director of Progress Foundation The Outreach Worker from Progress Foundation Representatives of Catholic Charities An Outreach Minister from the Seventh Day Adventist Church Representatives of Family Services of the North Bay Napa's Police Chief A sergeant from the Napa Police Department   Representatives of Napa Shelter Project A representative of HomeBase Members of the committee on Special Needs Housing visited the following establishments: The Sullivan Shelter The Samaritan Shelter The Winter Shelter Hope Center Hospice of Napa Valley Continuum of Care committee meeting The committee reviewed the following documents: The ""Continuum of Care"" report The ""Napa City Housing Element"" report Napa Police Department report FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Finding 1 The current economy is placing ever more individuals and families at risk of losing their shelter. Without some intervention, the rolls of the homeless may significantly increase. Recommendation 1 Redouble efforts to prevent families and individuals from losing housing. Sustain and increase funding for the Rental Assistance Program and continue landlord-tenant mediation. Publish more widely the hotline phone number for those in immediate danger of losing shelter. Response Requested From Napa Napa Napa Napa County Health and Human Services City Council County Board of Supervisors Housing Authority Finding 2 The City of Napa has established an objective to provide permanent emergency shelters for 35 single men, 20 single women and 20 families.   Recommendation 2 The current numbers of homeless individuals and families exceed the City of Napa's five-year goal for permanent emergency shelters and a review of this projection should be undertaken. Response Requested From Napa County Health and Human Services Napa City Council Finding 3 The Sullivan Shelter is slated for imminent closure and needs to be replaced immediately. Recommendation 3: A replacement facility for the Sullivan Shelter needs to be located. The new shelter should provide space for at least twice the number currently able to be housed at the Sullivan building. The appropriate city/county agencies should set aside sufficient funds to qualify for state/federal matching funds. Response Requested From Napa County Health and Human Services Napa City Council Napa County Board of Supervisors Finding 4 The winter homeless shelter located on the grounds of the former California Department of Forestry (CDF) facility on Jefferson Street is no longer available because a senior housing project is slated to be built on that site. Recommendation 4 A new site needs to be located for the winter shelter prior to the onset of inclement weather in 2002. The appropriate city/county agencies should set aside sufficient funds to qualify for state/federal matching funds. Response Requested From Napa County Health and Human Services Napa City Council Napa County Board of Supervisors   Finding 5 A significant amount of General Assistance money (over $400,000) is spent on temporary lodging for homeless individuals and families each year. Recommendation 5 The money expended for temporary lodging of homeless individuals and families might be better spent on the expansion of existing facilities and the lease/purchase of more permanent facilities. Napa County should explore the possibility of site control either through long term leases or real estate acquisition. Response Requested From Napa County Health and Human Services Napa City Council Napa County Board of Supervisors Finding 6 A number of homeless individuals prefer their street existence and refuse to participate in shelter and treatment programs. Some of these individuals are involved in criminal behavior directed against our community. Recommendation 6 Many homeless individuals refusing shelter or treatment still require assistance in obtaining basic food and clothing needs. However, if their lifestyle choice includes criminal activities, our community should be protected from these individuals. County services should be designed to help support their basic needs while also providing for the safety and rights of the rest of our community. Response Requested From Napa County Health and Human Services Napa Police Department Finding 7 The committee noted that there is available grant monies on both the state and federal level which is not being obtained by Napa County agencies, both public and non-profit. Substantial sums may be acquired by the county to address the needs of the homeless population which could substantially   ameliorate the problem. It appears that there is a lack of persons with the knowledge and aptitude required to apply for these specific grants. Recommendation 7 Health and Human Services should ensure that at least one employee has sufficient training and experience in grant-writing to be able to assist the various members of the Continuum of Care in order to facilitate the receipt of additional grant monies to fund the necessary projects. Response Requested From Napa County Health and Human Services Napa City Council Napa County Board of Supervisors Finding 8 There is an ongoing problem with the homeless which requires several man-hours of city police involvement each month. Private property owners are requiring police assistance in evicting mobilehomes from their parking lots. Recommendation 8 County and City agencies should undertake an investigation into the possibility of setting aside some public land where the homeless could legally park their vehicles overnight, together with the provision of rudimentary services such as bathroom facilities.

Every year the Grand Jury receives several completed forms and also complaint letters that describe problems and may request investigations of various government entities. These letters are a valuable source of information for a grand jury, particularly as it begins its term and is deciding on its investigative agenda. PROCEDURES In the case of the 2001-2002 Grand Jury, such letters and citizen complaints were considered initially by the full Grand Jury and then, if the Jury decided it was warranted, either routed to the Grand Jury committees that were investigating related subject areas or a new committee was formed to review the matter. Some complaints were integrated into the investigative work of the various Grand Jury committees. The investigating body reported back with a recommendation for disposition, which was then decided upon by the full Jury. The complaint topics were often addressed, either directly or indirectly, in individual agency findings and recommendations incorporated in the Grand Jury Final Report. Some complaints and the issues they raised were judged to not fall under the jurisdiction of the Grand Jury. All citizen complaints receive a response from the Grand Jury as to what disposition was decided upon by the whole Grand Jury.   CITIZEN COMPLAINT FORM Note: all matters brought before the Grand Jury are required by law to be kept confidential.

GX052-57-10005837	"Montgomery County Council   News Release May 17, 2000     Schools, Transportation, Preserving ""Open Space"" Big Winners... County Council Approves $2.62 Billion Operating Budget $1.7 Billion Capital Budget Targets School Construction, Roads,  Strathmore Concert Hall, New Rockville Library    Schools, transportation, public safety, and preserving open spaces carried the day today as the Montgomery County Council approved a $2.62 billion operating budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 and a $1.7 billion six-year capital improvements program.   The operating budget adds nearly $12 million in funding for County schools requested by the Board of Education, including funds for algebra and other math programs, reading initiatives, staff development, expanding All-Day Kindergarten, and reducing over-sized high school classes. In all, more than half the Countys operating budget goes to public education, including Montgomery College.   In the capital program, the Council funded construction for 11 elementary school gymnasiums. The Council set aside $25 million in capital funds for anticipated school construction projects not yet in the six-year capital program.    ""These budgets get things done for Montgomery County,"" said Council President Michael Subin. ""We are putting our money where our mouth is by giving our schools, our parents, and our teachers the tools they need to keep our education system world-class.    ""Weve taken just about the same money as the County Exec proposed and redeployed it.   ""This Council put back into the budget $11.9 million for math, reading, All-day Kindergarten, and other initiatives.    ""We are building a new Rockville library three years sooner.    ""By spending our capital resources more strategically, we are preventing three clusters from going into moratorium for more housing.    ""We are increasing our affordable housing program by 61 percent for 2001.    ""This Council is building 11 new elementary gyms.    ""Weve more than doubled proposed spending to preserve our open spaces for future generations. We are reaching out to preserve and improve the quality of life we all deserve.   ""We are investing in roads and transit so folks like you and me can get where we are going more quickly  and have more time to spend with our families.   ""We are investing in bricks and mortar but  more importantly  we are investing in our residents, and especially in our children. They are Montgomerys most valuable resource.   ""And we are doing this all in a fiscally prudent way. We are setting $25 million aside for needed school construction not yet in our plan.    ""We are saving $2 million by funding a new Rockville library outright, rather than relying on forward funding by the city.""   The County Council also boosted spending on transportation initiatives in the capital and operating budgets, including nearly $6 million in capital monies for planning and design and land acquisition for the Montrose Parkway. The Council voted to decrease the cost of ""Ride-On"" bus passes by 44 percent to encourage transit use and help ease traffic congestion.    The Council gave approval to $33 million for the ""Legacy Open Space"" program, an ambitious new proposal to preserve for the future green spaces and other sites of environmental, agricultural, or historical significance. The public monies would supplement a projected $9 million in private resources. The County Executive had recommended $15 million in public monies for the project.    Other highlights include acceleration by three years of planning and design on a new Germantown library, four new recreation centers in the county, an $89 million concert hall at Strathmore, and a new indoor swim center in Germantown.   The County Executives revised recommended operating budget totaled $2.62 billion  an 8.6 percent increase over last year. The Council figure is only $4.9 million more than that -- an 8.8 percent increase over last year.   The approved Council budget also includes a projection of zero rate increases for Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission ratepayers for the next five years, reflects a prohibition on any fees charged for semiannual payment of property taxes, and also includes the approval of two premium holidays for County employees health insurance, which saves County taxpayers $3.2 million.    Schools   Schools got top billing from the Council in both the capital program and the operating budget. In the operating budget, the Council funded the Board of Educations requests including:      Hiring and training more teachers. Over 1,400 new teachers will be hired. In addition to making possible many new instructional initiatives, these teachers will support previous Council initiatives to reduce class size for reading classes in the early grades to a maximum of 15 students and in ninth grade algebra classes to 20 students and to make major reductions in grades one and two in high-need schools.   Spending doubled for teacher development, designed to strengthen reading, math, and a host of other system initiatives. Each of 186 schools will have a Staff Development Teacher to work with teachers on professional enrichment. The system will hire 36 permanent substitutes to spell regular teachers as they increase their skills.    $1.2 million for strengthening mathematics in elementary, middle, and high schools, with increased funding for algebra programs, and summer programs to bolster lagging students in algebra.    $2.6 million to raise literacy standards in the County schools, that may include providing all elementary schools with a full-time reading teacher, support innovative projects by community groups to improve literacy, focus on reading for children needing help in grades 1-3, intervention with students failing reading in grades 3 and 6, and increased training for third-grade teachers involving in the systems ""Reading Initiative.""    In the capital budget, education also won significant support:      Construction of 11 elementary school gymnasiums.   $25 million set aside by the Council in the capital program for additional school construction needs to increase capacity that are projected to come into the capital budget over the next two years.   Feasibility planning funds for a new middle school in the Quince Orchard cluster to relieve overcrowding at Kingsview Middle School.   $20 million to alleviate overcrowded school conditions in the Up County in the Damascus and Watkins Mill clusters.   Planning funds for additions at three schools, new or expanded additions at six schools, and additions at 11 schools slated for modernization.   $4 million to build an on-site replacement school for Richard Montgomery High School.   By reopening Northwood High School to relieve overcrowding in the Blair cluster, the Council will spend about $5 million rather than a projected $54 million to further enlarge Blair and Einstein high schools.   $70 million for the expansion of Montgomery Colleges Takoma Park campus and nearly $24 million for renovation of the Science East and West buildings and the Student Center on the Rockville campus.   $870,000 in funding restored by the Council for technology projects for instructional programs at Montgomery College and another $437,500 restored for technology-related projects at the Takoma Park campus.    Transportation   The County Council also boosted spending on a balanced program of road and transit improvements to improve safety, help alleviate traffic congestion, and increase transportation options for County residents.   The capital budget includes:      Nearly $6 million in capital monies for planning and design and land acquisition for the Montrose Parkway. This is in keeping with the County Executives timetable.   $9 million to widen Travilah Road between Darnestown Road and Dufief Road in North Potomac and add a hiker-biker trail along the north side of the road.   $8.2 million to construct Woodfield Road Extended in Damascus.    Replacement of three deteriorating bridges: on Goshen Road near Montgomery Village, on Clarksburg Road near Damascus, and on Mouth of Monocacy Road near Dickerson.    Design and construction of the Forest Glen pedestrian bridges over three Capital Beltway interchange ramps and a hike/biker trail along Georgia Avenue through its intersection with the Capital Beltway to allow Montgomery Hills residents access to the Forest Glen Metro.    Acceleration by one year for both planning on Father Hurley Boulevard and planning for widening Goshen Road.   Intersection improvements to improve traffic and safety flow for Old Georgetown Road ($2.6 million) and Jones Bridge Road at Rockville Pike ($1.1 million).   Construction of new parking garages at the Shady Grove and Grosvenor Metro stations ($49.2 million), development of the Silver Spring Transit Center ($39.9 million), and construction of the new Takoma-Langley Crossroads Transit Terminal ($1.1 million)  all to increase mass transit options for commuters.    These new projects are in addition to already approved Council projects such as the new road construction on Norbeck Road Extended and Germantown Road Extended, road widenings such as Shady Grove Road and Briggs Chaney Road, and several intersection improvements.    In the operating budget, the Council also moved to expand transportation options for County residents and help ease traffic congestion with a bold and innovative program:   *The Council approved a 44 percent decrease in fares for the Countys ""Ride- On"" bus service, which carries 60 percent of County bus riders. The costs for both a two-week Ride-On pass and a 20-ride Ride-On pass would fall from $18 at present to $10, at an estimated cost , with related expenditures, of $1.3 million. The Council will work with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority for similar reductions for Metrobuses operating in Montgomery County.   When the Council last year decreased the price of the ""Cruiser Pass,"" a monthly pass available to riders under 18 years old from $20 to $10, sales of the passes increased by 118 percent. This actually  increased  total revenue collected by the County from the passes  even with cutting the fare in half.   ""This initiative to reduce transit fares not only can increase transit usage, but can also help reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and give back money to low and moderate-income persons who depend on bus service,"" said Councilmember Isiah Leggett, who chairs the Councils Transportation and Environment Committee.    The Ride-On fare cut for passes is projected to go into effect in September.      The Council added an Express Bus Route from Frederick City to Rock Spring Park (using I-270 HOV lanes), then north to Executive Boulevard via Old Georgetown Road in the morning, with an evening return in the opposite direction at a cost to the County of $100,000.   The Council approved a measure to connect the Garrett Park MARC station to Rock Spring Park by diverting the #6 Ride On from Wheaton and adding another bus to the route to insure that each MARC train is met by a bus at a cost of $50,000.   An enhanced ""Super Fare Share"" program for Bethesda and North Bethesda for $175,000 and $100,000, respectively, will provide County matching monies for businesses who subsidize their employees transit ridership.   A ""Super Fare Share"" program would be established to encourage transit ridership in businesses in the Friendship Heights area for $50,000.    $300,000 for tree pruning, $80,000 to update the Countys bike route map and signage for bike routes, $50,000 for safety-related reflectorized pavement markings, and $100,000 additional for residential road resurfacing        Public Safety   In the capital budget, the Council approved:      Two new fire stations for the growing Germantown area   $500,000 to help with renovations to the Rockville Volunteer Fire Departments Fire Station 3.   $55.6 million for final design and installation of a new Public Safety Radio System for public safety personnel and citizens. The Council recently approved another $5.8 million for a new Emergency Communications Center as a part of the Public Safety 2000 project.    And in the operating budget:      $220,000 for mounted police patrols in the Silver Spring business district   38 new police officers, 72 additional correctional officers, 9 new Sheriffs deputies, and 28 new fire and rescue workers. Four of the new police officers will be dedicated to the Silver Spring business district. Two will strengthen the investigation of sex crimes against children.   $150,000 to establish a System-wide Team for Emergency Victim Safety under the Sheriffs Office to anticipate and respond to critical domestic violence situations. In addition, three of the new Sheriffs deputies will strengthen the ability to check on the welfare of victims of domestic violence and to serve protective and other orders.    $250,000 to fund the Betty Ann Krahnke Center against Domestic Violence, a facility for abused women and children.   $4.1 million during fiscal years 2000 and 2001 for a Juvenile Assessment Center to insure greater efficiency and effectiveness in the juvenile justice system.   $54,730 for an Assistant States Attorney to enhance prosecution of economic and fraud crimes.         Recreation   In the capital budget:      Four new community recreational centers, in Mid-County, North Bethesda, White Oak/Kemp Mill, and North Potomac.   $33 million for the ""Legacy Open Space"" project to preserve open spaces in the County from development, to be supplemented by a projected $9 million in private monies. The County Executive had proposed spending $15 million.   $89 million for a 2,000 seat performing arts and education center at Strathmore. The Council approved a $44.5 million cap on County funding for the project, which is shared 50-50 with the state.   $52 million for park development, including a major start on fulfilling the Countywide Trails Plan in 10 years or less, more ballfields, and significant funding for renovation and maintenance to protect our crown jewel parks system.    In the operating budget:      $1.3 million to rehabilitate the Georgetown Branch Trestle over Rock Creek to accommodate hikers and bikers using the Capital Crescent Trail   $135,000 for the maintenance of County-owned trails, with $60,000 targeted to Georgetown Branch Trail maintenance and a requirement that the County establish a permanent, ongoing program for trail maintenance    Housing    In the operating and capital budgets:      A significant increase in County funding toward preserving affordable housing and revitalizing older communities in the County by approving $6,770,000 in the fiscal year 2001 operating budget and $500,000 in the capital improvements program for the Countys Montgomery Housing Initiative for a total of $7.2 million -- an increase from the $2.7 million in the County Executives proposed January CIP budget.    The Housing Initiative Fund serves as a resource for community groups, renters, and property owners to help preserve housing at affordable prices for poor and working families and to assist in repairs and renovations to improve properties and their surrounding neighborhoods. The Fund makes rehabilitation loans and helps finance non-profit acquisition of multifamily housing.   A new initiative  ""Building Neighborhoods to Call Home ""  involves assistance to tenants, a resource center for landlords of affordable housing, promotion of more affordable housing near job centers, and strategic investments to preserve and improve neighborhoods. Under this initiative, $1.2 million would go for nonprofit acquisitions and rehabilitation, $200,000 for landlord outreach and tenant education, and $100,000 for neighborhood planning and outreach.      By investing more capital dollars in transportation, three clusters  Damascus, Watkins Mill, and Einstein  will stay out of housing moratoriums required by the Countys annual growth policy, which would prevent approvals of more housing in those areas.    Health & Human Services   In the operating budget, Council actions included:      $800,000 increase (to $1.3 million) for Linkages to Learning program for 8 schools and the International Center.   $250,000 more (for a total of $500,000) to provide a potential 2 percent increase to County HHS contractors  the County Executive had proposed only a 1 percent increase.   $669,000 to address mental health needs involving the criminal justice and corrections systems.   $526,000 as a ""safety net"" to assure mental health services for County children.   Extending ""Rewarding Work"" programs for the working poor, including child care, housing, job skills, and health care assistance.   $170,000 for home health care to serve 22 additional clients, cutting the waiting list in half.   $100,000 for adult foster care, serving 15 additional clients and cutting the waiting list to 25.   $300,000 for the African American Health Initiative and $100,000 (double the County Executives recommendation) for the Latino Health Initiative.    An additional two nursing home inspectors for the County.   $5.53 million for programs for adults with developmental disabilities.    $100,000 to assist the Primary Care Coalition, a group of health providers, in improving their delivery of care to the uninsured.   $42,500 to provide transportation for seniors to and from three recreation centers  East County, Germantown, and Longview.    Assistance to the Hebrew Home ($200,000) and the Jewish Foundation for Group Homes ($100,000) for nursing home renovations, $40,000 for ramps at adult foster care homes, $250,000 to purchase a building for Jubilee Association, serving the developmentally disabled.   $60,000 to Shepherds Table, serving the homeless in Silver Spring, for meal programs and an eye clinic.   $66,000 to Teen Tobacco, an anti-tobacco initiative run by students -- talking to students -- in the Montgomery public schools.   $50,000 more for Mobile Medical to extend their medical care for the homeless to other low-income residents.   $80,000 for the Volunteer Dental Clinic (a 50 percent increase over the recommended budget).   $73,500 for computer training for seniors.    Libraries   Under the capital program:      $21 million for full County funding of a new Rockville library  three years ahead of schedule. County funding saves about $2 million in interest costs that would have been incurred under the plan for Rockville city to forward fund the project.   Acceleration of planning and design by three years on a new Germantown library.    On the operating budget side:      $50,000 more for the Department of Public Libraries to add Sunday telephone reference service.        Other operating budget items include:      $50,000 to explore possibilities for ""Heritage Tourism"" to highlight Montgomery Countys historical sites.   $44,000 in total funding to the Korean American Education Foundation, the Korean American Association of Maryland, and the Korean American Senior Citizens Association.    Fees & Charges      Increase of $1 million in the Countys ""Working Families Income Supplement,"" which provides funds to match the state earned income tax credit for the working poor.   Approval of the operating budget for the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) for the coming year, with projections of zero water and sewer rate increases over the next five years.    This five-year freeze on rates follows the last two years of no increases and is the fruit of an effort by the Montgomery and Prince Georges County Councils starting in 1994 to control WSSC spending and promote more efficiencies. Prior to that plan, WSSC rates had increased for 19 consecutive years.   In addition to the rate freeze, the budget projects a 21 percent decrease in the WSSC work force over the next five years--resulting from WSSCs ambitious ""Competitive Action Program."" The budget also assumes a 14 percent increase this year in using current revenue to reduce WSSC debt.      The Council prohibited the County from charging a fee to homeowners who pay their property taxes semiannually.     Beginning in July 2000, homeowners will pay property taxes semiannually, unless they choose not to. The State of Maryland gives counties the option to charge a fee for semiannual payment. Under legislation recently passed, the Council prohibited any such fee for Montgomery County residents, which could have amounted to $21 on an annual tax bill of $2600.      The Council, taking note that the reserves in the Countys health insurance fund are well above target, approved two holidays for health insurance premiums that will save County taxpayers $3.2 million in fiscal year 2001 and individual County employees up to $126. Retired employees will also see one monthly premium savings.         Patrick Lacefield, (240) 777-7939  Jean Arthur, (240) 777-7934    county.council@montgomerycountymd.gov"
