We've made  a list  of some places on our website and other     websites to check.        Q. I need to do a report on an oil spill other than the Exxon Valdez (my     teacher says it's too popular!). Can you please tell me where I can get information about other important oil     spills?        A. In the  Historical Incidents     database  on our Incident News website, you'll find information about many significant oil spills worldwide. Our     photo gallery also features  photos of major oil spills , along with a     little information about each of those spills. You also can read or download  reports describing oil and chemical spills  that we have responded to during the last 6 years, or view our  Oil Spill Case Histories  document ( PDF  file; 2.2 MB).        Elsewhere on the Web, you can see the  U.S. Coast Guard annual data and graphics on spills in the U.S. , Environment Canada's  Summaries of Spill Events in Canada  and its  Worldwide Tanker Spills database , a  list of major oil spills in Australia  from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, and the University of Wales Swansea website about the  1996 Sea Empress oil spill in Wales . You also can find information about  major oil spills in France  on the CEDRE website, including the Erika and Amoco Cadiz spills in Brittany, as well as brief descriptions of significant oil spills worldwide since 1967. The  International Tanker Owners Federation (ITOPF)  offers updates on current major spills, as well as links to online  oil spill case history information . For more information, we     suggest extending your information search to your local city or university library.        Q. Where in the world do most oil spills happen?        A. Oil spills happen all around the world. Analysts for the Oil Spill Intelligence Report (available at the  Aspen Publishers website ), who track oil spills of at least 10,000 gallons (34 tons), reported that spills in that size range have occurred in the waters of 112 nations since 1960. But they also reported (Etkin 1997) that oil spills happen more frequently in certain parts of the world. They identified the following ""hot spots"" for oil spills from vessels: the Gulf of Mexico (267 spills); the northeastern U.S. (140 spills); the Mediterranean Sea (127 spills); the Persian Gulf (108 spills); the North Sea (75 spills); Japan (60 spills); the Baltic Sea (52 spills); the United Kingdom and English Channel (49 spills); Malaysia and Singapore (39 spills); the west coast of France and north and west coasts of Spain (33 spills); and Korea (32 spills).     Also, U.S. Coast Guard analysts have prepared some  graphs and charts  that show the frequencies of oil     spills in different regions of the U.S. and its coastal zone.

Do most oil spills originate from tankers?        A. Information from several sources tells us that the answer to your question is: No, as long as     you consider spills of all sizes. But tanker accidents have accounted for most of the world's largest oil spills.     They are less frequent than other kinds of oil spills, such as pipeline breaks, but typically involve large volumes     of spilled oil relative to other kinds of oil spills.        Here are some sources of information on this topic:        Analysts for the Oil Spill Intelligence Report (available at the  Aspen Publishers website ) track oil spills of at least 10,000 gallons (34 tons). In their annual ""International Oil Spill Statistics"" report for 1999, they reported that in that year--the latest year for which they have analyzed data--about 32 million gallons of oil spilled into the water or onto land, in 257 incidents. Of those incidents, only 11 were spills from tankers, accounting for about 6.6 million gallons, or about one-fifth of the total volume of oil spilled. Twenty-five of the 257 spills were from barges and other kinds of vessels, such as freighters (totaling 1.5 million gallons). Eighteen spills were from trucks or railroad trains (totaling about half a million gallons). The largest number of spills, and the largest volume of oil spilled were from accidents involving pipelines or fixed facilities (131 pipeline spills, totaling about 18.8 million gallons; 66 spills from facilities, totaling about 4.7 million gallons). The percentages of oil spilled from different sources vary greatly from year to year; in some years, tanker accidents represent the largest single source of spilled oil, but only in a very few years is it the case that most of the oil spilled (in significant spills) during that year came from tankers. DeCola (2000) presents a graph showing the volume of oil spilled from various sources, including tankers, from 1978 to 1992.        However, tanker accidents have been the cause of most of the very largest oil spills. The Cutter     Information Corporation analysts also have found that of  the 66     spills  in which at least 10 million gallons (34,000 tonnes) of oil were lost, 48 were from tankers). Eight were     from fixed facilities, especially storage tanks, 5 were from production oil wells, three were from pipelines, and     two were from other kinds of cargo vessels.        Note that the above statistics are only for relatively large oil spills. Researchers from NASA     and the Smithsonian Institution have estimated the amounts of oil that spill from small and large sources. Their  oil pollution graph  shows that     much more oil is estimated to spill into the water from small sources than from major accidents. They also estimate     that  just 5% of the oil that spills     into the ocean  comes from major oil spills. Check the  State of Alaska's list of recent     spills  to see that most accidental oil spills are much smaller than the major incidents that you hear about on     the news.        You can see some more oil spill statistics at the the  International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation website .        Reference:  DeCola, E. 2000. International Oil Spill Statistics: 2000.     Arlington, MA: Cutter Information Corporation.        Q. What was the biggest oil spill in the world? Where and when did it     happen, and what were its consequences?        According to the  Oil Spill Intelligence Report , the biggest so far was the Arabian (Persian) Gulf spill in 1991. You can find very good overviews of the effects of that spill in the August 1991 and February 1992 issues of National Geographic magazine.        Q. When was the first oil spill in the United States?                A. Perhaps no one knows for sure just when the first U.S. spill happened. Here are some suggested       possibilities from our oil spill experts:                    Oil from natural seeps was in the water before the first spills from oil production. In the early 1500s, the Portuguese-born explorer  Juan Cabrillo  [National Park Service website] sailed into what is now Santa Barbara, California, and remarked on the oil he saw bubbling out from a natural seep. He reported that the Chumash Indians scooped and skimmed up the oil, which they used to waterproof their boats.            The first oil well in the U.S. was drilled in 1859 in an area of natural oil seeps along Oil Creek, near Titusville, Pennsylvania. It's possible--although we don't know for sure--that the first oil spills from oil production may have occurred when crude oil was first transported from this well.            The U.S. Fish Commission (NOAA's precursor) steamer  Albatross  reported a         massive oil slick extending from L.A. south to northern San Diego County around 1889 or 1890. We don't know the         source of this slick.            In the late 19-teens, hopane, a chemical ""signal"" of spilled oil, began appearing in the sediments of Puget         Sound, Washington State, indicating that oil had been spilled into the Sound. Hopane's appearance peaked during         WWII and has since been slowly declining.            After passage of federal legislation in 1925, the California Fish and Game Department began a major effort         to reduce spills and leakages from coastal oil drilling operations in California, which then were common. In         1929, for example, a 600-barrel spill covered 9 miles of Ventura County Beach. By 1930, spills from ships were         considered a greater menace than shoreline leakage.                  Our thanks to Gary J. Green for help with this question. If you discover more clues to help answer it, please let our webmaster (  ) know!              Q. I'd like some information about an oil (or chemical) spill that happened     recently in my state (within the U.S.). Where can I go for that information?        A. Check with the Regional Response Team (RRT) for your region. Within each region of the U.S.,     the RRT is responsible for planning and coordinating regional preparedness and responses to oil and hazardous     materials releases. To find the RRT for your region, visit the  NRT website ,     scroll down the page to the ""RRTs"" button, then click that button. You'll find a link to your RRT's website.        Also, your state's environmental agency also may track spills in your state. To find a point of     contact, visit your state's web site (the Library of Congress keeps  a list of all state government websites ), and look for the link     to your state's environmental agency (if you know its name), or for a keyword like ""environment"" (example     environmental agency names are the Washington Department of Ecology and the Oregon Department of Environmental     Quality).        Finally, a source of information about many spills that happened at least a year or so ago is our      Historical Incidents database .

Controlling NOx emissions from large stationary sources, including industry and electric utilities, and mobile sources, is the most effective way of reducing these harmful emissions since NOx is produced primarily from the burning of fuel. Maryland's attainment goal was set at 22 percent reduction by May 2003. As a result, EPA's plan is expected to reduce NOx emissions by 21,000 tons during Maryland's summer ozone season. In the northeast states, the reductions required by EPA's plan are roughly similar, but in some cases slightly more restrictive, than those required under the Ozone Transport Commission regional plan. States must submit their reduction plans to the EPA by September 1999. The submittal must include enforceable regulations to achieve the required reductions in NOx emissions and a plan to allocate NOx emissions to Maryland sources. The Maryland Department of the Environment is working with affected sources and other interested parties to determine how the reductions will be made. Historically, efforts to control the formation of ground-level ozone, Maryland's most pressing air pollutant, were focussed on reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the precursors of ozone. While these VOC emission reductions produced some lowering of ambient ozone levels, it became clear that additional measures were (continued on page 2)  Public Meetings to be Held to Discuss Maryland's Environmental Goals Tentative Meeting Schedule January 25, 1999 Charles County Community College  Center for Business & Industry  Rm.

Regional NOx Plan.... needed, leading to an increased focus on the other ozone precursor--nitrogen oxides. Based on the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, reductions of NOx emissions for facilities emitting NOx in Maryland have progressed in three phases The federal Clean Air Act requires that all major NOx sources install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). The first requirement is a sourcespecific requirement to achieve ""reasonable"" reductions. All affected sources in Maryland have submitted and implemented their NOx RACT requirements. RACT achieved a 28,000 ton reduction of NOx during the summer ozone season in Maryland. The Clean Air Act also created the Ozone Transport Commission. This group of states from Northern Virginia to Maine, known as the Ozone Transport Region, has been working together to reduce ground-level ozone in the Northeast. After several years of studying the transport of ozone and its precursors, the Ozone Transport Commission determined that NOx emissions and ozone not only are transported on air currents, but also have a significant effect on ozone in downwind areas when transported. In 1994, the Ozone Transport Commission finalized a Memorandum of Understanding that instituted a regional NOx reduction plan for the region, requiring significant NOx reductions beyond RACT levels from large boilers which are predominantly utilities. The Ozone Transport Commission regional NOx reduction plan contemplated two levels of NOx reductions. The first level is a requirement to achieve a 55 percent or 65 percent reduction in NOx emissions by 1999 depending on a source's location within the region. Ozone Transport Commission states have since acted to implement these reductions by adopting individual state regulations to accomplish the reductions. Maryland's NOx reduction regulation became effective on June 1, 1998 and requires utilities and other major sources to reduce NOx emissions by as much as 65 percent by May 1999. When implemented, Maryland's regulation is expected to achieve a 35,000 ton reduction in NOx emissions during the summer ozone season. Sources can accomplish these reductions by installing controls or purchasing allowances from other sources. The utilities have sued MDE over the regulation, challenging the May 1999 compliance deadline and stating that allowances will not be available to those seeking to purchase them. The second level of NOx reductions under the Ozone Transport Commission's regional NOx reduction plan would come into play if further study and modeling shows a need and would require a 75 percent reduction by 2003. Finally, the EPA and the Environmental Council of the States convened the Ozone Transport Assessment Group to carry out the needed additional study and modeling. Composed of EPA officials, 37 states from the Rocky Mountains eastward, industry and trade association representatives, and health and environmental groups, the Ozone Transport Assessment Group confirmed the importance of ozone transport outside of the Northeast. Modeling from the group also indicated that additional NOx reductions would be needed for ozone attainment. In July 1997, the group issued final recommendations to EPA about controls for both volatile organic compounds and NOx to address long-range transport of ozone and ozone precursors. The recommendations covered a range of sources including utilities, other large and small stationary sources, motor vehicles, diesel engines, fuels and consumer products. This work served as a basis for the new EPA regional NOx reduction plan announced earlier.  Businesses For the Bay the use of solvents as a metal degreaser. Northrop Grumman uses paints with low levels of volatile organic compounds and equipment that allows them to apply less paint to their products without reducing quality. At Northrop Grumman, employees are trained and encouraged to seek out pollution prevention (P2) opportunities. As Steve McKew, manager of Compliance Engineering at Northrop Grumman explains, ""The success of our pollution prevention programs has focused on multi-disciplinary teams that have integrated P2 from our maintenance operations to the design of high-tech electronics. P2 has not only been good for the environment, but also has supported our business plan."" Northrop Grumman has been a member of Businesses for the Bay, a voluntary pollution prevention program, since 1996 and has also volunteered as a Businesses for the Bay mentor to help businesses prevent pollution.

Environmental Indicators Report  by Edwal Stone and Jeffrey Rein The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) recently received the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) approval of a comprehensive plan to improve the processing of wastewater discharge permit renewals to strengthen accountability for the impact of all wastewater discharge pollution sources on a receiving stream or river. The plan requires that all wastewater discharge permit renewals within a watershed be considered during the same administrative cycle versus the traditional first-come, first-serve basis. For watershed-based permitting purposes, Maryland has been divided into five geographic areas. To get each permit on cycle for its watershed, any permit with less than half of the effective period remaining when its watershed is being permitted will be processed early for reissuance with all of the other permits in the watershed. Other permits may be allowed to expire and then administratively extended (for no more than two and a half years) to come into cycle  with the other permits in the watershed group. All permittees in the Lower Eastern Shore/Coastal Bays watershed, the first scheduled watershed, are being sent letters this month announcing the new permit renewal schedule. Permittees in the other four major watershed groups will be contacted later this year. MDE expects to have fully implemented these cycles by the end of 1999. Not every application for a permit can be scheduled with its associated watershed. MDE will continue to give priority to new permits and to permit modification requests to meet the startup needs of businesses or to address  significant environmental concerns. The new watershed-based permitting system system uses existing monitoring and sampling data being collected for determination of the Total Maximum Daily Loads required to protect water quality in Maryland's rivers and estuaries. Watershed permitting also will help position Maryland's point source regulatory control program to assist other State agencies in implementing the restoration strategies of the Clinton Administration's Clean Water Action Plan and Maryland's Smart Growth policies.

America Recycles Day a Success Florida Resident Wins American Green Dream House by Virginia Lipscomb And Bonnie Berardelli America Recycles Day, held November 15, was celebrated in Maryland through 41 separate successful public outreach activities. Nationwide, 2.15 million individuals from 38 states and two American territories pledged to improve their personal recycling efforts. The Eastern Shore, and Montgomery and Anne Arundel counties held several household hazardous waste collections. Many counties produced proclamations from their county leaders to encourage citizens to pledge to do more for recycling. Others staffed community events where over 12,000 Marylanders completed the personal pledge card and entered to win the American Green Dream House offered by the America Recycles Day national organizers. The Maryland Recyclers Coalition organized and managed the Maryland Recycling Trail where public and privately owned material recovery facilities, the first stop for most curbside and drop-off recyclables, and recycling centers opened their doors for public tours. The ""trail"" then continued through ten of the more than two hundred businesses and industries that either recycle materials or utilize recycled materials in their products. The American Green Dream House drawing winner was Lori McKee of Boca Raton, Florida, who pledged to buy more products with recycled content. The winner of the Walt Disney World trip for four was Cecil Roberts, a fourth grade student from Tyner, Kentucky.  Santa and some of Charles County's youngest recyclers joined ""Blue Bin Bobbie"" to help promote America Recycles Day during a parade in Charles County.  page 3   MDEnvironment Protecting Water Resources: Part one in a series to help you understand water regulations and programs by Jim George A large number of government and private organizations are working to preserve Maryland's water quality for future generations. With so many environmental partners, the network of ongoing statutory programs, voluntary agreements and interim initiatives is sometimes difficult to sort out. The federal government sets the basic framework for protecting our environment. Federal laws, like the Clean Water Act (CWA), establish a baseline of nationwide protection which establishes a uniform climate for environmental regulation between the individual states. In addition to the major federal laws, state and local governments may adopt laws that provide additional protection. Many of the federal environmental laws are carried out by Maryland State government, using federal and state funds, under delegated federal authority. Maryland's county and city governments have environmental protection functions in departments with titles such as ""public works,"" ""parks,"" or ""licensing."" Similar arrangements of authority delegation exist between Maryland and many local governments. Within this framework, two major federal initiatives shape Maryland's water quality programs. The Clean Water Act, originally adopted in 1972 and administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is the main federal law that addresses environmental aspects of water quality while the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, first signed in 1983 by Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, District of Columbia and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is a voluntary regional compact. Although the roles of the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) have changed over the years, DNR currently oversees Maryland's involvement in the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, and MDE acts as the primary administrator of the Clean Water Act. Because the Bay Agreement is voluntary, and most provisions of the Clean Water Act are regulatory, these roles are consistent with MDE's responsibility as the state's environmental regulatory agency. Overiew of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement The Chesapeake Bay Agreement has been amended several times since 1983, and is supplemented by numerous action-oriented regional directives. The most prominent initiative, the 40 Percent Nutrient Reduction Goal is being guided through each state's Tributary Strategy. This nutrient goal is linked to the more recent Riparian Forest Buffer Goal, which targets the establishment of 2010 miles of stream buffers by 2010 to help reduce nutrients and improve stream habitat. The Toxics Reduction and Prevention Strategy builds on the 1987 Bay Agreement Amendments. This framework commits the states to a regional focus, conducting assessments, regulatory implementation, and to pollution prevention. The Framework for Habitat Restoration initiative establishes fish passage goals to open 1,357 miles of spawning streams currently blocked by dams, Submerged Aquatic Vegetation goals for reestablishing underwater plants that promote the settling of sediments to improve water clarity and provide hiding places and other habitat, and a commitment to set goals for the reestablishment of oyster reefs. The important role of wetlands were noted in the 1987 Amendments, and a commitment to ""no net loss"" was made in 1989. A wetlands initiative was then crafted to provide guidance to state and local governments. The 1997 Wetlands Protection and Restoration Goals was adopted to establish a  Explore More on Your Own!

Maryland has independently adopted a Wetland Recovery Goal of 60,000 acres. Overview of the Clean Water Act The Clean Water Act is a 1977 amendment to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, which set the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States. The law gave the EPA the authority to set standards for the quality of discharge effluents, which required the uniform adoption of certain control technologies for industry. Recognizing that those technologies might be insufficient to protect the water quality in every case, the law gave the EPA the authority to set water quality standards and to tailor or deny discharge permits to ensure that receiving water quality is protected. Many roles, such as setting  standards, permitting, administration, and enforcement are delegated to state governments with EPA oversight. Various amendments to the law coincided with the evolution of managing and funding the control of pollution from point source discharges. However, recognizing that many pollutants are washed from the surface of land into the water, the 1987 amendment introduced provisions in the Clean Water Act guiding states to develop nonpoint source management plans, and makes available grants to implement those plans. Although the Clean Water Act does not give EPA authority to enforce nonpoint source plans, they may withhold grant funding for states that fail to develop and maintain these plans. New Initiatives and Beyond In recent years, the U.S. EPA has embraced a holistic approach to water quality management, applied to various sized watersheds. It is within this context that states are to develop total maximum daily loads (TMDLs), which specify the upper threshold for substances or stressors that a water body can receive and still meet water quality standards. Most recently, the EPA and USDA have initiated a Clean Water Action Plan to fulfill the original goal of the Clean Water Act and achieve ""fishable and swimmable"" water for every American. In addition to these initiatives, the Chesapeake Bay Program is undertaking the Chesapeake 2000 initiative to prepare future amendments to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement.

Low-Impact Development (LID) can be used by land developers as a less expensive alternative to current practices required under stringent Storm water management regulations imposed by the State and the County. By combining hydro logically functional site design (micro-management techniques) with pollution prevention measures, low-impact development can compensate for development impacts on hydrology and water quality. Its goal is to mimic runoff conditions that existed prior to development by managing runoff in small, cost effective, landscaped features located on building lots instead of being conveyed to a large treatment pond. Additionally, Best Management Practices (BMPs) are integrated into the site design at every juncture. Since LID designs reduce the need for clearing and grading, require less impervious surface, and eliminate pipes, inlet structures and storm water ponds, site development costs can be reduced by as much as 25-30 percent, with corresponding cost savings in long-term infrastructure maintenance costs. The Low-Impact Development approach also has been recognized by the Maryland Department of the Environment as an equivalent alternative to their proposed new design requirements. EPA has given the County a grant to develop a national LID guidance manual, which will be available early next year. EPA is currently investigating the County's LID program as an option for addressing the storm water portion of combined sewer overflows, prevalent in more highly developed, older urban areas.

Lower Eastern Shore Tributary Team Reaches Out to the Public by Christy Mills, DNR ""Good decisions,"" said Ed Ellis, chair of the Worcester County Planning Commission. ""Decisions that promote a balance [economic growth and environmental protection], increasingly require decision makers who are aware of--who understand-- and who continuously educate themselves on increasingly complex issues."" The Lower Eastern Shore Tributary Strategy Team continues to further the publics environmental education so that important environmental decisions came be made by working around the clock to organize two public workshops this past fall to educate the public about what individuals can do to reduce nutrient pollution reaching the Chesapeake Bay. The November symposium entitled How Human-Based Activities Affect the Chesapeake Bay focused on the effect of human-based activities on the waters of the Chesapeake Bay and was designed to give landowners information they can use about nutrient management products, practices and techniques to assist in Maryland's goal to reduce nutrients 40 percent by the year 2000. The agenda included work sessions on cover crops, precision farming and best management practices, Landowner Referral Service, homeowner practices with an emphasis on household products, lawn care and septic systems, and a special program for youth. Team Chair, Bill Bostian, greeted participants at the opening session and briefly described the purpose of the Tributary Teams. Mark Powell, editor of the Delmarva Farmer, represented the concerns of the local farmer as he spoke to the group. ""It was gratifying to see the number of individuals with an interest in making a difference who were willing to spend the day at our conference. Our speakers, facilitators and cosponsor, the Lower Eastern Shore Heritage Committee, were simply fantastic to work with,"" said Phil Hager, chair of the steering committee. Over 140 participants attended the sessions offered, including representatives of youth groups and local high schools. ""As a resource manager, I have come to expect hearing `the same old thing' at environmental workshops for the general public. This workshop and regulatory agencies, and other professionals. To facilitate that, the county established a ""working group"" of eighteen individuals who met together to discuss and modify the first draft. ""Estuarine areas are particularly vulnerable to the effects of nutrient and sediment loading, which can be side effects of golf courses,"" said Katherine Munson, natural resources planner and lead organizer of the workshop. ""Golf courses also require significant landscape disruption and groundwater withdrawal. Out of recognition of these potential effects, the county, under a grant from Section 319 and Coastal Zone Management, is developing guidelines for golf course development and management. The Section 319 grant enabled the county and the Lower Eastern Shore Tributary Team to provide an educational forum for the entire community-- not just Worcester County's community, but the entire regional coastal community."" Over 100 people, representing the golf industry, the environmental consulting fields, local, state and federal government and citizens' groups, attended the symposium. The entire event was videotaped for broadcast on the local cable station. The Worcester County Planning Commission will consider public comments on the draft at their meeting in mid-December. They alsoo may request that the guidelines be reviewed again by the working group. The finalized set of voluntary habitat and water quality guidelines that were discussed at the symposium will be printed and distributed to the public. Both workshops were supported through a Non-Point Source Program 319 grant from the EPA. Team members have also been involved with development of a pilot project, the Lower Eastern Shore Conservation and Restoration Action Strategy under the Clean Water Action Plan. Team members have helped focus and encourage local resources and program implementation on high priority areas within the Lower Shore. Involvement has included outreach to watershed and community organizations. Team members also will be addressing opportunities for action plan funding in the future.  Presentations at the November symposium, How Human-Based Activities Affect the Chesapeake Bay, were designed to give land owners practical information to help protect water resources.  offered new and exciting information such as precision farming methods as well as practical down-to-earth tips for homeowners which I had never considered. Even if I was on the steering committee!"" said Joan Kean of Somerset County In December, Team members co-sponsored a symposium entitled Environmental Principles for Golf Course Design and Management to (1) share information and understanding of golf course design, management and environmental protection; (2) promote understanding of primary, local, state and federal environmental regulations that impact golf course development; (3) disseminate information about new and innovative practices in golf course design and management; and (4) identify common ground between the golf industry, government and local citizens through discussion of a set of voluntary habitat and water quality guidelines for golf courses in Worcester County and the Delmarva Peninsula. The model used to develop this document was a slim booklet entitled Environmental Principles for Golf Courses in the United States . These general principles have been endorsed by 22 national and regional organizations representing golf, the environment and government. Like the national model, the local draft was produced with significant input from and discussion among representatives of the golf course industry, resource  page 5"

The practices, which include animal waste management systems and constructed wetlands, were the focus of a project carried out as a joint effort of the University of Wisconsin-Cooperative Extension, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the consolidated Farm Services Agency. The East River watershed is in the Green Bay area of northeastern Wisconsin.   Wetlands may be recipient of milkhouse waste   The impacts of milkhouse waste were monitored at different sites along the river. When the data confirmed the need for a viable and cost-effective disposal system for milkhouse waste, the project managers explored the long-term pollution control capability and survivability of small constructed wetlands for this purpose. They also examined the ability of a constructed wetland to remove nutrients and solids in a cold-weather climate that is subject to heavy and intermittent rain events. Once it was determined that the system would be effective and durable, even in Wisconsin's climate, it was recommended as a best management practice (BMP) for treating milkhouse wastes in the East River watershed.   Pipes and a holding tank   The wetland filter system begins with a pipe leading from the milkhouse to a holding tank with a sump pump. Once the waste reaches the tank it remains there until it has accumulated sufficiently to trigger the float control switch. The waste is then pumped to a diverter tank, which directs the effluent to either a settling/flotation tank, which functions as a pretreatment, or directly to the constructed wetlands.     The constructed wetland is a 12-cell system arranged in four parallel rows with three cells in a series in each row. Six of the cells received untreated wastewater; and six, as noted above, received pretreated wastewater. This design made it possible to test the efficiency of the constructed wetland on treated and untreated wastes. In both cases, prior to reaching these cells, the wastewater flows through the weir slot, where samples can be taken automatically or by grab sampling. After flowing through the weir, the waste flows to the first cell, then the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cells, until it reaches the filter strip and exits the treatment system.    Each cell measures 76 feet by 10 feet. The sides slope to a depth of 18 inches. A layer of sand is placed at the bottom of each cell, then a plastic liner (to prevent any possible groundwater contamination), and a second layer of sand above the plastic liner. Topsoil is laid above the sand and each cell has a berm top. Each one also contains several emergent aquatic plant species.   Results       When the data confirmed the need for a viable and cost-effective disposal system for milkhoue waste, the project managers explored the long-term pollution control capability and survivability of small constructed wetlands.         Based on initial results, the constructed wetland does reduce the flow of nutrients in the wastewater. It is probably more effective in the summer months than in the winter when everything is frozen, but further experience and monitoring are necessary to determine if the nutrients trapped in the system remain there, or if they will be flushed from the wetland during spring thaws.     Two other important lessons have emerged from this project. First, samples taken at the beginning of the experiment, that is, before the wastewater enters the wetlands, show that the pretreated wastewater has less nutrient content than the untreated wastewater. However, there is basically no difference between the pretreated and untreated flows when the wastewater exits the wetlands. In this case, pretreatment is probably not necessary.    Second, the system as a whole appears to be overdesigned for the size of the application. During the summer months not enough wastewater is generated to keep all 12 cells of the wetland functioning. The farm operators and project managers agree that the constructed wetlands should be maintained and reconfigured: the pretreatment structure will be dismantled and the wetland will be reduced in size from 12 to 6 cells.

WAV provides educational materials and know-how for local volunteers who want to take action to improve water quality.         WAV provides educational materials and know-how for local volunteers who want to take action to improve water quality.         WAV groups stencil ""Dump No Waste, Drains to River"" messages on storm drains to remind people that refuse dumped into storm drains does not disappear but ultimately flows to a waterbody. Groups in more than 60 Wisconsin communities have stenciled nearly 10,000 storm-drain inlets this year. The program has cooperated with the Lake Michigan Federation, Chippewa and Waukesha County land conservation departments, the Adopt-A-Lake program, the Audubon Society, and the Wisconsin River Alliance in painting the towns in Wisconsin.     Another WAV project involves working with others to help clean up Wisconsin's rivers and streams. For example, teamed with America Outdoors and the Wisconsin River Alliance, WAV recently drew 580 volunteers to streambanks and lakeshores for a full day's work. The three groups distributed information and trash bags to these volunteers who collected over 37,000 pounds of garbage to clean up 267 miles of shoreline.

Disclaimer: The information in this website is entirely drawn from a 1993 publication, and has not been updated since the original publication date. Users are cautioned that information reported at that time may have become outdated.       The History of the Project            Confrontation led to a City commitment to pursue a biological solution instead of more high-tech treatment units to upgrade the treatment system.     Ducks, geese, elk? These are not usual inhabitants of a wastewater treatment system. But in Cannon Beach, Oregon, particularly in the fifteen acres of the wooded wetlands cells of the system, they are a common sight. How did this come to pass?   Let's look a little closer. The City of Cannon Beach had a problem--how to treat and dispose of its wastewater. With much citizen involvement, a cost-effective ecologically-interactive wastewater treatment facility was created. This Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funded ""Innovative/Alternative"" treatment system uses an existing wooded wetland to provide the final stage of the treatment process.         Effluent structures during winter flooding (when wetlands are typically not operated).     Here's the story. The three-celled sewer lagoon complex in existence at the time of the passage of the Clean Water Act of 1972 could not meet the more stringent effluent quality standards set by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). In response to this situation, the City began a Facilities Plan. The completed plan recommended options for system upgrading which met with considerable community opposition.   At this point in 1977, a Sewer Advisory Board was formed. The City of Cannon Beach is a resort community and during the tourist season the population swells from a permanent size of 1,200 to many times that number. Any design considered by the Sewer Advisory Board would have to be able to accommodate these large fluctuations in wastewater flows.         Typical vegetation in the majority of the wetlands (brush, sedges, and ferns).     Confrontation led to a City commitment to pursue a biological solution instead of more high-tech treatment units to upgrade the treatment system. The bureaucratic struggle that ensued lasted eight years and the remarkable result of these meetings was the consolidation of a set of ideas which emerged as yet another facility plan addendum. The issues deliberated included: the use and integrity of the wetlands, elk habitat, chlorination, point of discharge, birdlife, the extent of ecological upset, berming and baffling, fencing costs, and the risks of using new treatment techniques. It is a tribute to the professionals representing the various agencies involved in these meetings that, in spite of diverse and sometimes disparate responsibilities and divergent goals, negotiations took place in a spirit of cooperation and compromise sufficient to allow development of an approvable treatment scheme.   This scheme, the wetlands marsh wastewater treatment system, appeared in draft Facilities Plan Addendum No. 2 in October, 1981 and became final in March, 1982. The Plan subsequently  was adopted by the City Council and approved by all the appropriate agencies through the State Clearinghouse review process. Shortly thereafter, a grant application was completed and submitted to the DEQ and EPA and approval of funding for the project was granted in September, 1982.

The projects, managed by universities and companies in 13 states, will run from one to three years and include research on materials, fuels and chemicals, sensors and controls, and energy conversions. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham said the crosscutting research will advance ""key technology areas, such as solid-state lighting, membranes that produce hydrogen, advanced fuels and chemicals, solid oxide fuel cells, as well as process sensors and controls."" For a list of participating research partners and their projects, see the  DOE press release .    DOE Releases New Test for ""Smart"" Dishwashers   Consumers will get more accurate energy efficiency labeling on new dishwashers, thanks to a new test procedure released by DOE on September 9th. The test, which measures the energy consumption in ""smart"" dishwashers—those with soil sensors—uses three different specified loads of food-soiled dishes to approximate realistic home use. Previous tests used clean dishes that did not trigger the sensors, and therefore did not report dishwasher energy use as accurately as the new test can.   Manufacturers use DOE's test procedures for residential appliances such as dishwashers to calculate the annual energy use and energy cost of every model sold. This energy information provides the core data for the Federal Trade Commission's EnergyGuide labels, which allow consumers to compare the energy efficiency of new appliances. See the  DOE press release .   ""Smart"" dishwashers aren't the only energy-saving innovation available for your kitchen: according to recent tests by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), new magnetic-induction ranges also hold a significant potential for saving energy. The ranges use a high frequency, alternating magnetic field to induce heating in the bottom of iron-based cookware placed on the range. Because energy is transferred directly to the cookware, the ceramic surface of the range stays cool. According to EPRI, the range achieves an efficiency of 92 percent (losing only 8 percent of its energy as waste heat), compared to 72 percent for a standard radiant electric range, 47 percent for a residential gas range, and 30 percent for a commercial gas range. In field tests, commercial kitchens using the range were also cooler, which suggests that they could save on air conditioning costs. See the  EPRI press release .    NIST Awards $24 Million for Fuel Cells, Energy Efficiency, and Solar Power   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, announced 44 new awards through its Advanced Technology Program on September 15th. Among the new awards, eight will go toward advancing fuel cell, solar power, and energy efficiency technologies. Those eight projects comprise a total investment of nearly $51 million, including nearly $24 million in NIST funds.   Four of the projects will focus on fuel cell technologies, including a high-volume manufacturing process for proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells, a miniature direct-methanol fuel cell, a low-cost process for manufacturing gas diffusion layers, and a variety of approaches to reduce the cost of power from fuel cells. In addition, Astronautics Corporation of America will design, build, and test an energy-efficient refrigerator that uses a magnetic refrigerant; General Electric Company and Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. will advance their roll-to-roll technology for manufacturing solid-state lighting devices; and the Ohio Aerospace Institute will lead a joint venture to develop enhanced thin-film capacitors for use in electric vehicles and in power converters for fuel cells. Finally, AstroPower, Inc. will lead a joint venture to produce low-cost, high-purity silicon for use in the solar power industry. See the  NIST press release .   The award is certainly good news for AstroPower, which continues to struggle financially after its July delisting from the NASDAQ stock exchange. In early August, AstroPower laid off 55 employees, reducing its workforce by about 10 percent. See the  AstroPower press release .    Road Rally to Feature a Wide Range of Vehicle Technologies   The Challenge Bibendum, a three-day road rally sponsored by the Michelin Group, comes to Sonoma, California, on September 23rd, ending in San Francisco on the 25th. Promoted as a ""sustainable mobility event,"" the eclectic road show includes a wide variety of advanced vehicles, each of which is subjected to an emissions test and a variety of performance tests. The event draws its ""Bibendum"" name from the company's symbol, also known as the Michelin Man.   Among the vehicles entered in this year's Challenge Bibendum-the second to be held in the United States-are a number of fuel-cell-powered vehicles: a Mercedes-Benz A Class compact car, a Mercedes-Benz bus, two Ford Focus FCVs, a Toyota FCHV SUV, and a Honda FCX. Ford is also showcasing two vehicles that burn hydrogen in internal combustion engines: a Ford Focus H2ICE and a prototype hybrid-electric Ford Focus wagon. Volvo is concentrating on alternative fuels, with two compressed-natural-gas (CNG) bi-fuel vehicles: an S80 sedan and a V70 wagon. Honda is providing its CNG-fueled Civic GX as well as its two hybrid-electric cars: the Insight and the Civic Hybrid. And Toyota is contributing both its 2003 hybrid-electric Prius and a model sure to draw attention, its new 2004 Prius, which goes on sale in October. See the  Press section  of the  Challenge Bibendum Web site .    Washington and Ohio Pursuing New Wind Power Additions   A utility and a group led by a non-profit organization are planning to bring more wind power to Washington State. On September 9th, Puget Sound Energy, a utility serving 1.4 million customers in the state, issued a draft request for proposals (RFP) for 150 megawatts of wind power. The draft RFP is the utility's first step toward achieving its goal of drawing on renewable energy for 10 percent of its power supply by 2013. The company held a public meeting on the draft RFP on September 15th and expects to issue a final RFP in early December; the draft RFP sets January 9th as the due date for proposals. See the Puget Sound Energy  press release  and  RFP .   Meanwhile, the non-profit Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEF) is leading a group that has secured wind-power development rights on about 20,000 acres of land in Klickitat County, in central Washington near the Oregon border. BEF has joined with the members of the Last Mile Electric Cooperative to secure the rights to the windy site, which could host up to 200 megawatts of wind turbines. The participants hope to obtain permits and build a wind project on the site within the next two years. See the  BEF press release .   While big wind power plans are underway in Washington, a wind project under construction in Ohio is small in comparison but large in significance. The state's first utility-scale wind plant, consisting of two 1.8-megawatt wind turbines, is now being built near Bowling Green, just south of Toledo. The 3.6-megawatt wind facility should be operating by the end of this year. See the  press release  from Green Mountain Energy Company.     Advances in Solar Power Aim for a Touchdown   Solar power technologies advance, in many ways, much like a football team marching down the field: while everyone hopes for that big touchdown pass, most progress is actually achieved gradually, through the combined efforts of many people pushing ahead in every way they can. Three recent news items demonstrate the diversity of approaches that are advancing solar power technologies.   Electrical engineers at Princeton University are trying an end-run around conventional techniques that could yield huge yardage. While most solar cells are built from silicon and other inorganic materials, the Princeton engineers are developing organic solar cells—solar cells built around thin films of organic chemicals. Using a new processing technique, with support in part from DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the engineers boosted the efficiency of two-layer organic solar cells by 50 percent. Although organic solar cells currently convert only about 3 percent of the sunlight that hits them into electricity, the Princeton researchers are confident of combining new materials and processing techniques to achieve at least 5 percent efficiency, and possibly as high as 10 percent. Although that would be low compared to silicon solar cells, the low cost of the organic solar cells could make them cost-competitive. See the  Princeton press release .   Another way to advance solar power is to get more value out of each solar cell, an approach that might be compared to finding a way to make your football passes go farther. A promising technique is to integrate the solar cells into buildings, allowing them to serve a function for the building while also producing power. The latest attempt at such building-integrated solar cells comes from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), which has built solar cells into pyramid-shaped devices incorporated between the panes of a window. The devices help shade the interior from the sun's harshest rays, while allowing soft daylight into the building. At the same time, the solar cells in the devices generate power. RPI is currently testing two working prototypes of the window system. See the  RPI press release .   But real football fans know that a good passing game is best matched by the ability to move the ball on the ground. It's not as glamorous, but the game often hinges on those able to inch the ball ahead with sheer muscle. The solar power equivalent may be the process of growing silicon ingots. Crystalline-silicon solar cells still dominate the solar power market, and arguably the hardest part of making them is the process of growing crystalline silicon ingots, which are then cut up into wafers to create solar cells. Shell Solar has been working with the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance to improve the energy efficiency of its crystal-growing furnaces, with considerable success. According to Shell Solar, the company has cut the power use of its furnaces by 30 percent while reducing the time needed to grow a crystal by up to 40 percent. The company has also increased its crystal yield while greatly lowering its use of argon gas. See the  Shell Solar press release .    Energy Connections    DOE and Energy Companies Pursue Greater U.S. Imports of LNG   Liquefied Natural Gas, or LNG, has been a subject of increasing attention since July, when Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham proposed holding a Global Liquefied Natural Gas Summit by the end of this year. About the same time, Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, noted that increased LNG imports could act as a ""safety valve"" to help the U.S. natural gas markets respond to price spikes caused by imbalances of supply and demand within the United States. DOE reiterated that message on September 10th, when it enlisted the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) to help educate energy decision-makers about LNG. See the  DOE press release .   Meanwhile, the U.S. energy industry has been actively pursuing LNG imports. The Cove Point facility in southern Maryland, owned by Dominion, has been reactivated after a 23-year shutdown and received its first shipment in late August. On September 10th, Sempra Energy received approval to build a new LNG receiving terminal near Lake Charles, Louisiana. The company plans to begin construction next year, more than 20 years after the last LNG terminal was built in the United States. The terminal should begin operating in 2007. And Tracebel Electricity and Gas International, which currently supplies about half of U.S. LNG imports, has expanded its LNG terminal in Everett, Massachusetts, and has added two more vessels to its shipping fleet. The company's LNG shipments for the first half of 2003 increased 65 percent compared to the first half of 2002. See the press releases from  Dominion ,  Sempra Energy , and  Tracebel .   Both Sempra Energy and Shell received approvals in August to build LNG terminals in Baja California, Mexico. Shell will import the LNG from an offshore LNG export terminal near Western Australia. The company intends to build a new pipeline from the project to the existing natural gas infrastructure, allowing the new terminal to serve natural gas needs in western Mexico and southern California. ChevronTexaco has similar plans, using an offshore terminal near Baja California, and is also seeking permits for an offshore LNG terminal near the Louisiana coast. And Contango Oil & Gas Company is planning an LNG terminal on Quintana Island, located near Freeport, Texas.

New York City uses alternative fuels in a number of buses, garbage trucks, and light-duty vehicles, and 200 natural-gas taxis operate in the city. DOE coordinates the Clean Cities Program, a locally based voluntary partnership of government and industry. Program partners help deploy alternative fuel vehicles and build supporting alternative fuel infrastructure. See the  DOE press release  and the  Clean Cities Program Web site .   Although the official Earth Day 2003 theme, ""Water for Life,"" seems far afield from energy issues, water conservation also helps to save energy. Energy is used to pump, purify, and heat water, so any action to save water (especially hot water) will also save energy. To learn more about the Water for Life campaign and its connection to energy efficiency, see the  Earth Day Network Web site  and the related  press release  from the Alliance to Save Energy.    Energy Star Awards Honor Energy Efficiency Leaders   DOE and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) presented the 2003 Energy Star Partner of the Year awards on April 15th. The awards highlight the efforts of leading manufacturers, retailers, utility companies, and a variety of state and regional programs that promote energy efficiency and awareness of the Energy Star label.   Leading product manufacturers won Partner of the Year awards in three categories: lighting, appliances, and windows. For lighting, Sylvania won for its large product line of Energy Star-qualified lighting, which experienced an 85 percent growth in sales in 2002. For appliances, Maytag Corporation won for its large and diverse product line of Energy Star-qualified appliances. In 2002, the company introduced new models of Energy Star-qualified appliances in every product category, including a new line of dishwashers. For windows, JELD-WEN Inc. won for its aggressive promotion of the Energy Star label. Eighty percent of the company's windows and doors carry the Energy Star label. See the  DOE press release .   In addition to these top awards, DOE and EPA awarded Partner of the Year awards to 36 other organizations that have been instrumental in promoting energy efficiency and the Energy Star label. See the  EPA press release . The full list is posted on the Energy Star Web site ( PDF 30 KB ).  Download Acrobat Reader .   Energy Star was created in 1992 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promote energy-efficient computers. DOE formed a partnership with EPA in 1996 to expand the scope of the Energy Star labeling program to include highly efficient appliances, residential windows, doors and skylights, compact fluorescent bulbs and fixtures, consumer electronics, heating and air conditioning systems, homes, and more. Today, more than 7,000 organizations have become Energy Star partners and are committed to improving the energy efficiency of products, homes and businesses. See the  Energy Star Web site .    Toyota Unveils Improved Prius as Ford Previews Hybrid Escape   Toyota introduced a new, larger, more powerful Prius on April 16th at the 2003 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS). The 2004 Prius is about 15 percent more fuel efficient than the current model; according to Toyota, the new model will achieve a combined city/highway fuel efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon. At the same time, a new lift-back rear end (somewhat reminiscent of the Honda Insight) and a longer wheelbase moves the Prius up to the midsize category of vehicles. The new Prius also accelerates faster than the current model and meets the California Air Resources Board (CARB) certifications as a Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (SULEV) and a Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (PZEV).   One key to the performance of the Prius is its new Hybrid Synergy Drive, which feeds the battery power through a new high-voltage power converter, supplying 500 volts of electricity to a 50-kilowatt motor. The new high-voltage motor is about 50 percent more powerful than the motor in the current model, and allows the vehicle to operate in all-electric mode for a greater percentage of time. The new Prius is expected to go on sale in fall. See the  Toyota press release  and  Web site .   Also debuting at the NYIAS was the new Escape Hybrid SUV (sport utility vehicle) from Ford Motor Company. Like the Prius, the Escape Hybrid is a ""full hybrid""-able to run on electric power only-and will achieve about 35 to 40 miles per gallon. It will also meet the SULEV and PZEV standards. Ford will begin low-volume fleet production of the Escape Hybrid by year-end, and plans to begin retail sales in late 2004. In addition, Ford announced plans to launch a new midsize sedan, the Futura, in late 2005, and plans to eventually offer a hybrid-electric version of that vehicle as well. See the Ford press releases for the  Escape Hybrid  and the  Futura .   While luxury vehicles, sports cars, and SUVs continue to dominate most auto shows, advanced-technology vehicles are a growing presence. At this year's NYIAS, which runs through April 27th, automakers are displaying four gasoline-electric hybrids, three fuel-cell vehicles, and one hydrogen-fueled internal-combustion vehicle-enough to earn a separate category on the NYIAS Web site. See the ""Alternative Fuel"" category in the NYIAS "" New Vehicle Gallery .""    Tucson Celebrates Earth Day by Opening a Zero-Energy Home   A new home in Tucson, Arizona, that produces as much energy and it uses was introduced to the public on Earth Day, April 22nd. Designed by architect Devereaux and Associates and built by John Wesley Miller Companies, the so-called ""Zero-Energy Home"" combines energy efficiency with solar energy technologies that will meet all its energy needs over the course of a year. The uses of solar energy include solid masonry construction for thermal mass, a 4-kilowatt solar power system, and an integrated solar hot water and space heating system, which uses tankless water heaters as a backup energy source. But the home is by no means Spartan: it also includes a high-efficiency central air conditioning system. According to the NAHB Research Center, the energy performance of the building will be monitored of one year. DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory provided partial funding for the project. See the NAHB Research Center's "" Virtual Press Kit .""   DOE is supporting the construction of a number of zero-energy buildings throughout the country. In late March, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) approved the use of a DOE grant to the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority for the design and construction of six zero-energy homes in Atlantic City. DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) awarded a grant of $75,613 for the project. See the  NJBPU press release .    Penn Doubles Its Wind Power Purchase to 10 Percent   The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) announced on April 21st that it has doubled its purchase of wind-generated power. Penn will now buy 40 million kilowatt-hours of wind power annually from Community Energy Inc.—the largest retail purchase of green power in the nation. The university's new 10-year commitment will lead to the construction of a new wind power facility in Pennsylvania. See the  Penn press release .   Green power sales are also supporting wind power in New York State, where Green Mountain Energy Company (GMEC) has bought all the environmental attributes associated with wind power production from the Madison Windpower facility near Hamilton. The wind power credits will be used to meet the demand for people buying green power through the Niagara Mohawk Renewable Energy Program. See the  GMEC press release .   The credits purchased by GMEC are often referred to as ""green tags""—also known as ""tradable renewable credits""—and are a growing market for renewable energy. As one sign of that growth, the Center for Resource Solutions announced in early April that its Green-e Program has certified the first-ever wholesale broker for green tags. Evolution Markets LLC hopes to make green power transactions easier by helping to build a wholesale market for green tags. See the  Green-e press release .    GE Hydro to Upgrade U.S. Hydropower Plants   Many hydroelectric power plants across the United States are aging and in need of refurbishment, and a growing number of hydropower plant owners are choosing to boost their facilities' power production while updating their equipment. This trend is evident at GE Hydro, a unit of GE Power Systems, which recently announced several hydropower turbine refurbishment contracts. On March 10th, GE Hydro won a $47 million contract to refurbish seven turbines at the John H. Kerr Powerhouse in Boydton, Virginia. The project will increase power production by more than 70 megawatts, or roughly 34 percent. On March 24th, the company won a $7 million contract to upgrade two generators at the Jaybird Hydroelectric Powerhouse in northern California. That project will increase power production from 154 megawatts to 170 megawatts, a 10 percent increase. And on April 7th, GE Hydro entered into an agreement with southern California's Imperial Irrigation District (IID) to evaluate and upgrade that utility's hydropower facilities. The IID generates 84 megawatts of power from 14 hydropower units at seven sites along the All American Canal, which runs from Yuma, Arizona, to California's Imperial Valley. See the GE press releases from March 10th ( PDF 105 KB ), March 24th ( PDF 72 KB ), and April 7th ( PDF 86 KB ).  Download Acrobat Reader .   Meanwhile, concerns about this summer's hydropower production in the Pacific Northwest are gradually easing, as above-average precipitation is bringing snowpack levels and predicted streamflow volumes closer to normal. As noted in the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) ""Power Update"" for April 18th, snowpack above the Dalles Dam is now at 86 percent of normal, and predicted streamflow volumes through July are at 79 percent of normal. In March, the watershed above the Dallas Dam received 75 percent more precipitation than normal. See the BPA report ( PDF 13 KB ).    Site News    PA Windmap   The PA Windmap Web site provides a complete guide to wind energy resources in Pennsylvania. It features an interactive map program that visitors can use to create printable wind maps. PA Windmap is sponsored by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and Conservation Consultants, Inc, a regional nonprofit organization based in Pittsburgh.    Energy Connections    EIA Expects Lower Gasoline Prices this Summer   U.S. motorists will pay less at the pump this summer than they have in recent months, according to a report issued in early April by DOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA anticipates an average price of $1.56 per gallon for regular gasoline, down from peak prices of more than $1.70 per gallon earlier this year. However, the projected prices remain about 17 cents per gallon higher than last summer's average price. See the  EIA press release .   Indeed, the latest figures from EIA, released on April 21st, confirm that gasoline prices are dropping. On average, U.S. gasoline prices dropped 2.1 cents per gallon in the past week, reaching an average of $1.57 per gallon. See the  EIA Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update .

October 23, 2002      News and Events       New Large Wind Plants Slated for New Mexico, California, Iowa, and Colorado    Facing Increasing Interest in Wind Power, BLM Announces New Policy    DOE National Laboratories Garner 24 ""R&D 100"" Awards    DOE Secretary Abraham Hosts ""Renewable Energy Roundtable"" in South Dakota    Sodium Sulfur and Lithium-Metal-Polymer Batteries Show Commercial Promise    Solar-Powered Aircraft Successfully Surveys Coffee Fields           Site News            Renewable Energy Atlas of the West      Energy Connections       Arrest Proves Energy Trading Role in California Power Crisis              News and Events    New Large Wind Plants Slated for New Mexico, California, Iowa, and Colorado   New Mexico will gain its first large wind power plant late in 2003, announced Public Service of New Mexico (PNM) on October 21st. The 204-megawatt New Mexico Wind Energy Center will be built, owned, and operated by FPL Energy, LLC, a leading wind plant developer. The project will feature 135 1.5-megawatt wind turbines and will span the borders of Quay and De Baca counties, about 50 miles west from the center of the state's eastern border. PNM intends to sell some of the wind power to its customers through a green power program, selling any excess wind power on the wholesale power market. Construction will begin this year on the facility, which will generate enough electricity to supply 94,000 homes in the state. See the  PNM press release .    In addition to the New Mexico Wind Energy Center, FPL Energy has several projects in the works, including large wind facilities in northern California and Iowa. In California, the High Winds Energy Center, a 150-megawatt wind plant, is expected to begin commercial operation in mid-2003, providing electricity to PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc. In Iowa, the 98-megawatt Hancock County Wind Energy Center will begin operation this year; Interstate Power and Light Company and several local electric cooperatives and municipal utilities will buy the wind power. Hancock County is located in the north-central part of Iowa, just west of Mason City. The area is already populated by small wind projects in Algona and Forest City, and a 42-megawatt wind project near Clear Lake. See the  Iowa Wind Energy Project  page on the American Wind Energy Association Web site.    FPL Energy will also add 37 megawatts to its Stateline Clean Energy Center, located on the Washington-Oregon border, increasing the total capacity of that wind facility to 300 megawatts. That project will be complete by year-end. For information on all the company's current projects, see the  FPL Energy press release .    Colorado will join the greater-than-100-megawatts wind club next year, thanks to an order issued in early October by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC). Under the order, Xcel Energy will contract with GE Wind Energy, LLC to build a 162-megawatt wind facility near Lamar in southeastern Colorado. The Colorado PUC originally ordered Xcel Energy to pursue a wind facility in February 2001, but the project was jeopardized when Enron Wind Corporation's parent company, Enron Corporation, filed for bankruptcy. A new contract was negotiated successfully after GE Power Systems purchased Enron Wind and committed to move forward with the project. Several parties, including the Land and Water Fund of the Rockies, participated in the contract settlement. See the Land and Water Fund press release ( PDF 195 KB ) and the Colorado PUC order ( PDF 222 KB ).  Download Acrobat Reader .    Meanwhile, on the East Coast, a scientific data tower is now being installed on Horseshoe Shoal, located off the coast of Massachusetts in Nantucket Sound. The structure will provide essential data for a proposed 420-megawatt offshore wind plant proposed by Cape Wind Associates, LLC. On October 8th, the data tower installation overcame a legal challenge that sought to halt the project. See the  Cape Wind press releases .    Facing Increasing Interest in Wind Power, BLM Announces New Policy   With companies showing a growing interest in developing new wind energy projects in the West, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced a new wind energy policy on October 17th. The new policy provides guidance on the timely processing of wind energy right-of-way applications and addresses BLM requirements for land use planning, environmental reviews, and authorization of wind energy projects, as well as land rental fees for such projects.    The BLM, an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior, currently administers 25 wind energy right-of-way authorizations on public lands in California and Wyoming. The sites cover roughly 5,000 acres of land and produce about 500 megawatts of wind power. However, the BLM has recently received about 30 new applications for wind energy projects in Nevada, Idaho, New Mexico, California, Wyoming and Washington. See the  BLM press release , which links to the full policy.     DOE National Laboratories Garner 24 ""R&D 100"" Awards   DOE national laboratories contributed to 24 of the year's top 100 practical applications of science, according to R&D Magazine, which presented its 40th annual ""R&D 100"" awards on October 16th. The awards encompass all industries and are conferred only upon leading-edge products of technical significance that are currently available to license or purchase. Of the nine DOE national laboratories that earned awards, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory garnered the most accolades, having contributed to six of the winning entries. Descriptions of all 100 awardees were published in the  September edition  of R&D Magazine.    A number of this year's R&D 100 awards relate to energy efficiency and renewable energy, including a translucent solar module developed by BP Solar and DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL); a hybrid electric engine developed by Toyota Motor Corporation; a supercapacitor with the energy density of a battery, developed by Telcordia Technologies, Inc.; a technology for removing carbon dioxide from landfill gas, developed by Acrion Technologies, Inc.; a soybean-based plasticizer for polyvinyl chloride plastics, developed by Battelle and the Ohio Soybean Council; and a corrosion-resistant coating for carbon steel tubing in geothermal power plants, developed by NREL, DOE's Brookhaven National Laboratory, Bob Curran & Sons Corporation, and Ticona Corporation. Of particular interest is a high-throughput production process for solar cells, developed by AstroPower, Inc. The company produces its APx-8 solar cells using a lower-quality silicon at a production rate of 3.1 meters per minute. According to the award, the next best competitor's production rate is only 0.02 meters per minute. See the R&D Magazine link above, the  AstroPower press release , and for further information on the two relevant NREL awards, see the  NREL press release .    As R&D Magazine celebrates the 40th anniversary of its R&D 100 awards, DOE is celebrating its 25th anniversary this month. See the  DOE press release .    October is also Energy Awareness Month, and DOE has named this year's theme ""A Secure Energy Future: Conserve Energy to Ensure Affordable, Reliable Power Supplies."" See the  announcement  from DOE's Federal Energy Management Program.    DOE Secretary Abraham Hosts ""Renewable Energy Roundtable"" in South Dakota   Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham hosted a ""Renewable Energy Roundtable"" in South Dakota on October 18th. The forum addressed the Bush administration's energy policy and the latest developments in renewable power production and biofuels. It featured local representatives from the biofuels industry, the South Dakota Corn Growers Association, the South Dakota Rural Electrical Association, wind energy companies, and renewable energy advocates.    ""President Bush and I are convinced that renewable energies must play a large role in meeting our challenging future energy needs and reducing our dependence on foreign oil,"" Secretary Abraham said. ""For every improvement in renewable energy technology we develop, for every new megawatt of electricity or gallon of alternative fuel that is produced, we make our nation a little more secure.""   Secretary Abraham highlighted the recent award of $5.4 million to Broin and Associates Inc. of Sioux Falls to develop a ""Second Generation"" dry mill biorefinery pilot project. The $11.3-million pilot project is a joint effort of DOE and Broin and will be located at Broin's biorefinery in Scotland, South Dakota. See the  DOE press release .     Sodium Sulfur and Lithium-Metal-Polymer Batteries Show Commercial Promise   Two advanced battery technologies-sodium sulfur and lithium-metal-polymer (LMP) batteries-have been in the news recently, indicating that these technologies are making strides commercially.    American Electric Power (AEP) dedicated a sodium sulfur battery system at its suburban office park near Columbus, Ohio, in late September. Sodium sulfur batteries have the advantage of providing very high power outputs for short durations. For instance, the AEP battery system is rated to provide 100 kilowatts of power for about seven hours, but up to 500 kilowatts of power for short durations. AEP claims the system to be the first of its kind in the United States. DOE's Sandia National Laboratories was one of many partners in the project, which will be used to reduce peak power loads and guarantee high-quality power at the office park. See the  AEP press release .    For LMP batteries, a Canadian company called AVESTOR is taking the lead: the company announced in mid-September that it was starting production of the world's first commercial LMP battery at its new plant in Boucherville, Quebec. According to the company, LMP batteries are one-third the size and one-fifth the weight of traditional valve-regulated lead-acid batteries. Although the company's initial product is designed to provide power backup for telecommunications relays, the batteries could also be used in hybrid electric and fully electric vehicles, as well as in utility applications similar to the AEP installation. See the  AVESTOR press release .    But don't write off lead-acid batteries just yet: GNB Industrial Power, part of Exide Technologies, announced on October 11th that it will collaborate with DOE's Sandia National Laboratories to analyze the performance of valve-regulated lead-acid batteries in large battery energy storage systems. The company claims that lead-acid batteries are still the preferred technology for such energy storage systems. See the  Exide Technologies press release .    Solar-Powered Aircraft Successfully Surveys Coffee Fields   For most people, the only connections between the sun and coffee are that the former helps the latter grow, and they are both welcome sights in the morning. But thanks to scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the sun may now have a role in determining when coffee growers should harvest their fields.    In a test of remote sensing from uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs), NASA's solar-powered and remote-controlled Pathfinder Plus airplane hovered for four hours over the island of Kauai on September 30th, relaying 300 high-resolution images of the island's largest coffee plantation to the ground. Despite clouds covering as much as 80 percent of the plantation, the airplane was able to fly over clearings in the clouds and photograph virtually all of the coffee fields. At one point, the aircraft was even controlled by a researcher in California. The photos were provided to the plantation's harvest manager, who can judge the ripeness of the coffee beans in each field by the color. Unfortunately, bad weather limited the test to only a single flight. See the  press release  from the NASA Ames Research Center.    Stan Herwitz, a professor of earth science at Clark University, is the principal investigator for the project. Images of the airplane and the coffee fields, as well as a mission log and other information, are available on his  Clark University Web site .    Future UAVs may be powered by fuel cells, thanks to the Boeing Company. Boeing announced in early September that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency had awarded the company a contract to develop a fuel-cell-based propulsion system for UAVs that will allow them to fly for extended periods of time. See the  Boeing press release .     Site News    Renewable Energy Atlas of the West   This online Atlas profiles wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass power resources in the West using high-resolution maps. An interactive map tool allows you to control your view and printing of the maps.  The Atlas was designed as a resource for policy makers, advocates, landowners, and developers interested in producing electricity from renewable energy. The Land and Water Fund of the Rockies, Northwest Sustainable Energy for Economic Development, Green Info Network, and Integral GIS created the Web site. Sponsors include the Hewlett Foundation and The Energy Foundation.     Energy Connections    Arrest Proves Energy Trading Role in California Power Crisis   Back in 2000 and 2001, when California was facing skyrocketing electricity costs, near-bankrupt utilities, and rolling blackouts, energy analysts struggled to explain the reasons for the crisis. Although many factors contributed to the problems, some analysts pointed to the energy companies themselves, claiming that they used their market power to push electricity prices higher. That viewpoint, which was greeted with some skepticism at the time, was confirmed last week when the former Chief Energy Trader for Enron Corporation agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Timothy N. Belden, who worked in Enron's West Power Trading Division in Portland, Oregon, will admit that Enron's manipulation of California's energy markets was illegal, and has agreed to cooperate in the continuing investigation into the manipulation of California energy markets.    In announcing the guilty plea, U.S. Attorney Kevin V. Ryan said, ""These charges answer the question that has long troubled California consumers: whether the energy crisis was spurred in part by criminal activity. The answer is a resounding yes. The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the Justice Department will bring to justice those who served their own selfish purposes by intentionally and criminally manipulating energy consumers in California and on the West Coast."" See the  press release  from the U.S. Department of Justice.    Another contributor to the crisis was the price and availability of natural gas, which fuels a large percentage of California's power plants. A report prepared in August by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) found ""preliminary indications"" that natural gas prices were manipulated as well. FERC's investigations are continuing. See the  FERC Web site .

Constructed wetlands have long been recognized for their cleansing      abilities and they provide an environmentally friendly and energy efficient      method of treating wastewater. The pilot wetland will test the effectiveness      of wetlands as tertiary treatment, and offer a wildlife habitat and      educational opportunity to the public.         The project was designed and implemented in conjunction with DNR wildlife      biologists based on a plan initiated and approved by them.         ""More than 90 percent of Colorado's native species occupy wetlands for at      least a portion of their lives,"" said Greg Walcher, executive director of      the DNR. ""Efforts by Coors to improve wetlands and our basic understanding      of these critical habitats will not only benefit wildlife, but also provide      another window into what we love most about Colorado for our citizens and      for visitors.""        The design incorporates energy savings and efficiency, water treatment      test cells, wildlife habitat and a public viewing area. Continuous      monitoring of key water quality indicators will evaluate the wetland      performance for removal of nutrients, sediment, and other parameters.         OEMC completed an inventory of all functional constructed treatment      wetlands in Colorado. The project team recorded effective practices and      features, as well as lessons learned from the first generation of      treatment wetlands. From this project, OEMCs goal was to build a wetland      that incorporated the identified best practices. Coors was identified as a      partner because of its commitment to water quality, location and resources      to construct and maintain the wetland, said Rick Grice, executive director      of OEMC. We are thrilled that this demonstration provides such benefits to      the community, environment and wildlife.        Construction of the wetland began in June 2003, and was completed in late      August. The wetland is open to public viewing from the public bike path. The      public viewing area includes informational displays explaining the purpose      of wetlands, including benefits to the public, wildlife, and water quality.         We are fortunate to have committed groups like OEMC and DNR on this      project, said Catherine Adams, vice president and Chief Environmental      Officer for Coors. Hopefully, what we all learn through this project will      lead to improvements in water quality for Colorado.         Coors will submit a comprehensive technical analysis of the wetland in a      report to OEMC and DNR at the conclusion of the study in 2005. The report      will include achieved results, successes and lessons learned, as well as a      copy of the engineering plans and design, photos, wetland performance and      conclusions. The report will be made available to the public by OEMC.

COORS CONSTRUCTED TEST WETLAND      FACT SHEET        What is a constructed wetland?       Wetlands are natural water purification systems. The cleansing      properties identified in natural wetlands can be mimicked in constructed      treatment wetlands. Constructed treatment wetlands are designed to maximize      the natural abilities of wetlands to remove or reduce pollutants from a      variety of wastewater sources.             Size       Two acres  wetted area is 1.7 acres      250,000 gallons per day             Test duration       Two years             Location/Accessibility       The test wetland is located one-quarter mile east of McIntyre Street and      just north of Clear Creek on Coors property in Golden. A public viewing area      that overlooks the wetland is located on the Jefferson County Open Space      bike trail that runs parallel to Highway 58 in Golden.             What is the purpose of the constructed wetland at Coors?       The overall goal of the test wetland will be to investigate wetland      treatment processes and develop design criteria for future treatment      consideration. The wetland will test natural treatment processes for brewery      and domestic wastewater effluent and provide habitat for wildlife.      As water quality standards are adjusted over the next ten years to drive      improvement of water quality, wastewater discharges around the state will      benefit from alternative, cost effective methods for removal of pollutants.                  How does the wetland work?       Wastewater that has been analyzed to ensure it meets discharge permit      limits will flow into two test cells, traveling through marsh, pond and more      marsh in each cell. The flow to the two test cells will be varied to study      treatment times. The vegetation used in the two cells will also be varied to      see what combinations best remove pollutants. The water then flows through a      natural wildlife habitat and back into Clear Creek. The wetland will provide      a natural substitute for tertiary treatment (third-stage treatment) of      wastewater.              What specifically will be studied at the wetland?                Primary criteria that will be investigated include:           nitrogen and phosphorus removal           BOD5 removal           need for plant harvesting           suspended solids removal                         The variables that will be studied include:           type of plants           hydraulic & organic loading rates           subsurface flow operation           anoxic/aerobic zone optimization           impact of temperature           solids accumulation                          ###                   225 East 16th Avenue, Suite 650, Denver, CO     80203    Phone 303-894-2383        Hotline 1-800-632-6662    Fax 303-894-2388                                                                                                                      Rick Grice, Executive Director  Governor's Office of Energy Management and Conservation  225 E. 16th Avenue, Suite 650, Denver, CO 80203        303-894-2383 •  800-632-662 •  TDD: 800-659-2656  •  Fax: 303-894-2388  Send comments, suggestions or questions to:  oemc@state.co.us                               Programs     Residential  |  Commercial & Institutional  |  Agricultural & Rural Prosperity  |  Distributed Generation   Transportation & Alternative Fuels  |  Renewable Energy  |  Waste Management & Recycling   Calendar of Events  |   Press Releases  |   Presentations  |   Publications  |   Media Coverage  |   Links  |   Grants  |  Home   What's New  |   How It Works  |   Success Stories"
GX263-06-3569190	"Earth Celebrate 22 April  Day  Maryland Department of the Environment  MDEnvironment April 1998  Whats Inside... Smart Growth Update....................................2 Wetland Restoration Committee Appointed............3  Maryland To Restore Wetlands by Tony Abar When the first Europeans settled Maryland, the landscape was covered with approximately twice the wetland area that exists today. In fact, some estimates place our wetland losses at more than 70 percent of the original wetland acreage. Throughout Maryland's history, wetlands have been drained and filled to satisfy society's need to expand. Since the 1940s, explosive growth and intensive land use has reduced Maryland's wetlands by approximately 60,000 acres. Today, the value of Maryland's wetlands and the important functions that they serve are generally recognized and appreciated. Wetlands protect water quality, reduce flooding, provide critical habitat for many fish and wildlife species and add diversity and aesthetics to the environment. Yet, as with most valuable natural resources, federal, state and local regulations are still needed to protect and preserve these resources. Under the current Maryland wetland regulations, which has a ""no net loss"" goal, wetland losses are to be avoided wherever possible and unavoidable losses are to be offset through the creation of wetlands to compensate for permitted losses. In May 1997, Governor Glendening established a new goal for the state's wetlands program when he announced an initiative to restore 60,000 acres of tidal and nontidal wetlands. With his announcement, the Governor moved the state's wetlands management goal from ""no net loss"" to one of ""net gain.""

The new vehicles emit nearly 70 percent less hydrocarbons and 50 percent less nitrogen oxides, the principal air pollutants that form ozone, than vehicles now in showrooms. The agreement also will reduce air emissions from most sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks. The added cost will be less than $100 per vehicle. Because the federal Clean Air Act prevents EPA from tightening emission standards from vehicles until 2004, the voluntary agreement will help achieve cleaner air in Maryland and around the country at least five years ahead of schedule. Maryland and other Northeast states have been working hard for years to get the manufacturers to produce cleaner vehicles to reduce the ground-level ozone problems that we experience every summer. With this agreement, the cleaner cars will start to be sold in Maryland and other Northeast states in 1999 and nationwide by 2001. Ground-level ozone, a component of smog, causes coughing and throat irritation, lowers resistance to disease and intensifies heart and lung disease. Especially sensitive are children, the elderly and the more than 600,000 Marylanders that suffer from respiratory problems. It is estimated that air pollution causes 1/4 of the Chesapeake Bay's pollution problems.

In just the past six weeks, the program has been formally recognized by the World Wildlife Fund and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It also has been praised in articles about the high costs of suburban sprawl that have appeared in the Detroit Free Press and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. On January 30, World Wildlife Fund formally recognized the Smart Growth initiative as a ""Gift to the Earth"" as part of the international organization's ""Living Planet Campaign."" In quarterpage advertisements that appeared in both the New York Times and the Washington Post, World Wildlife Fund praised the Smart Growth initiative, the new Rural Legacy Program, and the $200 million Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, a federal-state partnership program designed to reduce nutrient pollution and conserve farmland in Maryland over the next 15 years. ""Under the leadership of Governor Parris Glendening, Maryland has initiated strong action to protect the Chesapeake Bay watershed from the threats of suburban sprawl and agricultural runoff,"" World Wildlife Fund states in its advertisements, which were part of a campaign designed to highlight the struggle to protect the world's most outstanding wildlife and wild places as we enter a new century. On February 27, Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, came to Annapolis to present Governor Glendening with the National Trust's President's Award ""for his model leadership in preserving the economic vitality of the state's older cities and towns against the ravages of wasteful, sprawling development."" Moe said that, ""Under Governor Glendening's leadership, Maryland is blazing new trails by enacting community friendly policies ... [that] bring new vitality to existing communities and curb the loss of pristine open space."" In a February 22 article in the Detroit Free Press, Keith Schneider, executive director of the Michigan Land Use Institute, called Maryland's Smart Growth initiative ""the most promising new tool for managing growth in a generation."" ""It's no longer good enough for Michigan lawmakers to say they don't know how to respond,"" Schneider wrote. ""Maryland has shown the way."" In a front-page series that prodded local officials to do more to combat sprawl, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch used sidebar stories about efforts in Maryland and Portland, Oregon, as examples of reforms the Midwestern states could copy. ""Maryland's Smart Growth law didn't go as far as Glendening had hoped. But it went much further than most states, including Missouri and Illinois,"" the Post-Dispatch wrote. ""Maryland's experience provides a textbook case of how advocates of growth management can prevail over arguments for unfettered development."" with best management practices implemented to achieve a reduction in environmental impacts over more typical development practices (e.g. elimination of ""curb and gutter"" in favor of stormwater drainage systems that take advantage of natural swales in the landscape). But many local rules that govern development have been in place for years, if not decades. These rules, which may have made sense at one time, are now being collectively challenged by those who believe there should be more flexible ways to regulate development. During the workshop, successful Maryland case studies were presented along with examples of the extensive nature of the local review process. Participants even got to try their hand at designing a new community that had to include innovative site design, address environmental concerns, and still maintain marketing objectives. The Patapsco/ Back River Tributary Team hosts were encouraged to find ways to foster wider discussions on these and related smart growth issues of importance throughout Maryland.  Incorporating the Warfield Complex into the Town of Sykesville Sykesville, a town of approximately 3,200 in the southeast corner of Carroll County, will host a planning charrette during the third week in April with a goal to reunite the formerly state-owned Warfield Property with the historic residential and commercial village core through a new comprehensive Master Plan. The Warfield Complex contains approximately 130 acres and more than a dozen historic buildings designed in the 1890s. The creative challenge arises from seeking not only the best possible use of the property, but in unifying the complex to the existing town center. A consultant team of design professionals will facilitate the charrette, which will result in an updated Master Plan for both the town and the redeveloped Warfield site. This project has the potential to serve as a model for the implementation of the Smart Growth Initiative. Charrette criteria will be focussing on meeting Smart Growth goals while solving sitespecific challenges Sykesville and its consultant team is inviting interested design, planning, preservation, development, or related professionals to bring their energy and ideas and participate in the charrette.

Glendening has appointed a 26-member committee of business, agricultural, environmental and government leaders to guide the state's efforts to restore approximately 60,000 acres of Maryland's lost wetlands. By identifying areas suitable for wetland creation or restoration projects, working with landowners on innovative funding options and launching an all-out effort to educate the public this diverse group will help preserve and restore these important natural resources. The committee also will assist state government in the development of a wetlands conservation plan, identify priority protection and restoration areas, provide guidance and technical support for wetlands projects and recommend incentives for wetland creation. ""I am confident that the collective expertise of this steering committee will help us to restore our precious wetlands so that we can once again reap the benefits of these important environmental resources,"" Governor Glendening said.

Maryland's Wetland Restoration This past fall, the Chesapeake Executive Council, which is made up of the governors of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia, the mayor of the District of Columbia, the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the chairman of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, followed Maryland's lead and agreed to set a ""net gain"" goal for wetlands throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Although a large part of Maryland is within the Chesapeake Bay drainage area, the state's wetlands restoration initiative will not be limited to the Bay watershed. Rather, restoration efforts will be statewide, including the Maryland coastal bays watershed, has experienced significant wetland losses. State agencies will maximize support for the wetlands restoration initiative by surveying state properties for opportunities to create wetlands; and wherever appropriate sites are identified, wetlands creation projects will be incorporated in construction plans. Federal and local government agencies will be encouraged to undertake similar efforts. Much of the success of the wetlands restoration initiative will depend on the willingness of landowners, including businesses, conservancies, and individuals, to participate in the effort. If the goal is to be reached, many of the wetlands to be created must be located on private land. Several state and federal agencies administer programs that provide assistance to landowners for wetlands restoration. These programs vary in their provisions as to eligible lands and landowners, type and level of available assistance (technical or financial), and cost-sharing requirements. A number of private organizations also provide technical or financial assistance to landowners to promote the creation of wetlands. The Maryland departments of the Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture are currently compiling information on public and private assistance available for wetlands creation projects. MDE also is developing a program to acknowledge the many organizations and individuals whose wetland creation projects are going unrecognized. This program also will serve as a clearinghouse so that others may learn from successful efforts If you are interested in creating a wetland, we would like to hear from you. MDE has established a ""network"" with other state and federal agencies that will respond to your inquiries, determine the feasibility of establishing a wetland on your property and identify additional potential assistance. Individuals, organizations, and businesses who are interested in undertaking a wetlands creation project, who may provide technical or financial assistance, or who have recently completed a project, are urged to contact Tony Abar, (410) 631-8059, Wetlands Restoration Initiative, 2500 Broening Highway, Baltimore, MD 21224.

Electric-powered vehicles are not a new concept. In the early 1900s, more than 50 manufacturers were building electric-powered vehicles. By the late 1930s, gasoline-powered vehicles had crowded electric vehicles out of the market. It took the energy crisis of the 1970s with its gasoline shortages and warnings of our country's dependence on foreign oil to bring attention back to electric vehicles. In 1989, NESEA organized the first American Tour de Sol. Now in its tenth year, the event boasts an even more major car company entries than ever before, demonstrating just how far the industry has come in 10 short years. Entries for this year's event are broken up into five different categories including a production category, commuter category, hybrid category, solar commuter category and one person category. Some of the vehicles to be included at the event Washington, D.C. offering an unparalleled opportunity to demonstrate and market electric vehicles and other advanced technology vehicles to both businesses and the general public. People will have the opportunity to see solar and electric vehicles as well as other alternative fuel vehicles in motion, to look under the hood, and have a chance to talk to one of the many experts in attendance. The Maryland Department of the Environment is proud to be both a sponsor and organizer of the event in Maryland on May 13. Most vehicles participating in the road rally will arrive at Sandy Point State Park from 11 a.m. to noon. Activities are scheduled from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and the event is free to people of all ages. Stop by and take part in this special event. Please call Ms. Fran Stierstorfer at (410) 631-3012 for more information.  1996 Tour de Sol competitors give tours and answer questions.  will be the General Motors EV1, the worlds first production electric vehicle, and the Toyota Prius, the worlds first production hybrid vehicle. Hybrid vehicles are powered by two different methods, usually electric  motors and a fossil-fuel engine. The Tour de Sol is more than just a road race, it is a traveling fair that is both educational and entertaining for people of all ages. There will be ten events held between New York and  Upper Potomac Tributary Team Works to Reduce Nutrients by Richard Douglas, Upper Potomac Tributary Team Coordinator The Upper Potomac Tributary Team has been in place for more than two years helping to reduce nutrients entering the rivers and streams in Western Maryland, the Upper Potomac River, and, ultimately, the Chesapeake Bay. The team's role includes advising state and local governments on nutrient reduction programs and policies, in particular related to agriculture, wastewater treatment plants, resource protection and urban development practices. The team, one of ten across Maryland has approximately 30 members appointed by the Governor that represent local government, agriculture, business, environmental organizations, citizens and other interests. The Upper Potomac Tributary Basin covers half of Garrett County to the west, half of Carroll County to the east, and all of Allegany, Washington, and Frederick Counties. Thomas Miller, Maryland Cooperative Extension Service, serves as the current team chair, while Elmer Weibley, Washington Soil Conservation District, serves as the current team vicechair. Members of the team not only act as policy advisors but also are involved in education and outreach efforts in the watershed. For example, the team held an erosion and sediment control workshop for Western Maryland developers and contractors in November in Cumberland. The Developed Land Workgroup, one of four team workgroups, concluded that many sediment pollution problems result from a lack of education, and decided to organize this workshop. Alison Rice and Craig Hartsock of Allegany County spearheaded the effort, developing the agenda and identifying speakers. The agenda was organized to encourage the 75 workshop attendees to voice their opinions and ask questions. The morning session, facilitated by Team Chair Thomas Miller and Phil Favero of the University of Maryland, included an overview of the state erosion and sediment control program and local permit procedures, plan requirements, a developer's viewpoint and stormwater management considerations. Team members facilitated table discussions during lunch on erosion and sediment control-related topics, and the workshop concluded with a ""green card"" certification course, given by Rick  Upper Potomac  Trickett of MDE. ""I felt the workshop was a success. Several attendees asked for more workshops in the future,"" said Alison Rice, an Allegany County planner who helped to organize the day's events. ""Many of the contractors attending the workshop received their green card for the very first time and admitted that they didn't realize that it was a requirement in Maryland. ""Everyone learned something at the workshop,"" said Mr. Craig Hartsock, district manager of the Allegany Soil Conservation District ""The workshop was an important first step in educating contractors and developers in Western Maryland on the Tributary Strategies process and the importance  of controlling non-point source runoff from construction sites. I was very impressed with the attitude and concern for the environment that was exhibited by the contractors and developers in attendance."" The Upper Potomac Tributary Team meets on the fourth Wednesday of each month at 6 p.m. at the Western Maryland Research and Education Center in Keedysville. All meetings are open to the public, and visitors are welcomed and encouraged to participate.

By Mardel Knight Back in the 1940s asbestos was touted as the miracle fiber. By the mid-1960s it was used in building construction throughout the nation as insulation, ceiling tiles and fireproofing. By the late-1960s science had proven it was hazardous to our health. Yet, it is a product that is still found in many of Maryland's public buildings, including schools, because removing it is more hazardous than leaving the cancer-causing particles undisturbed. But thanks to a little used public reporting requirement, Maryland parents can find out more about their child's school environment by reviewing the school's asbestos management plan. Federal regulations, known as AHERA (Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act) that went into effect in 1987 requires all schools, both public and private, with the exception of forprofit schools, to have their buildings federally inspected for asbestoscontaining materials and to develop a plan to manage any pre-existing asbestos. In Maryland the covered schools are those that have any grades from preschool through grade 12, quired to correct any deficiencies that including church-exempt schools. All are found.

This annual notification must be completed even if the school has not removed any asbestos or made any other changes. The annual requirement also ensures that any new parents, staff or teachers are appropriately notified. The notification is usually made at the beginning of the school year via the first school newsletter, registration packets, or other school communication tool. The most important part of the management plan is the name, phone number and address of the designated contact person for the school or school district. This person has the special training needed to guarantee that schools are following the AHERA regulations and can help you with any questions that you have about the school's management plan. For assistance in finding contact information for your child's school, contact Mardel Knight or a member of MDE's Asbestos and Industrial Hygiene program at (410) 631-3801.  Rubble Landfill Third Party Checkers by Ed Dexter Maryland's rubble landfills are now required to have a ""third-party checker"" visually inspect every load of waste disposed of at a unlined rubble landfill as part of a unique checks and balances system created by last September's new rubble landfill regulations. These third-party checkers are independent, not part of the chain-of-command at the landfill and have no other responsibilities other than to inspect waste to ensure conformance with regulations and to protect against dumping of inappropriate materials that may harm the environment. Some landfill operators use engineers from commercial consulting companies as third-party checkers; others are using county health department personnel; and some of the counties, which already require commercial facilities to have a county checker on board, are allowing landfill-operator paid employees to fulfill MDE's requirements. In general, the duties of the thirdparty checker are to examine waste as it is received and insure that the waste is free of unacceptable waste, to inform the landfill operator when unacceptable waste is observed and to advise MDE of the occurrence and of the fate of the unacceptable waste. The checker is available to help the landfill operator comply with the landfill's Refuse Disposal Permit, to act as an extra set of eyes for MDE's Solid Waste Program inspectors and to document whether or not unacceptable waste is properly managed. Waste loads that will be rejected include loads observed to contain more than a small amount of unacceptable waste which can be separated out of the load, unacceptable waste which is practically inseparable from the acceptable materials and waste which cannot be readily visually identified. Since the program began January 20, MDE has received numerous reports from third-party checkers at landfills around Maryland. Thirdparty checkers have identified furniture and bags of household waste that they suspect have been tossed into rolloff containers at construction sites while sites are unattended. They also have removed containers of weed killer, pesticides, joint compound and even a 55-gallon drum of ""tar,"" which otherwise could have threatened groundwater resources. Questions concerning this program can be directed to the Solid Waste Program at (410) 631-3424.  Did you know that.... Maryland's Scrap Tire Program has achieved its FY98 goal and cleaned up 1.5 million tires?  page 7   Clip-N-Save!

GX002-03-15437238	"flash floods and floods...    the Awesome Power!    A PREPAREDNESS GUIDE    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service    July 1992    NOAA, FEMA, and The American Red Cross       flash floods    #1 weather-related killer in the United States!    How do flash floods occur?    Several factors contribute to flash flooding. The two key elements are rainfall intensity and duration. Intensity is the rate of rainfall, and duration is how long the rain lasts. Topography, soil conditions, and ground cover also play an important role.    Flash floods occur within a few minutes or hours of excessive rainfall, a dam or levee failure, or a sudden release of water held by an ice jam. Flash floods can roll boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings and bridges, and scour out new channels. Rapidly rising water can reach heights of 30 feet or more. Furthermore, flash flood-producing rains can also trigger catastrophic mud slides. You will not always have a warning that these deadly, sudden floods are coming. Most flood deaths are due to  FLASH FLOODS .    Most flash flooding is caused by slow-moving thunderstorms, thunderstorms repeatedly moving over the same area, or heavy rains from hurricanes and tropical storms.    Occasionally, floating debris or ice can accumulate at a natural or man-made obstruction and restrict the flow of water. Water held back by the ice jam or debris dam can cause flooding upstream. Subsequent flash flooding can occur downstream if the obstruction should suddenly release.        June 9, 1972 Black Hills     Rapid City, SD     15 inches of rain in 5 hours     238 fatalities     $164M in damages     Source: National Weather Service         PLAN AHEAD:    Identify where to go if told to evacuate. Choose several places...a friend's home or a motel in another town, or a shelter.    GO TO HIGHER GROUND!       Know your area's flood risk . For information, call your local National Weather Service office, Red Cross chapter, or local emergency management agency. Check your homeowner's or renter's insurance. Homeowners' policies do not cover flooding. Contact your insurance agent to find out how to get flood insurance.    flooding can occur NATIONWIDE!    Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet, and a depth of 2 feet will float your car!  NEVER  try to walk, swim, or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters,  STOP! TURN AROUND AND GO ANOTHER WAY.    SOME HISTORICAL NWS DATA      Dam Break        May 31, 1889 Johnstown, Pennsylvania...    the worst flood in United States history..    36-40 ft. wall of water...2,200 dead.

Flash Flood Events        June 14, 1990 Shadyside, Ohio...    4 inches of rain in less than 2 hours produced a 30-foot high wall   of water...    26 dead...damages $6-8M.    August 1, 1985 Cheyenne, Wyoming...    6 inches of rain in 3 hours...    12 dead...damages $61M.        Flooding Takes Many Forms...    Flash flooding occurs within 6 hours of the rain event.    Flooding is a longer term event and may last a week or more.    RIVER FLOOD    Flooding along rivers is a natural and inevitable part of life. Some floods occur seasonally when winter or spring rains, coupled with melting snows, fill river basins with too much water, too quickly. Torrential rains from decaying hurricanes or tropical systems can also produce river flooding.    COASTAL FLOOD    Winds generated from tropical storms and hurricanes or intense offshore low pressure systems can drive ocean water inland and cause significant flooding. Escape routes can be cut off and blocked by high water. Coastal flooding can also be produced by sea waves called tsunamis (tsoo-n„ -m z), sometimes referred to as tidal waves. These waves are produced by earthquakes or volcanic activity.    NOTE:  Coastal flooding caused by the storm surge associated with hurricanes is described in publication NOAA/PA 78019, ""Storm Surge and Hurric ane Safety.""    URBAN FLOOD    As land is converted from fields or woodlands to roads and parking lots, it loses its ability to absorb rainfall. Urbanization increases runoff 2 to 6 times over what would occur on natural terrain. During periods of urban flooding, streets can become swift moving rivers, while basements can become death traps as they fill with water.    FLASH FLOODING IN ARROYOS/WASHES    An arroyo is a water-carved gully or normally dry creek bed. Arroyos can fill with fast-moving water very quickly. Flash flooding at this arroyo in Arizona took only 58 seconds to develop.    ICE JAM    Floating ice can accumulate at a natural or man-made obstruction and stop the flow of water.       Environmental Clues...    Listen for.. .        distant thunder runoff from a faraway thunderstorm could be headed your   way.     Look out for.. .        water rising rapidly     Nearly half of all flash flood fatalities are auto related!    In your automobile...        look out for..flooding at highway dips, bridges, and low areas.     MANY FLASH FLOODS OCCUR AT NIGHT...BE PREPARED TO TAKE QUICK ACTION.       How can a foot or two of water cost you your life?        Water weighs 62.4 lbs. per cubic foot and typically flows downstream   at 6 to 12 miles an hour.    When a vehicle stalls in the water, the water's momentum is transferred   to the car. For each foot the water rises, 500 lbs. of lateral force are   applied to the car.    But the biggest factor is buoyancy. For each foot the water rises up   the side of the car, the car displaces 1,500 lbs. of water. In effect,   the car weighs 1,500 lbs. less for each foot the water rises.    Two feet of water will carry away most automobiles .        Before the flood...    What  YOU  can do:        Know your flood risk and elevation above flood stage.    - Do your local streams or rivers flood easily? If so, be prepared to move   to a place of safety. Know your evacuation routes.    Keep your automobile fueled; if electric power is cut off, gas stations   may not be able to operate pumps for several days.    Store drinking water in clean bathtubs and in various containers. Water   service may be interrupted.    Keep a stock of food that requires little cooking and no refrigeration;   electric power may be interrupted.    Keep first aid supplies on hand.    Keep a NOAA Weather Radio, a battery-powered portable radio, emergency   cooking equipment, and flashlights in working order. Install check valves   in building sewer traps to prevent flood water from backing up into the   drains of your home.     Assemble a disaster supplies kit containing: first aid kit, canned food and can opener, bottled water, rubber boots, rubber gloves, NOAA Weather Radio, battery-powered radio, flashlight, and extra batteries.    What YOUR community can do:        Assist hospitals and other operations which are critically affected   by power failure by arranging for auxiliary power supplies.    River/rainfall readings are valuable to local emergency management   agencies (EMA) and the National Weather Service (NWS) in assessing flood   conditions and taking appropriate actions. Advanced warning provided by   early detection is critical to saving lives. Automatic flood detection   systems are available commercially for flood-prone communities. Contact   your local NWS office or emergency management agency for further information   on  LOCAL FLOOD WARNING SYSTEMS .        STAY INFORMED ABOUT THE STORM    by listening to NOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio, and television for the latest flash flood/flood  WATCHES, WARNINGS, and ADVISORIES.         NOAA WEATHER RADIO IS THE BEST MEANS TO RECEIVE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE.  The National Weather Service continuously broadcasts updated weather warnings and forecasts that can be received by NOAA Weather Radios sold in many stores. Average range is 40 miles, depending on topography. Your National Weather Service recommends purchasing a radio that has both a battery backup and a tone-alert feature which automatically alerts you when a watch or warning is issued.    What to Listen For...        FLASH FLOOD OR FLOOD WATCH: Flash flooding or flooding is possible   within the designated WATCH area be alert.    FLASH FLOOD OR FLOOD WARNING: Flash flooding or flooding has been reported   or is imminent take necessary precautions at once.    URBAN AND SMALL STREAM ADVISORY: Flooding of small streams, streets,   and low-lying areas, such as railroad underpasses and urban storm drains,   is occurring.    FLASH FLOOD OR FLOOD STATEMENT: Follow-up information regarding a flash   flood/flood event.     The rule for being safe in a flooding situation is simple:  HEAD FOR HIGHER GROUND AND STAY AWAY FROM FLOOD WATERS!       TAKE ACTION!    When a flash flood  WATCH  is issued Be alert to signs of flash flooding and be ready to evacuate on a moment's notice.    When a flash flood  WARNING  is issued for your area, or the moment you realize that a flash flood is imminent, act quickly to save yourself. You may have only  SECONDS !    Go to higher ground Climb to safety!        Get out of areas subject to flooding. This includes dips, low spots,   canyons, washes, etc.    Avoid already flooded and high velocity flow areas. Do not attempt   to cross flowing streams.    If driving, be aware that the road bed may not be intact under flood   waters. Turn around and go another way. NEVER drive through flooded roadways!    If the vehicle stalls, leave it immediately and seek higher ground.   Rapidly rising water may engulf the vehicle and its occupants and sweep   them away. Remember, it's better to be wet than dead!    Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood   dangers.    Do not camp or park your vehicle along streams and washes, particularly   during threatening conditions.     When you receive a  FLOOD WARNING :        If advised to evacuate, do so immediately.    Move to a safe area before access is cut off by flood water.    continue monitoring NOAA Weather Radio, television, or emergency broadcast   station for information.     During the flood:        Avoid areas subject to sudden flooding.    If you come upon a flowing stream where water is above your ankles,   STOP! Turn around and go another way.    Do not attempt to drive over a flooded road. The depth of water is   not always obvious. The road bed may be washed out under the water, and   you could be stranded or trapped.    Children should NEVER play around high water, storm drains, viaducts,   or arroyos.     After the flood:        If fresh food has come in contact with flood waters, throw it out.    Boil drinking water before using. Wells should be pumped out and the   water tested for purity before drinking. If in doubt, call your local public   health authority.    Seek necessary medical care at the nearest hospital. Food, clothing,   shelter, and first aid are available from the Red Cross.    Do not visit disaster areas. Your presence might hamper rescue and   other emergency operations.    Electrical equipment should be checked and dried before being returned   to service.    Use flashlights, not lanterns, torches or matches, to examine buildings.   Flammables may be inside.    Report broken utility lines to appropriate authorities.        FAMILY DISASTER PLAN    Families should be prepared for all hazards that affect their area. NOAA's National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the American Red Cross urge each family to develop a family disaster plan.    Where will your family be when disaster strikes? They could be anywhere at work, at school, or in the car. How will you find each other? Will you know if your children are safe? Disasters may force you to evacuate your neighborhood or confine you to your home. What would you do if basic services water, gas, electricity or telephones were cut off?    Follow these basic steps to develop a family disaster plan...        I. Gather information about hazards.  Contact your local   National Weather Service office, emergency management or civil defense   office, and American Red Cross chapter. Find out what type of disasters   could occur and how you should respond. Learn your community's warning   signals and evacuation plans.         II. Meet with your family to create a plan . Discuss the   information you have gathered. Pick two places to meet: a spot outside   your home for an emergency, such as fire, and a place away from your neighborhood   in case you can't return home. Choose an out-of-state friend as your ""family   check-in contact"" for everyone to call if the family gets separated.   Discuss what you would do if advised to evacuate.         III. Implement your plan.           (1) Post emergency telephone numbers by phones;      (2) Install safety features in your house, such as smoke detectors and     fire extinguishers;      (3) Inspect your home for potential hazards (such as items that can move,     fall, break, or catch fire) and correct them;      (4) Have your family learn basic safety measures, such as CPR and first     aid; how to use a fire extinguisher; and how and when to turn off water,     gas, and electricity in your home;      (5) Teach children how and when to call 911 or your local Emergency Medical     Services number;      (6) Keep enough supplies in your home to meet your needs for at least three     days. Assemble a disaster supplies kit with items you may need in case     of an evacuation. Store these supplies in sturdy, easy-to-carry containers,     such as backpacks or duffle bags. Keep important family documents in a     waterproof container. Keep a smaller disaster supplies kit in the trunk     of your car.        A DISASTER SUPPLIES KIT SHOULD INCLUDE:           A 3-day supply of water (one gallon per person per day) and food that     won't spoil      one change of clothing and footwear per person      one blanket or sleeping bag per person      a first aid kit, including prescription medicines      emergency tools, including a battery-powered NOAA Weather Radio and     a portable radio, flashlight, and plenty of extra batteries      an extra set of car keys and a credit card or cash      special items for infant, elderly, or disabled family members.                IV. Practice and maintain your plan . Ask questions to   make sure your family remembers meeting places, phone numbers, and safety   rules. Conduct drills. Test your smoke detectors monthly and change the   batteries at least once a year. Test and recharge your fire extinguisher(s)   according to manufacturer's instructions. Replace stored water and food   every six months.     LOCAL SPONSORSHIP: NOAA/PA 92050 ARC 4493"

INTRODUCTION This manual is designed to help enhance Maryland's high school students' understanding of urban nonpoint source pollution and how they can become stewards of the environment. The manual illustrates how many normal daily activities can affect the safety of air, water, land, and health. It shows how practicing good household management can make a difference to the environment before costly pollution occurs. It provides information on why, individually and collectively, it is important to: choose environmentally friendly products for the home and garden, recycle and reuse, whenever possible, dispose of hazardous waste properly, compost yard waste, and apply fertilizer, herbicides, and insecticides carefully to decrease contamination to ground and surface waters - to name a few. The economic impact of urban nonpoint source pollution is immeasurable. Millions of dollars are spent each year by state and local governments and private businesses in an effort to protect and restore Maryland's natural resources. This fifth issue training document will educate students about nonpoint source pollution found in urban households (i.e., home sites under 5 acres). The document will describe urban nonpoint source pollution caused by urban runoff and will focus on erosion and sediment control, land clearing, stormwater management, septic systems and drinking water. It will further discuss designing green buildings with energy and water conservation, pollutants found inside the house as well as on the outside of the house, and measures to reduce pollution such as recycling, proper waste disposal and automobile maintenance, and lawn and garden care. It will provide specific information about air issues that affect urban environments. Finally, the training document will identify the local, state, and federal agencies involved in monitoring and regulating urban nonpoint source pollution.  1   II.

It should be noted that additional sources of pollutants other than urban nonpoint source pollution threaten our environment. To offer a broader understanding of pollutants beyond the household, some examples of point and nonpoint source pollutants, as well as types and causes of urban nonpoint sources, and agricultural vs. nonpoint source pollution are outlined below.  The presence of a substance in the environment, that because of its chemical composition or quantity, prevents the functioning of natural processes and produces undesirable environmental and health effects.  Pollution  A source of pollution that can be attributed to a specific physical location.   Industrial discharges of toxic chemicals in the air, land, and water; Excess nutrients from sewage treatment plants.  Point Source Pollution  A diffuse source of pollution that cannot be attributed to a clearly identifiable, specific physical location of a defined discharge channel.       Excess fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides from agricultural lands and residential areas; Oil, grease, and toxic chemicals from urban runoff and energy production; Sediment from improperly managed construction sites, crop and forest lands, and eroding streambanks; Salt from de-icing roads and sidewalks, saltwater intrusion from irrigation practices, and acid drainage from abandoned mines; Bacteria and nutrients from livestock, pet wastes, and faulty septic systems; and Atmospheric deposition and hydromodification ( hydromodification is the alteration of the environment by man, thereby affecting the natural flow of water. Examples include channelization dams, levees and shoreline erosion control).  Nonpoint Source Pollution  Source: www.epa.gov/OWOW/NPS/mmgi/chapter6/indes.html 3   Types of Urban Nonpoint Sources Pollution sources which people can control, and manage effectively, include domestic, agricultural, urban, and industrial activities. Each category can pollute both surface and groundwater. Contaminants include a variety of physical, chemical, and biological substances (such as eroded soil, dissolved nutrients, and bacteria). However, because the soil can physically filter most undissolved substances from percolating water, generally only dissolved contaminants and bacteria actually reach groundwater supplies. Both dissolved and undissolved substances can reach surface supplies. Contaminants that originate around the home include chemicals used on lawns and gardens and pesticides used around foundations. One of the greatest potential domestic source of groundwater contamination is from septic tanks. Though not a surface contaminant, effluent from septic systems can contaminate surface water supplies if improper design and/or maintenance procedures are followed, or if the surface supplies are located too closely to septic systems. Septic systems are used in 20 million (29 percent) households throughout the country. Nitrates from these systems move readily through soil and can reach groundwater in significant amounts. Nitrates are a major nutrient problem for the Chesapeake Bay. Excess nitrates over the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) in drinking water can cause nitrate toxicity, or methemoglobinemia. The disease, primarily affects infants under four months of age by reducing levels of oxygen in the blood, hence the name, blue ""baby syndrome"". Source: MDE Facts About . . . Nitrates in Drinking Water and Your Health (at end of Septic Systems and Drinking Water Section) Household chemicals, such as paints and paint thinner, degreasers, polishes, cleaning solvents, and even waste oil from home automobile oil changes are also potential threats to groundwater. Many of these products are disposed of improperly by being flushed down the toilet or poured down a drain. When poured down the drain, the substances make their way to the drain field of the septic system, where they can leach into the groundwater. Septic tank cleaners are of particular concern, since many of these contain toxic organic chemicals that can leach through the soil. Household chemicals and waste oil can also move readily through the soil even if they have been spread on the soil surface. Small quantities of these materials in a water supply can cause severe contamination. 4   Fecal wastes from both domestic and wild animals (for example, bird droppings on rooftops) and eroded soil are a major contaminant of surface water. When pet waste is washed into lakes or streams, the waste decays, using up oxygen and sometimes releasing ammonia. Low oxygen levels and ammonia combined with warm temperatures can kill fish. Pet waste also contains nutrients that encourage weed and algae growth (Attached under Household Care - Exterior).

Major causes of Urban Nonpoint Source Pollution Urban areas can contribute the same contaminants to surface runoff as rural domestic areas. In addition, runoff from urbanized areas can carry any number of organic and inorganic chemicals, including oils, greases, and various metals which wash from streets and parking lots. Construction activities in urban areas contribute large amounts of sediment.  Urban areas also can contribute to groundwater pollution from wastewater treatment plants, storm water collection basins, leaking sewer pipes and landfills. A wide variety of pollutants are associated with these activities. Many active and inactive landfills throughout the country are unlined and not monitored to determine if leachate is moving from the landfills. Storm water catchments collect runoff during rainfall events and ""dispose"" of the runoff by having it infiltrate into the soil. If the storm water contains dissolved contaminants, the soil will provide only slight treatment and the contaminants can percolate to the groundwater supply.  5   Treated industrial wastes are also usually discharged directly to receiving streams. The contaminants such effluents contain depend on the nature of the industry. These can range from easily degraded organic matter to more resistant chemicals and bacteria.  Agricultural/Rural vs Urban NPS Pollution The major contributors of water pollution from agriculture are eroded soil, animal wastes, fertilizers, and other agrochemicals. By volume, eroded soil is the largest agricultural pollutant of surface water supplies. Nevertheless, pesticides, nutrients (especially phosphorus attached to eroded soil), and animal waste applied to the land can be transported to surface supplies by runoff. Storage and application of manures and fertilizers also have contributed to increased nitrate levels in groundwater nationwide. In many areas, nitrate levels are above drinking water standards for ""safe"" water. Improper storage of manure and over application of manure and fertilizers have a significant impact especially in Coastal Plain areas. In these areas, vast acreages could percolate nitrate nitrogen into the groundwater. Waste storage ponds and lagoons also have the potential to contribute to groundwater pollution. In fractured bedrock and limestone areas with sinkholes and caves (karst formations), these structures, if improperly sited and/or constructed, can deliver contaminants directly to groundwater. In karst settings, a pond can empty completely overnight. Careful management and proper siting can greatly alleviate many of the problems associated with these sources of agricultural water pollution. Source: The Maryland HomeWork Program.

You could be affecting water miles and miles away. But even more likely, you are impacting water quality right in your own backyard...Even if you have municipal water (city water), you can still pollute the water you drink. Your yard is likely to be in the same watershed as your drinking water supply. Remember the phrase ""you are what you eat""? Well, what you put in your yard, you drink! Watershed  land that water flows across or under on its way to a stream, river or bay. When it rains, water seeps into the ground and flows across the surface, eventually draining to a low point  such as a wetland, creek or bay. All the land area that drains to this low point is defined as its watershed. Watersheds come in many different shapes and sizes. The Chesapeake Bay watershed stretches across parts of six states, extends 64,000 square miles and is home to 14 million people. Like all large watersheds, the Bay's watershed is made up of thousands of smaller watersheds that drain into its tributaries. For example, the Monocacy River watershed is part of the larger Potomac River watershed, which in turn is part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. In Maryland, nearly 95 percent of the State is part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. To develop regional nutrient reduction plans the State divided its Bay watershed into 10 Tributary basins. Tributary Teams, made up of local residents in each of these basins, are working to protect water quality and habitat. Chesapeake Bay Watershed - consists of an extremely diverse landscape of 64,000 square miles drained by an intricate network of freshwater and tidal rivers and streams. The Bay's watershed embraces six states: New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, Maryland, and Virginia and the District of Columbia. It covers territory from the Appalachian Province through the rolling Piedmont Plateau, down to the flat Atlantic Coastal Plain. Nonpoint source pollution from many different sources within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, usually associated with rainfall runoff moving over and through the ground, carry natural and manmade pollutants into lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands, underground drinking water, and to our estuary and coastal waters. 7   Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) - is an estimate of the maximum amount of a given pollutant that a body of water can assimilate without violating water quality standards. This total load includes pollutants that come from the end of a pipe (point source), and from stormwater runoff and ground water flow (nonpoint sources), as sell as a ""margin of safety,"" which provides a cushion needed because of uncertainties naturally associated with estimates. A TMDL also may include an allowance for future increases in pollutant loads due to changes in land use, population growth and the expansion of business activities.

HISTORY Maryland's Nonpoint Source Control Efforts In the broadest sense, Maryland has had a long history of nonpoint source (NPS) problem recognition. Earliest records of this can be traced to colonial days, when regulatory actions attempted to address serious NPS problems that had arisen in Tidewater areas as the result of massive clearing of land and intensive cultivation of tobacco-the leading colonial cash crop. In 1679, for example, the Virginia colony delegated to its tidewater colonies the power to ""clear the rivers from logs and trees, which may annoy and endanger boats, and sloops."" 1 This authority to remove navigational impediments can be thought of as an attempt to treat one of the more extreme ""symptoms"" of nonpoint source pollution, though doing nothing to alleviate the cause of the problem! Deforestation continued, extending into the Piedmont uplands. This led to even more dramatic impacts as a result of increased freshwater flows during storms. Destructive freshets (the sudden rise or overflow of a stream) reached a peak during colonial times in 1771, with a flood that submerged many Tidewater river towns and ruined acres of fertile land with deposits of sand and stones. 2 The loss of navigational river miles in many parts of Maryland due to the greatly accelerated process of siltation is a well-known historical fact. The recent history of NPS control efforts in Maryland can be traced to 1938, with the creation of the State Soil Conservation Committee (SSCC) and the twentyfour independent soil conservation districts (SCDs). At the time of their creation, the SSCC and the SCDs were primarily concerned with soil conservation as a necessity for the long-term viability of Maryland agriculture. Nevertheless, early efforts by these groups laid the foundation for subsequent agricultural NPS control efforts specifically aimed at protecting and improving water quality. The State's shore erosion control cost-share program, created in 1968, is another example of a program that stemed more from a concern for protecting the public from imminent danger and loss of property values than from a concern for the NPS impact of shoreline sediments on water quality and aquatic habitats. 1  Middleton, Arthur Pierce, Tobacco Coast: A Maritime History of Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era , The John Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD c. 1984 (reprinted) 2 Ibid. p. 58  9   Nonetheless, recent studies by the State and by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have confirmed some 4.7 million cubic yards of sediment are eroding from the Chesapeake Bay shoreline in a typical year. This amounts to about 50% of all sediment entering the Bay annually. In 1970, the Maryland General Assembly enacted the Sediment Control Law, the first such state legislation in the country. This law clearly noted the connection between erosion and the pollution of the State's waters, along with the subsequent impairment of beneficial uses. Then, in 1971, the State's Attorney General ruled that stormwater management may be required within the context of the Sediment Control Law. Clearly, the concern for NPS assessment and control had taken root in Maryland. Water quality planning work performed under Section 208 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 increased recognition of NPS problems. Under Section 208, the State prepared its first statewide agricultural water quality management (WQM) program and individual WQ plans for 12 ""nondesignated"" river basins. The Patuxent River basin plan was the first such plan to contain actual NPS reduction goals, which they addressed nutrients believed to be negatively impacting the Patuxent estuary. By 1982, the General Assembly became firmly convinced that the State needed to be more aggressive in controlling NPS pollution from both farmland and areas undergoing development. that year, both the Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share (MACS) program and the State Stormwater Management laws were enacted. The completion of the $27 million EPA Chesapeake Bay research effort (1977 83) and signing of the first Chesapeake Bay Agreement in 1983 shed considerable new light on the importance of nonpoint sources (relative to point sources) to the water quality of the Bay and its tributaries. Nutrients, sediment and, to a more limited extent, toxics carried by surface runoff and conveyed by groundwater are believed to be important causes of water quality and living resource degradation in the Bay, to which some 95% of the State ultimately drains. Subsequent to the signing of the 1983 Agreement, Maryland adopted a comprehensive set of initiatives, many of which dealt with improving management of nonpoint sources. Pre-existing programs, such as the sediment and erosion control program, were amended and some new programs were created. For example, 1984 10   marked the creation of new demonstration programs for urban stormwater management ""retrofitting"" and nonstructural shore erosion control techniques. In addition to the designation of agricultural ""priority"" watersheds for NPS control, the State also defined as ""critical"" a 1000-foot management area encircling the Bay and tidal portions of the tributaries. Local governments in Maryland worked hard to refine and implement the required management programs for this Chesapeake Bay Critical Area. Approximately $10.8 million in State capital and operating funds were appropriated for the enhancement of NPS efforts in 1984. In addition, by 1985, the State had begun receiving Federal Bay Implementation Projects grant funds, which are dedicated to nonpoint source control efforts around the Bay. Maryland co-signed the 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement, which included an unprecedented commitment to reduce nitrogen and phosphorous loads to the Bay by 40%, using 1985 as the baseline year. The 1987 Agreement also called for improving the control of ""conventional pollutants"" and toxics. The State has developed a nutrient reduction strategy that incorporates both point and nonpoint source elements. For more than 300 years, the Bay and its tributaries have sustained the region's economy and defined its traditions and culture. It is a resource of extraordinary productivity, worthy of the highest levels of protection and restoration. In 1983 and 1987, the states of Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, the Chesapeake Bay Commission and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, representing the federal government, signed historic agreements that established the Chesapeake Bay Program partnership to protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay's ecosystem. For almost two decades, the signatories to these agreements, have worked together as stewards to ensure the public's right to clean water and a healthy and productive resource. They have sought to protect the health of the public that uses the Bay and consumes its bounty. The pursued initiatives have been deliberate and have produced significant results in the health and productivity of the Bay's main stem, the tributaries, and the natural land and water ecosystems that compose the Chesapeake Bay watershed.  11   The 2000 Agreement, commits the signatories to nurture and sustain a Chesapeake Bay Watershed Partnership and to achieve the specified goals. Without such a partnership, future challenges will not be met. With it, the restoration and protection of the Chesapeake Bay will be ensured for generations to come. The new agreement is designed to renew the historically significant 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement, the document that set the 15-year-old restoration effort in motion. Once signed, Chesapeake 2000 will guide the Bay Program partnership from 2000 to 2010.

Clean Water Act Vision Statement Maryland's vision is to implement dynamic and effective nonpoint source pollution control programs. These programs are designed to achieve and maintain beneficial uses of water; improve and protect habitat for living resources; and protect public health through a mixture of water quality and/or technology based programs; regulatory and/or non-regulatory programs; and financial, technical, and educational assistance programs. Clean Water Act and the Nonpoint Source Section 319(h) Program Federal Clean Water Act In 1972, Congress enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act in response to growing public concern for serious and widespread water pollution. The 1972 law built upon previous federal water pollution statutes. In 1977 the act was amended and renamed the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act was reauthorized in 1991. The Clean Water Act is the primary federal law that protects our nation's waters, including lakes, rivers, aquifers and coastal areas.  12   The Clean Water Act's primary objective is to restore and maintain the integrity of the nation's waters. This objective translates into two fundamental national goals:  eliminate the discharge of pollutants into the nation's waters, and  achieve water quality levels that are fishable and swimmable. The Clean Water Act focuses on improving the quality of the nation's waters. It provides a comprehensive framework of standards, technical tools and financial assistance to address the many causes of pollution and poor water quality, including municipal and industrial wastewater discharges, polluted runoff from urban and rural areas, and habitat destruction. For example, the Clean Water Act:  requires major industries, to meet performance standards to ensure pollution control;  charges states and tribes with setting specific water quality criteria appropriate for their waters and developing pollution control programs to meet them;  provides funding to states and communities to help them meet their clean water infrastructure needs; and  protects valuable wetlands and other aquatic habitats through a permitting process that ensures development and other activities are conducted in an environmentally sound manner. The 1987 Clean Water Act and the development of the Section 319(h) Nonpoint Source Management Program Congress amended the Clean Water Act (CWA) in 1987 to establish the section 319 Nonpoint Source (NPS) Management Program to help focus state and local NPS control efforts. Nonpoint source pollution is runoff caused by stormwater (rainfall or snowmelt) or irrigation water moving over and through the ground. As this runoff moves, it picks up and carries away pollutants, such as sediments, nutrients, toxics, and pathogens. Potential sources of nonpoint pollution are agricultural runoff, urban stormwater runoff, mining, forestry, septic systems, recreational boating, and construction. Agriculture and urban lands comprise 53% of Maryland's land use and generate significant amounts of nonpoint pollution (especially nitrogen and phosphorus). These pollutants are eventually deposited into ground water, lakes, rivers, wetlands, and coastal waters.

RUNOFF MANAGEMENT Runoff Control Measures Water is one of the most remarkable compounds in nature. Most of the features and processes of our physical environment-the atmosphere, soil, and all living things  ultimately depend upon its unique properties. Water absorbs more substances than any other liquid, and it is this property that helps make the Bay (or any water body) a chemical repository. It is this property that sustains the process of erosion and sedimentation - the constant washing and sweeping away of minerals, salts, chemicals, sand, silt, and soil from the land into nearby streams, rivers, and the Bay. We are an integral part of this process. Every time we wash our hands, clean our drains, or water our lawns, we add our wastes and excesses to the water eventually flowing into our streams. Heavy sediment loads in the Bay and its tributaries are now a major form of pollution, threatening the aquatic life that depends on clean water to survive. Continuous accumulation of toxic products from home use threaten fish and shellfish, and ultimately threaten our enjoyment of Maryland waterbodies for swimming and recreation. Fertilizers can deprive the Bay and it's tributaries of the oxygen needed to support life. The additional fertilizer introduces unneeded nutrients that produce excess algae. When the algae dies, it robs the oxygen from the water killing aquatic organisms. Our homes are indeed pathways to the Bay and it's tributaries. Site Plans Site plans are an important runoff control measure. Vegetation, including trees and grass, serve a significant role in protecting the Bay and its tributaries. Construction of homes often involve land clearing activities that destroy these natural defenses, thereby allowing eroded soil and excess nutrients to enter surface and groundwater. Maryland's Sediment and Erosion Control laws and regulations require the development of site plans prior to the beginning of land clearing activities in an effort to m minimize any potential impact to the environment. 14   Developing site plans begins with gathering, mapping, and analyzing information about the physical characteristics of the site. Designers must visit the proposed development site so that its topographic, vegetative, drainage and soil characteristics are clearly understood. Relying exclusively on topographic maps, soils maps, and other materials found in the office without field verification is not an acceptable planning technique. The topography of the site, mapped at suitable contour intervals, will allow the identification of drainage patterns, slopes, and sensitive features. Mapping the flow of water onto, through, and off the site enables the delineation of drainage areas. Several interim drainage plans may be necessary to show changing drainage area boundaries as the site is graded. Concurrent phased plans will have to be developed to adjust the soil erosion and sediment controls to the changing drainage patterns. Investigating the site soil characteristics will identify areas suitable for infiltration as well as highly erodible areas, which should be left undisturbed if possible. Areas where vegetation is to be preserved, such as long or steep slopes, highly erodible soils, and buffer strips along water bodies, should be mapped. Downstream wetlands, lakes, streams, streets, or other areas particularly sensitive to damage from erosion and sedimentation should also be investigated and mapped. After the site's topographic, drainage, soils, and vegetative characteristics are mapped, a site development plan that minimizes environmental hazards can be developed. Clearly, the most effective way to minimize the likelihood of sediment pollution is to minimize the opportunity for erosion to occur. The best way to reduce the amount of erosion that occurs is to reduce the amount of area that is exposed and the time that it is exposed. Stabilization of disturbed areas must occur as soon as work has stopped. To limit grading, plan to utilize the existing terrain by locating buildings and roads so that existing contours are followed as much as possible. Preserve natural vegetation wherever feasible. By reducing the need for grading in this fashion, the amount of erodible area, and the corresponding need for sediment control measures, is also reduced. Planning the site development so that grading is minimized facilitates the development of a soil erosion and sediment control plan that is appropriate and cost effective for the site.

Erosion and Sediment Control Sediment Damage Over four billion tons of sediment are estimated to reach the ponds, rivers and lakes of our country each year. Approximately 10 percent of this amount is contributed by erosion from land undergoing highway construction or urban land development. Roughly one billion tons of this sediment are actually carried all the way to the oceans. Sediment yields in streams flowing from already urbanized drainage basins vary from approximately 200 to 500 tons per square mile per year. In contrast, areas undergoing urbanization often have sediment yields of from 1,000 to 100,000 tons. It is easy to comprehend the tremendous quantity of sediment reaching our streams and rivers annually since an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 acres of land in the U. S. are currently undergoing development for housing, industrial sites, and highway construction every day. For very small areas, where construction activities have drastically altered or destroyed vegetative cover and the soil mantle, sediment derived from one acre of land may exceed 20,000 to 40,000 times that generated from an adjacent undeveloped farm or woodland in an equivalent period of time. Deposition of sediment tends to occur as the velocity of sediment transporting streams decreases. Excessive quantities of sediment cause costly damage to water areas and to private and public lands. Obstruction of stream channels and navigable rivers by masses of deposited sediment reduces hydraulic capacity which, in turn, causes an increase in subsequent flooding and a consequent increase in flood damages - frequently with attendant personal injuries and deaths. Sediment fills drainage channels, especially along highways and railroads, and plugs culverts and storm drainage systems thus necessitating frequent and costly 16   maintenance. Municipal and industrial water supply reservoirs lose storage capacity, navigable channels must continually be dredged, and cost of filtering muddy water preparatory to domestic or industrial use becomes excessive and sometimes exorbitant. The added expenses of water purification in the United States amounts to millions of dollars each year. The negative impact on aquatic organisms due to large influxes of sediment into waterways is substantial. The initial effect is a drastic reduction in the number and density of benthos. Aquatic vegetation is often destroyed, either by burial or reduction of sunlight essential for growth. Many species of fish, dependent on bottom organisms for food, or plant life for refuge, are threatened by the damaged habitat. The reduction of sunlight from suspended sediment impairs primary production (the process by which sunlight is utilized by certain organisms to produce carbon and oxygen) and may reduce oxygen levels in the water to a point where aquatic life cannot survive. The habitat destruction associated with rapid sedimentation severely impairs the ability of coastal environments to support commercially important finfish and shellfish populations. Migratory waterfowl also utilize nearshore plant and shellfish communities as a food source during their annual migration. The reduction of waterfowl in recent years has been associated, in part, with habitat destruction from sedimentation derived from development activity. Erosion and subsequent sedimentation of waterways also impairs recreational areas. The aesthetics and the attraction of many streams, lakes and reservoirs used for swimming, boating, fishing and other water-related recreational activities maybe destroyed from excessive erosion and the resultant sedimentation. Factors that Influence Soil Erosion  When designing a development plan, the inherent erodibility of the proposed development site must he evaluated. The erosion potential of any area is determined by four principal factors: the erodibility of soil, vegetative cover, topography, and climate. Although the factors are interrelated as determinants of erosion potential, they are discussed separately for ease of understanding. 17   Soil Erodibility The vulnerability of a soil to erosion is known as erodibility. Soil erodibility is influenced by average particle size and gradation (texture), percentage of organic matter, and soil structure. The most erodible soils generally contain high proportions of silt and very fine sand. The presence of clay or organic matter tends to decrease soil erodibility. Clays are sticky and tend to bind soil particles together, which along with organic matter helps to maintain stable soil structure (aggregates). Vegetative Cover There are several ways in which vegetation protects soil from the erosive forces of raindrop impact and runoff scour. Vegetation (top growth) shields the soil surface from raindrop impact while the root mass holds soil particles in place. Vegetation also can ""filter"" sediment from runoff. Thus grass ""buffer strips"" can be used to remove sediment from the surface runoff. Vegetation also slows the velocity of runoff and helps maintain the infiltration capacity of a soil. Maintenance and establishment of vegetation is the most important factor in combating erosion. The goal is to expose as small an area as possible for the shortest length of time. By minimizing the time and extent of soil exposure, the erosion hazard is also minimized. Topography Slope length and steepness are key influences on both the volume and velocity of surface runoff. Longer slopes deliver more runoff to the base of slopes and steeper slopes increase runoff velocity; both conditions enhance the potential for erosion to occur. Climate Erosion potential is also affected by the climate of an area. Rainfall characteristics (e.g. frequency, intensity, and duration) directly influence the amount of runoff that is generated. As the frequency of rainfall increases, water has less chance between storms to drain through the soil. The soil will remain 18   saturated for longer periods of time and stormwater runoff volume will be greater. Therefore, where rainfall events are frequent, intense, or lengthy, erosion risks are high. Seasonal variation in temperature and rainfall defines periods of high erosion potential during the year. Snow will not cause erosion as it falls, but when rapid melts occur, erosion may result. Soil Loss Rates Raindrop size, intensity of rainstorms, and amount of rainfall affect soil loss rates. Note that May through September is the period of the year when high soil loss rates are most likely to occur in Maryland. Soil erosion and sedimentation can occur when soil, vegetative, topographic, and climatic factors are not considered during the planning stage of development. Areas slated for development that are deemed environmentally sensitive (e.g., those with high soil erosion potential and/or proximity to surface water) demand added attention to proposed clearing and grading activity, soil erosion and sediment control requirements and final site stabilization. (Aside from concern for potential sediment erosion, other environmental concerns exist when a site is being planned for development. These include:    Extensive denudation exposes underlying soils to rain and runoff. Exposure of underlying soil or geologic formations that are less pervious and/or more erodible than original soil surface. Prolonged exposure of unprotected and disturbed soils due to scheduling problems and/or delayed construction (phasing problems) may cause additional erosion.  The placement of impervious surfaces will reduce rain infiltration and groundwater recharge. This may affect slope stability and survival of existing and/or newly established vegetation. Creation of exposures facing south and west may hinder plant growth due to adverse temperature and moisture conditions; and Exposure of subsurface soils that are rocky, acidic, draughty, or poorly draining may hinder vegetative establishment.  19   Stormwater Runoff Whenever the land use of a watershed changes, the runoff characteristics will also change. Going from a forest to a developed condition will increase the amount of runoff coming from the land. The increase in runoff volumes is the result of reduced capacity of exposed soils to absorb rainfall due to compaction caused by heavy equipment. Grading operations and the placement of structures (streets, building, etc.) may enlarge existing drainage areas or concentrate surface flows with resultant increases in runoff volume and velocity. Increased impervious surfaces associated with the construction of streets, building, sidewalks, and paved driveways and parking lots will increase stormwater discharge by reducing on-site infiltration of rain.  Basic Principles of Soil Erosion and Sediment Control 1) PLAN THE DEVELOPMENT TO FIT THE SITE Areas of high erosion potential should be left undisturbed whenever possible. Specific characteristics that could limit a site's development potential include highly erodible or acid soils, temperature extremes that inhibit vegetative stabilization, steep slopes and proximity to surface waters. For instance, some areas, such as floodplains and wetlands, should not be developed at all. Floodplains are nearly level areas adjacent to stream channels that temporarily store excess runoff. Functioning in this way, floodplains help avoid erosion and flooding in downstream areas. Ideally, these areas should be preserved in their natural state as open space or recreational areas.  20   2) EXPOSE THE SMALLEST PRACTICAL AREA OF LAND FOR THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME When soil disturbances occur and the natural vegetation is r emoved, the extent and duration of exposure should be minimized. Plan the phases or stages of development so that only the areas which are actively being developed are exposed. All other areas should have a good cover of temporary or permanent vegetation or mulch. Grading should he completed as soon as possible after it is initiated. As cut slopes are made, and as fill slopes are brought up to grade, these areas should be revegetated as the work progresses. This is known as staged seeding. 3) APPLY EROSION CONTROL AS A FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST ONSITE DAMAGE Implementing practices that prevent or minimize erosion on a construction site is called ""erosion control"". ""Erosion control"" strategies attempt to prevent or minimize the problem of erosion on developing sites. The following guidelines apply to ""erosion control"" strategies:  Clear only what is required for construction; where possible, large projects should be cleared and graded as construction progresses; mass clearing and grading should be avoided; Reestablish with vegetation as-soon-as possible after construction is completed; certain sections of large construction projects may be completed before others and be ready for stabilization before the total project is completed; waiting until the end of the project to commence all site stabilization may leave areas exposed for unnecessarily long durations; Areas that have been cleared and graded, but will not be constructed on for more than 14 days (7 days for steep slopes) must be stabilized with mulch or temporary vegetation; Extraneous runoff should be diverted from critical areas such as highly erodible soils and steep slopes and conveyed to stable areas; and The formation of large drainage areas and the concentrating of surface runoff flow patterns should be avoided where possible. 21           4) USE SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES AS PERIMETER PROTECTION TO PREVENT OFF-SITE DAMAGE Controls placed along the perimeter of the site to collect eroded sediments must be implemented. Diversion ditches, sediment traps, (see the Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control) vegetative filters and sediment basins are examples of practices to control sediment. These sediment controls should be in place before clearing and grading operations begin. Generally, sediment can be retained by two methods: (a) filtering runoff as it flows through a vegetated area and (b) impounding the sediment laden runoff for a period of time so that the soil particles settle out. The best way to control sediment, however, it to prevent erosion as discussed in the third principle. 5) IMPLEMENT A THOROUGH MAINTENANCE AND FOLLOW-UP OPERATION. This principle is vital to the success of the four other principles. A site must have thorough periodic maintenance checks of soil erosion and sediment control practices. Control practices must he maintained just as construction equipment must be maintained. An example of applying this principle would be to start a routine ""end of day check"" to make sure that all control practices are working properly. Also, all controls should be inspected for needed maintenance after rainfall events.  Developing the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan The basic principles of soil erosion and sediment control should be consider ed in conjunction with the environmental concerns for the proposed development site when formulating the Grading and Sediment Control Plan. 1) PLANNING PROCEDURES Determine limits of clearing and grading. Decide exactly which areas must he disturbed in order to accommodate the proposed construction. Pay special attention to critical areas which must be disturbed. Staged clearing and grading (as an alternative to massive clearing and grading) should be considered where feasible.  22   Divide the site int o natural drainage areas. Determine how runoff will travel over the site. Consider how soil erosion and sedimentation can be controlled in each small drainage area before looking at the entire site. Remember, it is advantageous to control soil erosion (prevent the problem) rather than retrofit perimeter controls to collect the end result of the problem (sediment). Maximum drainage areas to sediment controls must be clearly delineated. Select soil erosion and sediment control practices. Soil erosion and sediment control practices can be divided into 3 categories: vegetative controls, (see the Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control) structural controls, and site management. This handbook should be used for the selection and design of vegetative and structural practices. Management measures are construction management techniques and decisions which, if made with consideration of the potential erosion problems on a site, can minimize the need for designed controls. Vegetative Con trols - The first line of defense against off-site sediment damage is to prevent soil erosion. This is accomplished by protecting the soil surface from raindrop impact and overland flow of runoff. The best way to protect the soil surface is to preserve the existing vegetative groundcover. Where land disturbance is necessary, temporary seeding or mulching must be used on areas which will be exposed for longer than 14 days (7 days for steep slopes). Permanent stabilization should be performed as soon as possible after the graded area is completed. Soil erosion and sediment control plans must contain provisions for permanent stabilization of disturbed areas. Soil type, soil amendments, seedbed preparation, and mulching, should be described on the plans. Selection of permanent vegetation should include the following considerations: a. b. c. d. establishment requirements; adaptability to site conditions; aesthetic and natural resource values; and maintenance requirements.  Structural controls - Structural practices are usually required since not all disturbed areas can be promptly protected with vegetation. They are often used as a second or third line of defense to capture sediment before it leaves the site. It is very important that structural practices be selected to provide the optimum  23   sediment control strategy and be designed and constructed according to the standards and specifications. Management Measures - Good construction management is as important as physical practices for soil erosion and sediment control, and there is generally little or no cost involved. The following are some management considerations which can be employed: a. Sequence construction so that no area remains exposed for more than 14 days (7 days for steep slopes) without stabilization. b. Temporary or permanent seeding should be done immediately after grading. c. On large projects, stage the construction so that one area can be stabilized before another is disturbed. d. Develop and carry out a regular maintenance schedule for soil erosion and sediment control practices. e. Physically mark off limits of land disturbance on the site with tape, signs or other methods, so the workers can see areas to be protected. f. Make sure that all workers understand the major provisions of the soil erosion and sediment control plan. g. Responsibility should be designated to one individual (Responsible Personnel) who has been certified in soil erosion and sediment control. 2) SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN CONTENT The soil er osion and sediment control strategy that is formulated by development planners is conveyed to the contractors through the soil erosion and sediment control plan. All plans must be easy to read and interpret if they are to be implemented correctly. To help clarify and simplify the plans, standard symbols and uniform scales have been developed. Standard symbols are used to facilitate the understanding and review of plans. They should be bold and easily discernible on the plans. 24   3) SCALE The following scales are recommended for use on soil erosion and sediment control plans because they facilitate the plan review process: 1"" = 20', 1"" = 30', 1"" = 40', 1"" = 50'. Minimum scale will be established by the plan review agency. The contour interval for these plans shall be two feet or less. Other scales or contour intervals may be favored for special types of land disturbance projects. For example, strip mine plans are often drawn to scales of 1"" = 200' or 1"" = 500' with contour intervals of 5 to 20 feet. Consult the appropriate plan review agency prior to finalizing the selection of plan scale.

Land Clearing Debris One of the many items that must be addressed by the soil erosion and sediment control plan, discussed in the previous section, is land clearing debris. Land clearing operations prior to the construction of new homes and communities often result in the production of land clearing debris (LCD). LCD includes earthen materials such as clay, sand, gravel, silt, and rock. In addition, LCD includes natural wood waste materials such as tree stumps, root mats, brush and limbs, and logs. All of the above materials need to be recycled, reused or properly disposed to prevent them from adversely affecting the environment. As reported to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) in 1999, over 150,000 tons of LCD was accepted at permitted disposal facilities in Maryland. This number represents only a small amount of LCD that was actually generated. While LCD is comprised of naturally occurring materials it is no less a threat to the health of Maryland's environment. Handled improperly, the clays, sands, gravels and silts from LCD may wash off into Maryland's streams, rivers and lakes causing harm to the various aquatic organisms. The tree stumps, root mats, logs and brush, if left unburied or improperly buried are unsightly, may be a fire hazard and may provide shelter for animals of concern to the homeowner, including snakes and rats. In addition, buried LCD can adversely affect groundwater and surface water due to the release of chemicals associated with decomposition. There are many things that can be done to prevent LCD from causing pollution. The institution of sediment control measures during construction activities as discussed in Runoff Section is an important first step. Minimizing the area that is disturbed during construction activities reduces the amount of LCD generated in the first place. Often, the homebuilder or developer will grind the trees and stumps etc. onsite and utilize the existing material as mulch or a soil amendment around the homesite. Many counties in Maryland provide the option of composting LCD and grass clippings at the landfill. For example, Montgomery County with the help of the Maryland Environmental Service, composts approximately 70,000 tons of leaves and grass clippings per year and produces a product called ""Leafgro"" that is used by nurseries and landscapers. Several private businesses convert wood waste materials 26   into mulch for sale to citizens, landscapers and nurseries. This reuse of LCD saves valuable landfill space and helps to reduce the need for the construction of new landfills. The Maryland Department of the Environment is the lead agency regulating the handling and disposal of LCD. LCD can be placed in permitted LCD landfills that are required to meet minimum operating requirements as stipulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D, 40 CFR parts 257 and 258, Maryland Environment Article Title 9 Subtitle 2, and COMAR Title 26 Subtitle 4. Natural Woodwaste recycling is regulated under Environment Article Title 9 Subtitles 1701 and 1708. In addition, there are sediment and erosion control requirements that must be followed during land clearing and construction activities. Many county governments also have regulatory programs that oversee these types of activities. Sources: Fact Sheet  Maryland's Natural Wood Waste Recycling Facility Program  1. Construction and Demolition Debris According to the Maryland Office of Planning, Maryland's population in 1999 was approximately 5.2 million people. It is projected that Maryland's population will grow by 1 million people over the next 20 years. All these people will either need to construct new homes or renovate existing structures. This building and renovation will create what MDE classifies as Construction/Demolition Debris (C&D). C&D includes structural building materials such as lumber, drywall, insulation, cement, pipe, wire, asphalt, tile and many other materials that are used to build homes. According to information submitted to MDE approximately 4.2 million tons of C&D debris was generated in Maryland in 1999. Only about half of this material was recycled while the remainder was disposed of at permitted land disposal facilities. In an effort to avoid transportation and landfill costs, C&D material is sometimes buried or burned near the home site. Both of these activities are prohibited by Maryland's environmental laws and regulations. Disposed of improperly C&D material may allow man-made chemicals to leach into groundwater and surface water. Large concentrations of drywall, when buried 27   may allow for the production of hydrogen sulfide (rotten eggs) gas. materials that constitute C&D material can be recycled or reused.  Many of the  Promoting the recycling and reuse of C&D material may prevent pollution. Encouraging the use of ""Green"" construction materials and Green building methods are recommended. Green construction materials are those products that are made from recycled materials. For example, some lumber is mow produced from recycled plastic. Green buildings is a concept that promotes the development of sites in a manner that promotes the efficient use of raw materials, protects the environment and provides for community and cultural sensitivity. Recycling other material and creating new products will help to preserve our natural resources and protect the environment. The Maryland Department of the Environment, is the lead agency that regulates the disposal of C&D material in Maryland. MDE with the assistance of sister agencies and local governments promotes the recycling of C&D material. C&D material can only be disposed of in permitted landfills that are required to meet minimum operating requirements as stipulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D, 40 CFR parts 257 and 258, Maryland Environment Article Title 9 Subtitle 2, and COMAR Title 26 Subtitle 4.

Stormwater Management Why Stormwater Matters: Impact of Runoff on Maryland's Watersheds Urban development has a profound influence on the quality of Maryland's waters. To start, development dramatically alters the local hydrologic cycle (see Figure 1.1). The hydrology of a site changes during the initial clearing and grading that occurs during construction. Trees, meadow grasses, and agricultural crops that had intercepted and absorbed rainfall are removed and natural depressions that had temporarily ponded water are graded to a uniform slope. Cleared and graded sites are subject to erosion. These sites are often severely compacted and can no longer prevent rainfall from being rapidly converted into stormwater runoff. Figure 1.1 Water Balance at a Developed and Undeveloped Site (Source: Schueler, 1987)  Surface runoff is minimal in an undeveloped site, but dominates the water balance at a highly impervious site.  29   The situation worsens after construction. Roof tops, roads, parking lots, driveways and other impervious surfaces do not allow rainfall to soak into the ground. Consequently, most rainfall is converted directly to stormwater runoff. This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 1.2, which shows the increase in the volumetric runoff coefficient (R v ) as a function of site imperviousness. The runoff coefficient expresses the fraction of rainfall volume that is converted into stormwater runoff. As can be seen, the volume of stormwater runoff increases sharply with impervious cover. For example, a one acre parking lot can produce 16 times more stormwater runoff than a one acre meadow each year (Schueler, 1994). The increase in stormwater runoff can be too much for the existing natural drainage system to handle. As a result, the natural drainage system must be ""improved"" to rapidly collect runoff and quickly convey it away (using curb and gutter, enclosed storm sewers, and lined channels). The stormwater runoff is subsequently discharged to downstream waters such as streams, reservoirs, lakes or estuaries. Figure 1.2 Relationship between Impervious Cover and the Volumetric Runoff Coefficient (Source: Schueler, 1987)  The runoff coefficient (R v ) expresses the fraction of rainfall that is converted into runoff. The data points reflect over 35 monitoring stations in the U.S. 30   Declining Water Quality Impervious surfaces accumulate pollutants deposited from the atmosphere, leaked from vehicles, or windblown from adjacent areas. During storm events, these pollutants quickly wash off and are rapidly delivered to downstream waters. Some common pollutants found in urban stormwater runoff are profiled in Table 1.1 and include: Nutrients. Urban runoff has elevated concentrations of both phosphorus and nitrogen, which can enrich streams, lakes, reservoirs and estuaries (known as eutrophication). In particular, excess nutrients have been documented to be a major factor in the decline of the Chesapeake Bay. Excess nutrients promote algal growth that blocks sunlight from reaching underwater grasses and depletes oxygen in bottom waters. Urban runoff has been identified as a key and controllable source of non-point source pollution. Maryland has committed to reducing tributary nutrient loadings by 40% as part of the Chesapeake Bay restoration effort. Suspended solids. Sources of sediment include washoff of particles that are deposited on impervious surfaces and the erosion of streambanks and construction sites. Both suspended and deposited sediments can have adverse effects on aquatic life in streams, lakes and estuaries. Sediments also transport other attached pollutants. Organic Carbon. Organic matter, washed from impervious surfaces during storms, can present a problem in slower moving downstream waters. As organic matter decomposes, it can deplete dissolved oxygen in lakes and tidal waters. Low levels of oxygen in the water can have an adverse impact on aquatic life. Bacteria. Bacteria levels in stormwater runoff routinely exceed public health standards for water contact recreation. Bacteria associated with stormwater runoff can also lead to the closure of adjacent shellfish beds and swimming beaches and may increase the cost of treating drinking water at water supply reservoirs. Hydrocarbons. Vehicles leak oil and grease which contain a wide array of hydrocarbon compounds, at low concentrations to aquatic life. Trace Metals. Cadmium, copper, lead and zinc are routinely found in stormwater runoff. These metals can be toxic to aquatic life at certain concentrations and can also accumulate in the sediments of streams, lakes and the Chesapeake Bay. 31   Pesticides. A modest number of currently used and recently banned insecticides and herbicides have been detected in urban streamflow at concentrations that approach or exceed toxicity thresholds for aquatic life. Chlorides. Salts that are applied to roads and parking lots in the winter months appear in stormwater runoff and meltwater at much higher concentrations than many freshwater organisms can tolerate. Thermal Impacts. Impervious surfaces may increase temperature in receiving waters, such as asphalt parking lots which absorb sunlight and product heat adversely impacting aquatic life that requires cold and cool water conditions (e.g., trout). Trash and Debris. Considerable quantities of trash and debris are washed through storm drain networks. The trash and debris accumulate in streams and lakes, and carrying pollutants, detract from their natural beauty.

The amount of rainfall that recharges groundwater varies, depending on the slope, soil, and vegetation. Some indication of the importance of recharge is shown in Table 1.2 which shows Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) regional estimates of average annual recharge volume based on soil type. Table 1.2 NRCS Estimates of Annual Recharge Rates, Based on Soil Type (Local Soil Conservation Districts have Soil Map Books that identify USDA Soil location, classification, etc). Hydrologic Soil Group (NRCS) ""A"" Soils ""B"" Soils ""C"" Soils ""D"" Soils Average Annual Recharge Volume 18 inches/year 12 inches/year 6 inches/year 3 inches/year  Average annual rainfall is about 40 inches per year across Maryland.  Groundwater is a critical water resource across the State. Not only do many residents depend on groundwater for their drinking water, but the health of many aquatic systems is also dependent on its steady discharge. For example, during periods of dry weather, groundwater sustains flows in streams and helps to maintain the hydrology of non-tidal wetlands (Figure 1.3). Because development creates impervious surfaces that prevent natural recharge, a net decrease in groundwater recharge rates can be expected in urban watersheds. Thus, during prolonged periods of dry weather, stream flow sharply diminishes. In smaller headwater streams, the decline in stream flow can cause a perennial stream to become seasonally dry.  33   Figure 1.3 Decline in Stream Flow Due to Diminished Groundwater Recharge  After development, stream flow declines during extended periods of dry weather because of the diminished recharge of groundwater. Urban land uses and activities can also degrade groundwater quality if stormwater runoff is directed into the soil without adequate treatment. Certain land uses and activities (e.g. industrial activities, maintenance yards, etc.) are known to produce higher loads of metals and toxic chemicals and are designated as stormwater hotspots. Soluble pollutants, such as chloride, nitrate, copper, dissolved solids and some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) can migrate into groundwater and potentially contaminate wells. Stormwater runoff should never be infiltrated into the soil if a site is a designated hotspot.  34   Degradation of Stream Channels Stormwater runoff is a powerful force that influences the geometry of streams. After development, both the frequency and magnitude of storm flows increase dramatically. Consequently, urban stream channels experience more bankfull and sub-bankfull flow events each year than they had prior to development. (See Increased Overbank Flooding for definition 2 pages after this) Figure 1.4 Increased Frequency of the Flows Greater Than the Critical Discharge Rate in a Stream Channel after Development  Development greatly increases the frequency that a stream exceeds the critical discharge rate that corresponds to the onset of channel erosion and enlargement.  35   As a result, the stream bed and banks are exposed to highly erosive flows more frequently and for longer periods. Streams typically respond to this change by increasing cross-sectional area to handle the more frequent and erosive flows either by channel widening or down cutting, or both. This results in a highly unstable phase where the stream experiences severe bank erosion and habitat degradation. In this phase, the stream often experiences some of the following changes:    rapid stream widening increased streambank and channel erosion decline in stream substrate quality (through sediment deposition and embedding of the substrate) loss of pool/riffle structure in the stream channel degradation of stream habitat structure     The decline in the physical habitat of the stream, coupled with lower base flows and higher stormwater pollutant loads, has a severe impact on the aquatic community. Recent research has shown the following changes in stream ecology:    decline in aquatic insect and freshwater mussel diversity decline in fish diversity degradation of aquatic habitat  Traditionally, Maryland has attempted to provide some measure of channel protection by imposing the two-year storm peak discharge control requirement, which requires that the discharge from the two-year post development peak rates be reduced to pre development levels. However, recent research and experience indicate that the two-year peak discharge criterion is not capable of protecting downstream channels from erosion. In some cases, controlling the two year storm may actually accelerate streambank erosion because it exposes the channel to a longer duration of erosive flows than it would have otherwise received.  36   Increased Overbank Flooding Flow events that exceed the capacity of the stream channel spill out into adjacent floodplains. These are termed "" overbank"" floods and can damage property and downstream drainage structures. While some overbank flooding is inevitable and even desirable, the historical goal of drainage design in most of Maryland has been to maintain pre-development peak discharge rates for both the two and ten-year frequency storms after development, thus keeping the level of overbank flooding the same over time. This prevents costly damage or maintenance for culverts, drainage structures, and swales. Overbank floods are ranked in terms of their statistical return frequency. For example, a flood that has a 50% chance of occurring in any given year is termed a ""two year"" flood. The two-year storm is also known as the ""bankfull flood,"" as researchers have demonstrated that most natural stream channels in the State have just enough capacity to handle the two-year flood before spilling into the floodplain. In Maryland, about 3.0 to 3.5 inches of rain in a 24-hour period produces a two-year or bankfull flood. This rainfall depth is termed the two-year design storm. Similarly, a flood that has a 10% chance of occurring in any given year is termed a ""ten-year flood."" A ten-year flood occurs when a storm event produces about 4.5 to 5.5 inches of rain in a 24 hour period. Under traditional engineering practice, most channels and storm drains in Maryland are designed with enough capacity to safely pass the peak discharge from the ten-year design storm. Urban given design and drainage development Figure 1.5. development increases the peak discharge rate associated with a storm because impervious surfaces generate greater runoff volumes systems deliver it more rapidly to a stream. The change in post peak discharge rates that accompany development is profiled in  37   Figure 1.5 Change in Hydrograph following Development (Source: Schueler, 1987)  The impervious surfaces and conveyance systems of developed sites result in an earlier and higher peak discharge rate.  38   Floodplain Expansion The level areas bordering streams and rivers are known as floodplains. Operationally, the floodplain is usually defined as the land area within the limits of the 100-year storm flow water elevation. The 100-year storm has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year and typically serves as the basis for controlling development in the State and establishing insurance rates by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In Maryland, a 100-year flood occurs after about 7 to 8 inches of rainfall in a 24 hour period (e.g., the 100-year storm). These floods can be very destructive and can pose a threat to property and human life. Floodplains are natural flood storage areas and help to attenuate downstream flooding. Floodplains are very important habitat areas, encompassing riparian forests, wetlands, and wildlife corridors. Consequently, all local jurisdictions in Maryland restrict or even prohibit new development within the 100year floodplain to prevent flood hazards and conserve habitats. Nevertheless, prior development that has occurred in the floodplain remains subject to periodic flooding during these storms. As with overbank floods, development sharply increases the peak discharge rate associated with the 100-year design storm. As a consequence, the elevation of a stream's 100 year floodplain becomes higher and the boundaries of its floodplain expand (see Figure 1.6). In some instances, property and structures that had not previously been subject to flooding are now at risk. Additionally, such a shift in a floodplain's hydrology can degrade wetlands and forest habitats.  39   Figure 1.6 Change in Floodplain Elevations (Source: Schueler, 1987)  Both the elevation and the lateral boundaries of the 100-year floodplain increase when development occurs upstream. General Performance Standards for Stormwater Management in Maryland To prevent adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the State of Maryland has developed twelve performance standards that must be met at development sites. These standards apply to any construction activity disturbing 5,000 or more square feet of earth. The following development activities are exempt from these performance standards in Maryland: 1. 2. 3. Agricultural land management activities, Additions or modifications to existing single family structures, and Developments that do not disturb more than 5000 square feet of land.  40   The following performance standards shall be addressed at all sites where stormwater management is required: Standard No. 1 Site designs shall minimize the generation of stormwater and utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment. Stormwater runoff generated from development discharged directly into a jurisdictional wetland or waters of the State of Maryland shall be adequately treated. Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained by promoting infiltration through the use of structural and nonstructural methods. At a minimum, annual recharge from the post development site shall mimic the annual recharge from pre development site conditions. For new development, structural Best Management Practices (BMPs) shall be designed to remove 80% of the average annual post development total suspended solids load (TSS). It is presumed that a BMP complies with this performance standard if it is:     sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQv ), designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in this manual, constructed properly, and maintained regularly.  Standard No. 2  Standard No. 3  Standard No. 4  41   Standard No. 5  On the Eastern Shore, the post development peak discharge rate shall not exceed the pre development peak discharge rate for the two-year frequency storm event. Elsewhere in Maryland, local authorities may require that the post development ten-year peak discharge not exceed the pre- development peak discharge if the channel protection storage volume (Cpv ) is provided (see Standard No. 6). In addition, safe conveyance for the 100-year storm event shall be provided. To protect stream channels from degradation, Cpv shall be provided by 12 to 24 hours of extended detention storage for the one year storm event. Cpv shall not be provided on the Eastern Shore unless the appropriate approval authority determines it is necessary on a case by case determination. Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (e.g., cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas, water supply reservoirs, Chesapeake Bay Critical Area) may be subject to additional performance criteria or may need to utilize or restrict certain BMPs. All BMPs shall have an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed. Every BMP shall have an acceptable form of water quality pretreatment. Redevelopment, defined as any construction, alteration or improvement exceeding 5000 square feet in areas where existing land use is high density commercial, industrial, institutional or multi-family residential, is governed by special stormwater sizing criteria depending on the amount of increase or decrease in impervious area created by the redevelopment. Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan and file a notice of intent (NOI) under the provisions of Maryland's Stormwater Industrial National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit (a list of industrial categories subject to the pollution prevention requirement can be found in Appendix D-6). (included in volume II of the Manual reference web page 42  Standard No. 6  Standard No. 7  Standard No. 8  Standard No. 9  Standard No. 10  Standard No. 11   http://www.mde.state.md.us) The requirements for preparing and implementing a stormwater pollution prevention plan are described in the general discharge permit (included in volume II of the Manual reference web page http://www.mde.state.md.us) available from MDE and guidance can be found in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) document entitled, ""Storm Water Management for Industrial Activities, Developing Pollution Prevention Plans and Best Management Practices."" The stormwater pollution prevention plan requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites. Standard No. 12 Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential for pollutant loadings, defined as hotspots in Chapter 2, may require the use of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices. In addition, stormwater from a hotspot land use may not be infiltrated. In Maryland, local governments are usually responsible for most stormwater management review authority. Therefore, prior to design, applicants should always consult with their local reviewing agency to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements. In addition, certain earth disturbances may require NPDES construction general permit coverage with MDE (see Appendix D-7)(included in Volume II of the Manual reference web page http://www.mde.state.md.us)  Standard No. 13  Source: Chapter One the ""2000 Maryland Stormwater Design Manual"" available on MDE Web Page: http://www.mde.state.md.us  43   D. Septic Systems The principle purpose of septic systems is to provide primary removal of solids prior to disposal through soil absorption systems. Historically, the key objective was to locate and design systems to protect groundwater and on-site drinking water wells from bacteriological contamination. Some soils function as an excellent filtering material for pathogenic bacteria, which are typically removed within several feet of the soil absorption systems (tile fields, seepage pits, deep trenches, etc.) unless or carbonate geologic formations are encountered. Unlike bacteria, dissolved nitrates, nitrites, and other forms of nitrogen are not bound up in soils and are able to penetrate groundwater and ultimately reach wells, surface waterways and rivers. This can result in nitrate groundwater contamination where concentrated areas with septic systems have been used. This is especially disconcerting in areas where on-site drinking water wells are drawing water from unconfined aquifers (see SupplyWell Problems - Changes in Water Quality, Basic-Ground-Water Hydrology page 78 at end of Septic System section) , which are at greatest risk for this type of contamination. Nitrate levels in drinking water exceeding 10 mg/l pose a significant public health risk to infants and children under two years of age, as this population is vulnerable to ""blue baby syndrome"" ( methemoglobinemia) (See Facts About at end of Septic Systems Section). The EPA/State Chesapeake Bay Program reports that approximately 6% of the nitrogen reaching the Bay originates from septic systems. More importantly, the Maryland Tributary Strategy Teams have reported that where local watersheds are being impaired by nitrogen, 3% to 19% of that nitrogen is attributable to septic systems (Tributary Teams Annual Report, DNR, 1998). As rural areas beyond the Baltimore and Washington suburbs, where community water and sewer infrastructure is not available, continue to be subject to growth pressure, there is a great concern that the total loading of nitrogen to ground and surface water will increase. Without properly controlling this source of nitrogen, pollution from septic systems will increase, both as a total load and as a percentage of all sources. Over 400,000 Maryland residences and businesses are served by on-site sewage disposal systems (OSDS)  most of them are still using technologies that were introduced over 50 years ago. 44   In Maryland, a conventional OSDS typically consists of a container (tank), with an inlet, an outlet, a pumping port and several internal baffles. The outlet drains partially clarified liquids to a ""drain field,"" a network of pipes which distributes the wastewater to a soil, sand, or gravel media for absorption, distribution and removal. The septic tank removes solids by holding the wastewater in the tank, allowing solids time to settle to the bottom and scum (greases, fats and other lightweight materials) to float to the top. The septic tank provides primary settling and partial digestion of organic matter. Baffles help to prevent wastewater from moving through the tank too quickly and force wastewater to enter and exit below the scum layer. The goal of the drain field, with soil, sand, or gravel absorption areas (used in both conventional (septic tank and gravity trenches or seepage pits) and non-conventional systems) is the hydraulic disposal of the effluent to the ground (i.e. groundwater) and/or the maximum treatment and attenuation of the effluent by the soil (through processes of physical filtration, biologic competition, ion exchange, and absorption) before it reaches the groundwater. It is estimated that as much as 80 to 100 percent of the nitrogen in septic tank effluent may reach groundwater. Many older systems were installed before the establishment of soil treatment zone requirements and may have little to no unsaturated soil for treatment beneath the trench. For most of the State, Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) specifies a four-foot thick unsaturated soil treatment zone. COMAR permits counties in Maryland's coastal plain to designate areas where less than a four-foot unsaturated treatment zone may be allowed, provided existing or potential underground drinking water resources are not affected. This shallow groundwater typically discharges directly into the local waterway. When deep trench filtration fields are used there is virtually no nitrogen uptake, and the nitrogen goes straight into the groundwater.

While the installation on individual septics with treatment units will add $3,000 to $10,000 to the cost of each property to be absorbed by the buyer, they represent no costs to the community if properly cared for. Maintenance costs of approximately $200 per year will allow these systems to perform adequately over an indefinite period of time. Statutes/regulations The Annotated Code of Maryland, Environment Article, Section 9-216, 9-223, 9-252, 10-103, 10-301 and 10-304 is the enabling legislation for controlling septic system installations through criteria and regulation. Title 26, Subtitle 04, Chapter 02, Sewage Disposal and Certain Water Systems for Homes and Other Establishments in the Counties of Maryland Where a Public Sewage System is Not Available. This regulation deals with loading rates and system design for individual on-site sewage disposal systems. There are no requirements in Maryland for reducing nitrogen levels. Legislation introduced by the Governor during the 2000 Legislative Session was defeated. There are no federal laws or regulations limiting nitrogen outputs from systems. Several States  Washington, Minnesota, Massachusetts have instituted some programs.

Both surface and groundwater are subject to contamination, but there is an important distinction. Contamination in surface water may be transient, lasting only a few days or weeks. Conversely, contamination in groundwater may persist for decades or centuries. There are many sources of well contamination. Understanding the risks of contamination and locating wells far enough from potential sources of contamination can not only provide a safe, reliable supply of drinking water, but also reduce the cost of treatment. Proper well construction is also a prerequisite to protecting the water supply (well diagrams). After wells have been developed testing for potential contaminants should be completed. In the State of Maryland a Certificate of Potability is mandated by Code of Maryland Regulations before a well can be put into service. The parameters for routine testing include coliform bacteria, sand particles, turbidity and nitrates. The chemical compounds associated with pesticides or organic solvents are not required to be routinely analyzed when putting the well into service. If there is some reason to suspect contamination (i.e. residential development on a former intensive agricultural operation), these tests are run. As stated, individual wells are subject to contamination from microorganisms, and chemicals if not properly constructed and sited. The primary source of contamination is from either on-site or immediately adjacent sewage disposal systems (refer to septic system discussion). The primary contaminant of concern is nitrate, which has a standard of 10 mg/l for drinking water. If contamination does occur, filters, which can be installed for the entire house system or on individual faucets at the point of use are available from most commercial water treatment equipment manufacturers to remove this contaminant.  50   Animal feces, toxic chemicals from plastics, solvents, pesticides, paints, dyes, lawn care products, and other products which leach heavy metals are other examples of potential contaminants. Salt, detergents and solvents can dissolve and reach with groundwater and migrate great distances with it. For these reasons compounds of these types should be stored in proper containers and used with caution around the home and on the property. Economic Impact Contamination of drinking water supplies represents a significant public health issue which goes beyond economic considerations. In addition, several economic impacts can be imposed on communities to extend community water systems to take care of problems created by the improper disposal of chemicals by homeowners. Entire aquifers are at risk by the indiscriminate use of toxic materials by even a single homeowner. The entire community must then absorb the millions of dollars in cost to create or extend a municipal treatment system.

Green Buildings Green Building can be defined as the design and construction of buildings and the development of sites in a manner that makes efficient use of raw materials and natural resources, protects the environment and promotes sustainable communities. Green Building is not a particular style, technique or practice. According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, it is a philosophy of building on land that fosters environmental responsiveness, resource efficiency, and community and cultural sensitivity. The mission of Maryland's Green Building program is to facilitate change in the way development occurs throughout the State by increasing the awareness and use of environmentally responsible building practices, materials and site designs that provide comfortable, affordable and healthier buildings.  Sustainable Buildings - involves resource conserving. Examples passive-solar and other energy energy efficient applicants and making buildings more energy efficient and include using recycled materials, incorporating efficient architectural designs, and installing water efficient plumbing fixtures.    Site Development - involves promoting the design and development of land in an environmentally-sensitive manner , Principles include minimizing the loss of native vegetation, designing landscapes consistent with natural contours, and preserving the land's natural hydrologic regime. Local Government Planning - involves achieving environmentally responsible buildings and site designs by assisting local goverments to generate codes, ordinances and development policies that minimize environmental impact and reduce imperviousness.    The ideal green building or development has yet to be developed, and if one were, the definition of ""ideal"" would be up for discussion. What is important is that more and more consumers and development professionals are thinking about sustainability and are incorporating green principles and techniques into what they do. In short, green building is about striving for sustainability.

Energy Conservation Energy conservation in buildings includes everything that separates the interior of a building from the outdoor environment, including the windows, walls, foundation, basement slab, ceiling, roof, and insulation. Conserving energy saves money, reduces environmental pollution and improves the quality of the Chesapeake Bay. Energy efficient appliances - look for energy ratings on refrigerators, freezers, washers, dryers, and hot water heaters. Be aware of technological advances in residential heating and cooling systems. Consider renewable energy sources such as solar and geothermal, if they are feasible for your situation. In addition, set back your thermostat, insulate the attics, floors, etc., and weather-strip windows and doors. Turn off all appliances, including radios, TVs, and lights when you are going to be out of the room for awhile. Space Heating and Cooling Energy-efficient heating and cooling of buildings are aided through the use of automated controls, ventilation, improved duct systems, and advanced technologies. Water Heating Energy-efficient water heating combined with water-efficient appliances and fixtures will save water, energy, and money. Your energy bill will benefit substantially from putting an insulation jacket on your water heater. Lighting is a big part of your energy budget. Compact Fluorescent bulbs are more energy efficient than incandescent lamps--four times as much, and last ten times longer. Light task areas (workbench, sewing table, etc.) so you won't have to light up the whole room. Check bulb wattage and consider energy efficient light bulbs.

Water Conservation The average home can reduce inside water use by approximately 30% taking measures to conserve water usage, minimize leaks and installing water efficient fixtures and applications. Efficient water use helps to reduce the need for costly water supply and wastewater treatment facilities, helps maintain stream flows and healthy aquatic habitats, and reduces the energy used to pump, heat and treat water.

HOUSEHOLD CARE - INTERIOR The following section describes pollutants from homes that have the potential to adversely affect our environment if not handled properly. A. Household Hazardous Waste Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) include a wide range of waste types generated from a residential home site, containing chemical compounds that can potentially pose threats to human health and the environment when improperly handled or disposed. HHW is a type of solid waste, that is not regulated as a ""hazardous waste"" by State and Federal hazardous waste regulations, by virtue of its source of generation, the residential home. However, HHW can pollute the environment if improperly managed or disposed. Many HHW items can be identified by certain signal words found on container labels, such as Danger, Poison, Irritant, Corrosive, Toxic, Warning, and Caution.  1. Household Sources of HHW Common HHW items include:      Automotive maintenance products (i.e., lead acid batteries, oils, gasoline, antifreeze, carburetor cleaners, etc.); Home cleaning agents (i.e., oven cleaner, furniture cleaner, floor cleaners and strippers, toilet cleaners, disinfectants, etc.); Home maintenance products (i.e., paints, stains, paint thinner, solvents, paint stripper, drain cleaners, pesticides, etc.); Lawn and garden chemicals (i.e., herbicides, insecticides, fertilizers, etc.); Medical waste and pharmaceuticals (i.e., unwanted/outdated drugs, medicines) and sharps (syringes, needles and other sharp tools and instruments used in administering medications).  55   For a comprehensive list of the types of HHW found in the home, the hazardous chemicals associated with them and waste management recommendations go to http://www.epa.gov/grtlakes/seahome/housewaste/src/open.htm HHW polluting the environment Since HHW products contain a wide range of chemical substances if improperly disposed or spilled, they can be released into our environment and cause harm. These chemical pollutants can contaminate air, surface water, groundwater, soils and impact plant life, aquatic life and wildlife. These chemical substances can be released into our environment in many ways including dumping, spilling, pouring on the ground; dumping or discharging in or near stormdrains, ditches, swales , ponds, streams or other bodies of water; pouring or flushing down drains and into our septic systems; dumping or discarding in open dumps or unlined landfills; open burning or releasing into our air, etc. Merely throwing an HHW item in the trash can contributes to environmental pollution if the trash can leaks and allows the substance to release into the open environment. Pollutants from HHW could also be released into the environment from leaking trash trucks. Once the substance is in the open environment it can evaporate into the air, seep into the soil or discharge into surface and groundwater by rainfall or other precipitation events. Even at designated solid waste disposal facilities, chemical substances from HHW can be released into the environment if the site is not equipped with an adequate liner and leachate collection system, and other environmental protection standards now required by State and Federal laws and regulations or not followed. In instances where HHW products can not be completely used, and disposal is the only option, separating HHW items and delivering them to an HHW collection program provides a much safer and protective mechanism for disposal of HHW. Preventing HHW pollution Pollution of our environment from the chemical substances found in HHW can be minimized, and in some cases, eliminated by following some recommended waste reduction, pollution prevention and waste management practices. They include: 1. Waste Prevention - Don't generate the waste! Consider less hazardous alternatives, products; purchase only quantities needed. 2. Reuse - Use up entire contents; find others who may be able to use the remainder of the product. 56   3. Recycling/HHW Collection Program (consider this option only when all other reuse options have been exhausted) Contact State and local agencies for available HHW collection programs. See MDE Fact Sheet entitled: Local Household Hazardous Materials Collection Programs. Many of the HHW items collected at these collection events are recycled. For example, many of the oil based paints , solvents, thinners, gasoline and other flammable substances are blended and used as fuels in industrial boilers and furnaces. Source: MDE Fact Sheets entitled: Safe Cleaning Tips/ Save Laundry tips, Recycling Automobile Products and Hazardous Household Products. A special note on Used Oil Recycling - Under Maryland law it is illegal to dump or discharge oil on the land, in any body of water, or in any location likely to pollute waters of the State. There are several locations throughout the State where homeowners can take used oil and antifreeze for recycling. Used automotive petroleum products such as engine oil, transmission fluid, break fluid, hydraulic oil, gear oil, etc., can be taken to many auto repair shops, service stations, etc., for recycling. Used oils can also be taken to many other locations such as homeowner drop off centers for solid waste in the Maryland counties. The Maryland Used Motor Oil Recycling Program is a statewide program managed by the Maryland Environmental Service (MES). MES has worked in cooperation with many local governments and private organizations to establish over 200 recycling centers to collect used oil. For more information on The Maryland Used Oil Recycling Program in Maryland and collection locations go to www.menv.com/content/recycling/oil.htm A special note on used Antifreeze recycling- Antifreeze contains ethylene glycol, an organic compound, which is toxic to humans, animals and aquatic life. Used antifreeze is recyclable and like used oil can be taken to recycling locations throughout the State. The State of Maryland Used Antifreeze Recycling Program, managed by MES, is a statewide program established in 1990.  57   For more information on The State of Maryland Used Antifreeze Recycling Program in Maryland and collection locations go to www.menv.com/content/recycling/antifreeze.html  4. Safe Use/Safe Storage -There are several recommendations on using and storing hazardous household products safely to prevent unnecessary exposure to humans and release into the environment. For example:  Avoid storing flammable products and chemicals, such as oil based paint and gasoline, containing high concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in warm environments, or in sunlight since this may result in harmful releases of VOCs into the atmosphere.  Avoid storing flammable substances near any ignition sources.  When using hazardous products and chemicals outside, always place containers in a pan or some other container to contain spills, leakage and dripage.  Never store incompatible products together such as acids and alkalis since they can react violently if spilled or mixed together.  Store products in their original, labeled containers to avoid future misidentification.  Never mix unknown products or chemicals.  Always store products in tightly sealed containers to avoid spills and leaks.  Store hazardous products in the safest locations in the house and always out of the reach of children. For more information on safe product use and storage recommendations go to www.epa.gov//grtlakes/seahome/housewaste/src. 5. Safe Disposal (consider the disposal option when all other reuse/recycling options have been exhausted) - Improper disposal of HHW can result in serious impacts to human health and release into the environment. Some HHW can be corrosive, irritating to eyes and skin, highly flammable or explosive. Sewer systems have exploded, garbage trucks have burned and sanitation workers have been seriously injured as a result of people carelessly discarding flammable, reactive, corrosive and toxic HHW. Considering safe disposal practices such as proper packaging and handling of wastes and reading disposal instructions on labels can prevent risks of human exposure and release into the environment. Remember, to avoid possible releases to the environment and potential exposure to public 58   health, local HHW collection should be over household trash disposal at home whenever possible. For other resources available on safe disposal of HHW go to www.epa.gov/grtlakes/seahome/housewaste/src/dispose.htm (Rest in Peace: Safe Disposal) and www.wef.org/publicinfo/factsheets/household_chart.jhtml  2. Medical Wastes Medical wastes are special types of HHW and generally include unused portions of drugs, medicines and sharps. Medical wastes are often generated in the household by homeowners that administer drugs and medications to themselves or by home healthcare providers. Unused portions of drugs and medicines should be disposed of in the household trash or flushed down the toilet to the sanitary sewer. Homeowners with septic systems should avoid flushing drugs and medicines down the toilet since they may be harmful to septic systems and groundwater. ""Sharps"" is a term used for certain tools and devices that aid in the administering of drugs and medications. Sharps include needles, syringes, scissors, scalpels, pins and other instruments that are capable of puncturing and cutting. The most significant hazard associated with sharps is that they can cause serious physical injury to the body and exposure to human health. Because of these dangers, sharps require special handling and disposal. Sharps can not be recycled and should only be properly disposed of. Sharps should not be tossed in the trash haphazardly, nor should they be placed in soft containers such as milk jugs or cartons that can be easily punctured. Sharps should be wrapped securely in paper or other material, placed in tough plastic or metal containers, such as detergent containers or coffee cans with tightly sealed lids, and placed safely in the trash can. For information on pharmaceutical and medical wastes (including sharps) go to www.epa.gov/grtlakes/seahome/housewaste/house/pharm.htm and www.epa.gov/grtlakes/seahome/housewaste/src/sharps.htm  59   B. Lead Chemical Symbol: Pb, is a heavy, soft, pliable, gray metal that was commonly added to household paint until 1978. Lead based paint increased: drying time; durability; ability to handle weather changes: and prevented rust and corrosion on metal. In households, lead is found in paint, mini-blinds, plumbing (old pipes, lead solder), crystal glass, ceramics, old toys, industrial releases, firing ranges (ammunition), fishing sinkers, etc. Lead is absorbed into the bloodstream and attached to red blood cells, especially if you do not get enough iron. It makes these cells die earlier than normal. Lead reduces the body's ability to make more red blood cells in the bone marrow. The blood is filtered through the kidneys where it can cause further damage and lead to kidney failure. Lead is found throughout the house but the hazard results from friction on surfaces creating lead dust and chips. Because lead is a heavy, sticky metal, it does not remain in the air long, but rather settles on horizontal surfaces such as floors, window ledges, window wells, doors, stairs, fireplace mantles, other trim, interior and exterior window sashes, other exterior surfaces, etc. It is also found in drinking water flowing through old lead pipes and lead soldered pipes. The main detriment to the environment is of incorrect disposal of lead waste as a result of home remodeling or sloppy lead risk reduction or abatement work. Lead can be prevented or reduced by remediation and/or abatement of the affected areas with proper containment methods and occupant protection. By replacing windows, a major source of the lead dust from the home is removed. Rent or buy housing built after 1978 or older housing with paint in good condition. Run water through lead pipes prior to drinking it to flush out the lead, unless you have PVC water pipes. Dust from lead paint and lead fumes Lead dust particles are so small they can be breathed in or swallowed (usually swallowed by children). If dust particles have contacted things that are later placed in your mouth (such as food, fingers, soda cans). Lead dust is cumulative and causes health problems that are often irreversible. Following exposure, lead accumulates 60   and is stored throughout the body. Lead poisoning usually results from many small exposures over a period of weeks or years. Lead fumes pose another danger. When lead solder or lead paint are heated, fumes containing many tiny lead particles are released. Particles in the fumes travel through the air, and are easy to breathe and can go through a dust mask. The fumes travel to lungs and then to the blood. Heated paint can also release dangerous organic vapors that come from chemicals used in the paint. Because of this, avoid burning lead based paint. Lead damages the nervous system (brain, spinal chord and nerves). Damage to the nervous system can be permanent. Lead can kill brain cells and have side effects such as decrease in intelligence, depression, irritability, forgetfulness, clumsiness, hallucination, swelling of the brain, coma and even death. Lead damages the nerves' ability to give and take messages resulting in hands shaking, hand and foot drop. If you get wrist drop or foot drop, you many never regain use of your hand or foot. Lead stays in the blood for weeks, it remains in the brain and other soft tissues for several months, and it can be stored in bones for many decades. Lead released from storage in bone can also cause lead poisoning years after the original exposure. Lead Poisoning in Children: Young children, less than six years of age, are of special concern because their developing brains and other organs can easily be damaged by lead. It is normal for young children to put everything, including hands, pacifiers and toys, into their mouths. Anything that contains lead, from small dust particles to large paint chips, can cause harm if swallowed. Lead poisoning causes learning and behavior problems that may be permanent in young children. Lead poisoning often goes unnoticed. A child with lead poisoning may seem to be well, since symptoms usually do not show until the condition becomes quite serious developing without the parent's knowledge. When symptoms occur, they are easy to confuse with symptoms of other illnesses such as the ""flu."" Blood lead tests are the only way to detect lead poisoning early and are part of the routine health care recommended for all young children. Lead Poisoning In Adults: The most important sources of lead exposure for adults are found in the work place. People who breathe lead fumes from activities such as the removal of old paint or the manufacture of lead products are at high risk for lead poisoning. Workers with lead dust on their hands can also contaminate the 61   food that they eat and the cigarettes that they smoke. An adult who has lead poisoning may notice fatigue, irritability, headache, weight loss, stomachache, or constipation. But lead can cause damage without any symptoms. Blood tests are important for anyone who works with lead on the job, in a hobby, or in any other activity. Lead can be dangerous to the male and female reproductive systems. Lead Poisoning in Pregnancy: A mother's exposure to lead early in her life can also affect her unborn baby. Lead carried in the mother's blood is passed to her unborn child. During pregnancy, lead stored in a mother's bones is released, along with calcium needed by the fetus, into the mother's blood stream. Research now shows that lead at very low levels can have toxic effects on the developing fetus. Lead toxicity may cause miscarriage or premature birth. Infants born with only slightly elevated blood lead levels have been found to have developmental problems.  1. Paint Recognized methods of remediation are: Replacement  Remove the deteriorated window or affected piece/trim and replace it with a new one. This method is recommended for windows, doors and other woodwork that are painted with lead-based paint. Advantages: The lead-based paint is removed forever and is a permanent solution. Replacing windows can upgrade the building and lower heating bills. Airborne lead dust is minimized. Disadvantages: The replacement part may not be as good as the original part and it is expensive. Replacement can involve demolition work and create a lot of lead dust and solid waste. Enclosure  Cover the lead-based paint with a solid, dust-tight barrier. The materials used must be durable such as: aluminum, panelling, fiberboard, vinyl, plywood, drywall, tile or acrylic sheets. Wallpaper and contact paper are not enclosure materials, since they are not dust-tight. The new surface must be strong and in place permanently so that it cannot be removed. Enclosure advantages:  improve the appearance and value of a property  provide added thermal insulation to a property  worker exposure during enclosure is relatively low  inexpensive for large, flat surfaces Enclosure disadvantages:  not a permanent solution, lead source still remains underneath 62    future renovation or repair work to the enclosed surface will disturb the leadbased paint  how long the enclosure lasts is not known  lead dust will be released and collect behind the enclosure barrier  enclosed surfaces and joints must be monitored for damage and deterioration  may not be appropriate to apply to all surfaces Encapsulation  Coat lead-based painted surface with a thick, durable sealing material so that it is not accessible. Encapsulants are best used on building materials that are in good condition. An encapsulant with mesh is needed for surfaces that are chipping or peeling. Encapsulants must be flexible and strong covering the surface with a dust-tight seal. These products must be individually approved by MDE prior to their use. Encapsulation Advantages:  least expensive method for lead paint abatement, except for interior doors  worker exposure to encapsulation is relatively low  works on almost any type of substrate  effective in hard to reach areas Encapsulation Disadvantages:  not a permanent solution  lead source remains under the covering  future renovation to the area disturbs the lead-based paint underneath  encapsulated surfaces must be inspected regularly for damage and deterioration.  how long the encapsulation lasts is not known  quality depends on how the material is applied and on environmental conditions such as humidity  exposure to organic solvents can be a serious problem during application for both workers and occupants  possible failure due to incorrect surface preparation  should not be used in friction areas.  some encapsulants create hazardous waste which need proper regulated disposal methods. Paint removal Remove lead based paint by using: wet scraping and planing, electric heat guns, HEPA Sanders, HEPA  Needle Guns, chemical strippers and off-site stripping. Also exterior abrasive blasting) The various paint removal methods create a lot of lead dust and waste. 63   Wet scraping is a process that mists loose paint before scraping in order to keep lead dust levels down while scraping. This process does not removal all of the paint - only the loose paint. Wet scraping and painting can be used as an interim control. Wet planing is similar to wet scraping except that a wood plane tool is used instead of a scraping tool. This process is best used to remove lead-based paint from impact surfaces like the edges of a door or on friction surfaces like window edges that rub together. Chemical Strippers are prepared chemical solvents that dissolve paint. The caustic paste melts the paint into the goo that is scraped off with hand tools. Exterior Abrasive or Vacuum Blasting. The nozzle of the vacuum blaster is surrounded by a co-axially mounted exhaust hood that captures used shot and abraided surface coatings. This process is used effectively on large unobstructed surfaces such as water towers and tanks. Alternatives  use paint made without lead with consideration to the particular surface you will be covering (such as latex).  replace lead pipes with copper or PVC pipes  do not use lead solder  purchase miniblinds made in the United States to ensure lead free materials are used  rent or buy housing built after 1978 or which has had paint management using safe procedures (lead free, lead safe, risk reduction treatment) Reducing Lead Pollution Use proper cleanup and disposal of lead waste from remediation and/or abatement work. Have Maryland State certified lead risk reduction workers and supervisors who utilize correct work practices and containment in the work areas.  64   Economic Impact Children brain damaged by exposure to lead paint will cost the taxpayer millions of dollars in medical as well as educational care during their lifetimes. The economic impact is compounded by the lifetime effects suffered by the people poisoned by lead. Children incurring severe lead poisoning before the age of 6 will be mentally challenged for the rest of their lives and may have other complications such as hyperactivity and attention-deficit disorders. Due to the severity of the lead poisoning and the fact that most often the children come from poor, disadvantaged, single parent households, they may require full time caretakers that are paid fully by tax dollars.

Plumbing Lead is found in some pipes and in lead solder. Lead dust and fumes cause health problems that are often irreversible. The main detriment to natural resources is of incorrect disposal of lead pipe or lead solder waste as a result of home remodeling or lead risk reduction or abatement work. This is a hazardous waste (lead pipes and lead solder) and cannot be thrown in trashcans. It must be properly wrapped and shipped for disposal off-site. Preventing Lead in plumbing Buy or rent housing built after 1978, or remove lead pipes and lead solder and replace with copper or plastic (PVC) piping.

Recycling Every day, Maryland homes and businesses produce 39 million pounds of solid waste. In just ten days, Marylanders throw away enough trash to fill a convoy of garbage trucks stretching from one end of the State to the other! Across the United States, people are becoming more aware of their role in promoting sensible disposal practices that will reduce the volume of solid waste and protect the environment. Waste reduction at the source and recycling as alternatives to conventional waste disposal are initiatives being embraced by residents and businesses alike. Maryland's citizens have responded well to the challenge of reducing the amount of waste entering our landfills. In 1999, the State achieved a 36% recycling rate, diverting 2.1 million tons from being buried or burned. But recycling only counts materials that have entered the waste stream. Until this year, there had been no way to provide credit for initiatives which reduced the amount of waste produced  whether it was disposed or recycled.  Maryland's Recycling Rate Has Steadily Increased Since 1992 40%  Recycling Rate (%)  10% 5% 0% 1992  1993  19%  15%  1994  25%  20%  1995  27%  1996  28%  1997  29%  25%  1998  32%  Reporting Period  For 2000, Maryland has crafted a ""Source Reduction Credit System,"" which provides measureable credit up to 5% of the total amount of waste generated in the State. Now, initiatives such as leaving grass clippings on the lawn rather than bagging them (grasscycling) count towards the State's new 40% waste diversion goal to be achieved by 2005. 68  1999  33%  30%  36%  35%   There are many reasons recycling and source reduction make good sense:    Recycling saves energy. For example, making new aluminum cans from recycled aluminum uses 95% less energy than the same process using raw materials. Recycling conserves natural resources. This is especially true when we recycle metal, paper and glass. Recycling helps protect the environment. By reducing the amount of waste we generate, we help minimize the threat posed by harmful substances within the waste stream. Recycling also reduces the volume of waste that must be incinerated or landfilled.  Some commonly recycled materials are: GLASS: Jars and bottles can be recycled into new jars and containers.  PAPER: Office paper, computer paper, corrugated cardboard, magazines, and newsprint can be pulped and remade into new paper or used in products like egg cartons, roofing and insulation.  ALUMINUM AND OTHER METALS: Soft drink cans, lawn furniture , aluminum siding, tin cans, auto bodies, pipes, stoves and batteries can all be recycled into new products.  MOTOR OIL: Crankcase oil from automobiles, lawn mowers, and tractors can be re-refined for use as heating oil and motor oil.  ANTIFREEZE: Antifreeze from your automobile can be recycled and used again.  PLASTIC: Soda bottles, milk jugs and detergent containers can be processed to make fibrous materials for sleeping bags and jackets. They can also be recycled to form pipes, lumber, buckets and other containers.  TIRES: Car, truck, and tractor tires can be retreaded or recycled into raw materials for roads, fuel, or truckbed liners. In Maryland, a $0.40 tire fee is charged when you buy a new tire to support statewide programs, such as cleaning up existing tire stockpiles, regulating the scrap tire industry, and developing projects to reduce, recover, and recycle scrap tires. Experts believe that up to 80% of the things we throw away can be diverted through reducing, reusing and recycling. Let's look at what can be done in the home to divert as much material as possible from landfills and incinerators: Reuse as much as you can.  Donate used items such as clothing, furniture and bicycles to charitable organizations rather than throwing them away. 69             Reuse containers for storing such items as food, hardware, or craft items. Save and reuse plastic bags, wrapping paper, boxes and lumber. Pass on magazines, books and catalogs to neighbors, hospitals, or nursing homes. Compost excess food and plant materials. The resulting material will make your garden grow to new heights. Reduce consumption of materials requiring disposal Buy items with less packaging. One large bag of potato chips is more environmentally friendly than 12 individual snack-sized bags. Buy products in recyclable containers. Avoid buying disposable items Buying products made from recycled materials will help to ensure continued demand for the materials you recycle. Look for the ""recycled"" symbol on the products you buy. To ensure recycling's success, the loop must be closed.  1. Waste Minimization The federal Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 defines pollution prevention as ""source reduction"" and other practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants through   increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water, or other resources, or protection of natural resources by conservation.  The Pollution Prevention Act also defines ""source reduction"" to mean any practice which  reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal (see waste management hierarchy below); and reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants, or contaminants.    The five basic techniques of source reduction are raw material substitution, good housekeeping, process modifications, product reformulation, and product redesign.

Waste Disposal Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is that portion of the waste stream that includes household garbage and other solid waste materials from schools, businesses and commercial enterprises. The solid waste that we generate must be managed properly otherwise serious harm may be caused to both the environment and public health. Improper disposal of MSW in open dumps is unsightly, unsanitary and unlawful. All MSW generated in Maryland and for that matter the United States must be disposed of at permitted solid waste accepatance facilities. Typical methods of disposal include landfilling and incineration. Disposed of improperly, MSW may allow man-made chemicals to enter into and degrade groundwater and surface water. All MSW landfills are required to have liners and leachate collection systems. When the landfills reach capacity they must be capped to prevent water from seeping in through the trash. Incinerators must meet certain requirements under the Clean Air Act to control emissions. Promote methods for the recycling and reuse of the various materials that comprise MSW. Recycling waste materials and creating new products will help to preserve our natural resources and protect the environment. Report open dumping to the proper authorities. The Maryland Department of the Environment, is the lead agency that regulates the handling and disposal of MSW in Maryland. MSW material can be disposed of in permitted landfills that are required to meet minimum operating requirements as stipulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D, 40 CFR parts 257 and 258, Maryland Environment Article Title 9 Subtitle 2, and COMAR Title 26 Subtitle 4.

Tire Recycling A scrap tire is any tire that is no longer suitable for its original intended purpose by virtue of wear, damage or defect. There are approximately four to five million scrap tires generated in Maryland every year. Tires have been banned for disposal in landfills in Maryland since 1991. Tires do not readily decompose, therefore, taking up valuable landfill space. Due to their structure, tires buried in a landfill will migrate toward the surface as the surrounding trash decomposes thus creating futures problems when the landfill is capped. Improperly disposed of tires are not only unsightly but pose a threat to human health and the environment. Because they hold water, tires are excellent breeding grounds for mosquitoes that may carry diseases such as LaCrosse encephalitits, St. Louis encephalitis and most recently West Nile encephalitis. Tire piles may also provide breeding grounds for rats. Tire dumps are also fire hazards. If ignited the tires burn with intense heat, produce thick, acrid smoke and can generate oil that may pollute soil, ground and surface water. Tire piles that have ignited must often be pulled apart using heavy equipment and then sprayed with water or foam to extinguish the flames. Before Maryland had laws regulating the storage and disposal of scrap tires, there were an estimated eight million illegally stockpiled tires throughout the state. Realizing the potential threat to public health and the environment the General Assembly passed the Maryland Scrap Tire Recycling Act in 1991. The act established a State-wide system for cleaning up the existing tire dumps and focused attention on the continued management of scrap tires through a system of licenses required for the collection, hauling, processing and recycling of scrap tires. As a result the majority of Maryland's scrap tires have become a beneficial resource.  72   In Fiscal Year 2000 approximately two million scrap tires were used as fuel at cement kilns or as fuel at waste to energy facilities. Another three million tires were shredded and then used for other projects including drainage layers in landfills or as raw materials in the production of playground surfaces and other innovative products. The MDE, along with the assistance of other agencies and volunteers, has constructed eight scrap tire playgrounds throughout the state. The MDE is the lead regulatory agency regarding the management of scrap tires.

HOUSEHOLD CARE - EXTERIOR A. Lawn and Garden Care Many homeowners desire expanses of lush, green, weed-free lawn as a part of their landscape. This desire for perfection, besides being time-consuming, has led to a greater use of chemicals to encourage growth and eliminate weeds, insects, and diseases. The result is excess applications of fertilizer, herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides, which contribute to an increase in contaminants in our ground and surface water. According to the Maryland Department of Agriculture, there are over 685,000 acres of residential lawns in Maryland. Of that, 675,000 acres surround single family homes, and the remaining 10,000 acres surround town homes. If everyone over fertilized their lawn by just one pound, a huge amount of contaminants could end up in our ground water, streams, rivers, lakes, and the Chesapeake Bay. Uninformed homeowners, in their zeal to create a beautiful landscape, can inadvertently cause environmental problems. These problems include air and water pollution, soil erosion, and wasted water. Water and fertilizer are wasted when they are allowed to run over the surface of the ground and into storm drains. Soil erosion occurs when, during rain, bare soil is washed off the land into storm drains or ditches. Gas-powered lawn mower can produce as much pollution in one hour as driving a car for ten hours. This not only contaminates the air we breath, but the pollutants can also settle out of the air onto the land and waterways, to eventually end up in neighborhood creeks and in the Bay. Runoff from composting, deck washing and sealing and car washing may carry pollutants into the waterways. An alternative to washing vehicles drive ways or street is to wash vehicles on grass, allowing the grass to filter out dirt and chemicals before it reaches the storm drain or curb area.

In contrast, xeriscape landscaping provides households with a framework that can dramatically reduce the potential for NPS pollution. Xeriscape incorporates many environmental factors into landscape design--soil type, use of native plants, practical turf areas, proper irrigation, mulches, and appropriate maintenance schedules. By using native plants that are well-suited to a regions climate and pests, xeriscape drastically reduces the need for irrigation and chemical applications. Less irrigation results in less runoff, while less chemical application keeps runoff clean Source: Maryland Department of the Environment at www.mde.state.md.us; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Managing Nonpoint Source Pollution from Households Fact Sheet, Pointer No.10 EPA841-F-96-004J at www.epa.gov/owowwtr1/NPS/facts/point10.htm; The Quality of Our Nation's Water: 1994 (EPA-841-S-95-004) Xeriscape Landscaping: Preventing Pollution and Using Resources Efficiently (EPA840-B-93-001) at www.epa.gov/OWOW/NPS/index.html Bayscapes, Homeowners' Guide to Designing Your Property (attached) www.acbonline.org.  75   1. Pesticides, Herbicides and Insecticides Pesticides, when misapplied or disposed of, can contaminate ground and surface waters. In order for a pesticide to be used safely, every detail of the label instructions must be followed. An insecticide or herbicide must be applied at the right time, to the right pest, in the proper manner and at the correct rate. If any of these factors aren't done correctly, there is great risk of contamination, whether through leaching, runoff, or drift. Economic Impact of Pesticide and Fertilizer Misuse When pesticides and fertilizers are misused in our homes and yards, it creates non-point source pollution. Excess nutrients are the major contributing pollution source of the State's water resources, especially the Chesapeake Bay. Poor water quality, whether rendering it unfit for human consumption, or for aquatic life, costs the state, companies and individuals millions of dollars in treatment, preventative measures, remediation and loss revenue. Millions of dollars are lost each year due to the collapse of fisheries in the bay, caused by nutrient pollution. Source: The Maryland HomeWork Program at http://www.agcom.purdue.edu/AgCom/Pubs/WQ/WQ-19.html  2. Yard Waste It is estimated that yard waste, including g rass clippings, leaves and brush, comprises between 14% and 20% of all the waste that we put into our landfills. This figure is most significant in the fact that we do not need to take up precious landfill space with a material that can be easily recycled and reused in our own back yard. Yard waste contains nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, all of which are necessary for proper plant growth. Improper disposal of yard waste can cause harmful effects to the environment. When people dump grass clippings and leaves into storm drains or surface waters they allow excess nutrients to enter into the aquatic environment and adversely affect the various organisms by depleting much needed dissolved oxygen concentrations.  76   As the nutrients enter into the aquatic environment bacteria that utilize them for food begin to flourish and multiply. As the aerobic bacteria consume the nutrients they also use up the dissolved oxygen. As the nutrients are used up, the bacteria begin to die. Again the dissolved oxygen is depleted during the decomposition of the bacteria. Fish and other organisms that need the dissolved oxygen to survive begin to die. Maryland is one of many states that has banned the landfilling of separately collected loads of yard waste. Therefore, most counties in Maryland provide for the recycling of yard waste. Montgomery County composts and recycles approximately 70,000 tons of grass and leaves each year. While Montgomery sells the resulting product most counties provide the mulch to the public for free.  a) Composting Backyard composting is another alternative. Composting is the process by which organic material is converted to a soil-like condition. Some of the things you can compost includes, grass, leaves, wool and cotton rags, fireplace ashes, sawdust, and many kitchen wastes such as eggshells, coffee grounds, tea bags and vegetable trimmings. There are books, fact sheets and many other reference materials available to assist the homeowner. ""Grasscycling"" is the concept on the lawn where they can provide for expensive fertilizers and other only helps to preserve landfill space Statutes/regulations The Maryland Recycling Act is embodied primarily in the Annotated Code of Maryland, Environment Article Section 9-1701 through 9-1724 which bans the acceptance of separately collected loads of yard waste for final disposal at landfills in Maryland. The Maryland Department of the Environment, is the lead agency that regulates the disposal of solid waste in Maryland - COMAR Title 26 Subtitle 4.

Recycling yard waste materials not but also protects the environment.   b) Pet Waste Pet waste left to decay on the sidewalk, or on grass near the street, may be washed into storm drains by rain or melting snow. Drainage from storm drains usually does not flow to a sewage treatment plant. Instead, most storm drains flow directly into our waterways, carrying many pollutants along with the water. When pet waste is washed into lakes or streams, it may carry disease-causing organisms, which make water unsafe for swimming or drinking. The waste decays, using up oxygen and sometimes releasing ammonia. Low oxygen levels and ammonia combined with warm temperatures can kill fish. Cleaning up after your pet can be as simple as taking a plastic bag or pooper scooper along on your next walk. Disposal options include 1) flushing pet waste down the toilet; 2) burying it in the yard or 3) putting it in the trash. To prevent water pollution around your home: clean up areas near wells, sewer inlets, ditches, and waterways. Always remove waste from areas where children play. they are the most frequent victims of diseases from pet waste.

You cannot see, smell, or taste it. Radon occurs naturally in all soils. In outdoor air, radon gas is diluted to low levels. When radon gas seeps into homes, it can build up to potentially dangerous levels. Radon is a health hazard, scientists estimate that 7,000 to 14,000 lung cancer deaths a year in the United States may be caused by radon gas. This would make radon the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. Radon is one part of a long chain of radioactive decay. As radon decays, its byproducts may get trapped in your lungs and release radiation. There is scientific evidence that this radiation can damage lung tissue. This lung tissue damage can eventually lead to lung cancer. The higher your radon level, and the longer you are exposed to it, the greater your risk. Radon in Maryland Homeowners in every county and Baltimore City have reported elevated levels of radon. The only way to know for sure whether your home has a radon problem is to test. Some Maryland homes have radon levels higher than 200 pico-curies per liter (pCi/l) of air (pico-curies per liter is a measure of radiation). These levels are 50 times higher than the action guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. By spending your lifetime in a house with radon levels of 10 pCi/l you have a lung cancer risk similar to smoking nearly a pack of cigarettes a day. Radon can enter your home through cracks in your home's foundation, dirt floors, pores in block walls, floor drains, and sumps. While radon usually enters through the basement or lower floors, it also circulates throughout your entire house. Radon levels can vary a great deal, even in the same neighborhood. Mostly, radon levels depend on how easy it is for the radon to get into your home and the amount of radon in the ground under your home.  79   Testing Because you cannot see radon, you must use a radon detector to measure the levels in your home. It is a simple do-it-yourself home test that comes with easy-tofollow instructions. When the test is completed, you send the detector back to the testing company, which analyzes it and sends you your results. The two most common types of radon detectors are the charcoal detector and the alpha tack detector. FOR MORE INFORMATION, call the RADON HOTLINE, 1-800-767-7236, and you will receive lists of radon testing and mitigation companies, along with these U.S. Environmental Protection Agency booklets: ""A Citizen's Guide to Radon (Second Edition)"" ""Consumer's Guide to Radon Reduction"" ""Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon""  1. Leaf/Open Burning The open burning of leaves and yard debris in residential areas can be a significant source of air pollutants including nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter, volatile organic compounds (VOC), partially combusted hydrocarbons. Open burning of leaves produces the smoke and emissions that contain and release the pollutants into the air. These pollutants are harmful to the health of humans and animals. High concentrations of CO can cause headaches, fatigue, and even death. Particulate can enter the lungs and damage lung tissue. Certain hydrocarbons are known carcinogens. An option to open burning of leaves is composting the material and using it to nourish soil for gardens or fields. Leaves can also be bagged and collected by public or private sanitation agencies. Statutes/regulations Maryland has developed and implemented regulations to address open burning. Generally, open burning requires a permit issued by county health departments. In the summer months (June, July and August), there is a ban on open burning except for emergencies (such as to destroy a diseased or pest-infested crop). 80   Even when properly permitted, there are restrictions such as not creating a nuisance and not creating a hazardous situation. Permits are generally not required for burning leaves when public pick up is not provided.

Ozone Pollution Ground level ozone is a ""secondary pollutant,"" formed in the air as a result of a chemical change in several primary pollutants, caused through the use of gasoline-powered lawn and garden equipment, oil-based paints, solvents, and tailpipe emissions. Affects of Ozone pollution on the environment:   Ground-level ozone has been shown to reduce agricultural yields for many economically important crops (e.g., soybeans, kidney beans, wheat, cotton) Ground-level ozone can kill or damage leaves so that they fall off the plants too soon or become spotted or brown. These effects can significantly decrease the natural beauty of an area, such as in national parks and recreation areas. One of the key components of ozone, nitrogen oxides, contributes to fish kills and algae blooms in sensitive waterways, such as the Chesapeake Bay Ozone can cause eye and throat irritation, shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing, and lung inflammation Exposure to ozone is especially stressful to people with respiratory illnesses, eg. bronchitis, asthma and emphysema Ozone's impact on lung tissue is like that of the sun's impact on skin, ozone causes premature aging of the lung tissue.       Sources of pollutants in the household that contribute to ozone formation are gasoline for lawn mowers, paints, and solvents are usually stored in sheds, basements or garages. Ozone pollutes the environment through vehicle tailpipe emissions, gasoline powered lawn and garden equipment, household products, such as oil-based paints, and solvents which release nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air. During the warmer months of the year when there is more intense  81   sunlight, these compounds can cause the formation of ground-level ozone, the primary component of smog. Gasoline can release VOCs during refueling or spillage. Gasoline pumps are required to have vapor recovery nozzles to prevent VOCs from entering the air. Solvents and oil-based paints can release VOCs when being used. Using gasolinepowered lawn equipment and driving produce emissions that contain NOX. Ground level ozone pollution can be prevented, or reduced, by several means. First, it is important for all citizens to support the manufacture of more fuelefficient automobiles--including the development of alternative fuel vehicles and cleaner burning fuels. Second, there are a number of things we can do as individuals to help prevent or reduce ground level ozone. These include:  Refuel automobiles and lawn mowers after dusk.  Use gasoline-powered lawn equipment when ozone levels are forecasted to be low.  Use electric or manual lawn equipment.  Combine automobile trips, drive less, walk or ride a bicycle when possible. Use public transportation.  Keep vehicles well maintained.  Drive a fuel-efficient vehicle.  Use water-based paints and cleaners.  Walk, bike, or use public transportation. Statute/regulations The Clean Air Act lists ground-level ozone as a criteria pollutant and has established health-based standards for ozone. Criteria pollutant refers to six pollutants for which health-based criteria have been established by the federal government. Particulate matter 10 microns or less (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides, lead (Pb) and ozone (O3). Areas that meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are designated attainment. Areas that do not meet the NAAQS are nonattianment. Fourteen of Maryland's 24 jurisdictions are nonattainment for ozone. They include Frederick, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George's, Charles, Calvert, Cecil, Kent and Queen Anne's Counties and Baltimore City. States have to develop state implementation plans that explain how each state will do its job under the Clean Air Act. 82   Maryland has 31 monitor sites across the state. Sixteen sites have ozone monitors. The monitoring system is one way in which the state is working to clean its air and achieve attainment for ozone. Maryland also has an Air Quality Compliance Program, Air Quality Permits Program and a Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program (VEIP). VEIP tests over 1.2 million passenger vehicles annually to remove nitrogen oxides from the air. There are 19 VEIP stations in the areas where vehicles are required to get a test every two years.

Acid Rain Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) react in the atmosphere with water and oxygen to form acid compounds, known as acid rain. Acid rain degrades man-made materials, buildings, forests, and sensitive bodies of water. The pollutants SO2 and NOx form acid compounds in the atmosphere. These acidic compounds then fall to earth in either dry form (gas or particulate) or wet form (rain, snow or fog). The compounds fall onto buildings, trees, and soils and react causing degradation. Oxides of nitrogen are a by-product of using gasoline and diesel fuel and come from tailpipe emissions from vehicles. Utility plants that rely on coal to generate electricity for our homes are the largest source of SO2 and also a source of NOx. Reduce automobile use by walking, bicycling, carpooling, and using public transit to reduce NOx emissions. Conserve electricity at home and at work by turning off lights and appliances that are not being used. Consider purchasing your electricity from a company that does not use coal or from a company that uses advanced emissions control technology. Statutes/regulations 83   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Acid Rain Program has the goal of reducing SO2 and NOx emissions. Title IV of the Clean Air Act sets reduction standards. Source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at www.epa.gov/acidrain/overview.html Economic impacts Maryland's Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program requires owners of gasolinepowered cars and light trucks to have the emissions tested every two years at a fee of $12. Owners of vehicles that fail the test may have to spend between $200 and $450 in repair expenditures (depending on model year) to have the vehicle pass the test or to receive a waiver. The impact of ozone pollution on human health and the environment is costly. The American Lung Association reports that during ozone season there is an increase in emergency room visits in metropolitan areas for respiratory problems. In 1995, the EPA estimated there was $2.7 billion worth of crop damage from ozone pollution. In summary, ozone pollution causes higher costs to the consumer for health care and for groceries.  84   C. Asbestos Shingles Asbestos is a mineral fiber. It is mined in much the same way that other minerals, such as iron, lead and copper are. Asbestos is composed of silicon, oxygen, hydrogen, and various metal cations (positively charged metal ions). There are many varieties of asbestos: the three most common are chrysotile, amosite and crocidolite. Chrysotile fibers are pliable and cylindrical, and are often arranged in bundles. Amosite and crocidolite fibers are like tiny needles. Asbestos can be positively identified only with the use of a special type of microscope. Asbestos cement roofing, shingles and siding can be found on residential homes and but are not likely to release asbestos fibers unless sawed, drilled, or cut. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that the asbestos content of suspect materials be determined by collecting bulk samples and analyzing them by polarized light microscopy (PLM). The PLM technique determines both the percent and types of asbestos in the bulk material. EPA Regional Offices can provide information concerning laboratories that test for asbestos. Asbestos polluting the environment Damaged asbestos containing material (ACM) is more likely to release fibers than non-damaged ACM. If ACM, when dry, can be crumbled by hand pressure, a condition known as ""friable"", it is more likely to release fibers than if it is ""nonfriable"". Fluffy, spray-applied asbestos fireproofing material is generally considered ""friable"". Some materials that are considered to be ""non-friable"", such as vinyl asbestos floor tile, can also release fibers when sanded, sawed or otherwise aggressively disturbed. ACM which is in a heavy traffic area, and which is therefore often disturbed is more likely to release fibers than ACM in a relatively undisturbed area. Some people exposed to asbestos develop asbestos-related health problems but some do not. Once inhaled, asbestos fibers can easily penetrate body tissues. Because asbestos fibers remain in the body, each exposure increases the likelihood of developing as asbestos-related disease. Asbestos related diseases might not appear for 20 to 40 years. Today we are seeing the results of exposure among asbestos workers during World War II. A medical examination that includes a medical history, breathing capacity test and chest x-ray may detect problems early. 85   Statutes/regulations In 1989 EPA published the Asbestos: Manufacture, Importation, Processing, and Distribution in Commerce Prohibitions Final Rule (40CFR Part 763, Subpart I). The rule will eventually ban about 94 percent of asbestos used in the U.S. (based on 1985 estimates). For example, asbestos containing drum brake linings and roof coating will be banned. The rule was to be implemented in three stages between 1990 and 1997, however the Courts have stayed the rule. In 1979, under the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA), EPA began an asbestos technical assistance program for building owners, environmental groups, contractors and industry. In May 1982, EPA issued the first regulation intended to control asbestos in schools under the authority of TSCA. This regulation was known as the Asbestos-in-Schools Rule. Starting in 1985, loans and grants have been given each year to aid Local Education Agencies (LEAs) in conducting asbestosis projects under the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Act (ASHAA). The regulation may be found at: www.epa.gov/opptintr/asbestos/asbreg.htm#tsca. The Clean Air Acts (CAA) of 1970 and 1990 require EPA to develop and enforce regulations to protect the general public from exposure to airborne contaminants that are known to be hazardous to human health. In accordance with Section 112 of the CAA, EPA established National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP). Asbestos was one of the first hazardous pollutants regulated under Section 112. On March 31, 1971, EPA identified asbestos as a hazardous pollutant, and on April 6, 1973, EPA promulgated the Asbestos NESHAP in 40 CFR 61, Subpart M. The Asbestos NESHAP has been amended several times, most recently in November 1990. http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/asbestos/asbreg.htm#caa. The Asbestos NESHAP is intended to minimize the release of asbestos fibers during activities involving the handling of asbestos. Accordingly, it specifies work practices to be followed during renovations of buildings that contain a certain threshold amount of friable asbestos, and during demolitions of all structures, installations and facilities (except apartment buildings that have no more than four dwelling units).  86   Most often, the Asbestos NESHAP requires action to be taken by the person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises the facility being demolished or renovated (the ""owner""), and by the person who owns, leases, operates, controls or supervises the demolition or the renovation (the ""operator""). The regulations require owners and operators subject to the Asbestos NESHAP to notify delegated State and local agencies and/or their EPA Regional Offices before demolition or renovation activity begins. There are specific Occupational Safety and Health Standards for the workers who may be exposed to asbestos. These may be found at: http://www.oshaslc.gov/OshStd_toc/OSHA_Std_toc_1910_SUBPART_Z.html . These regulations cover the requirements for respiratory protection and the tests to determine if the material is asbestos. There are also regulations concerning the removal of asbestos and the protection of the worker. These may be found at: http://www.oshaslc.gov/OshStd_toc/OSHA_Std_toc_1926_SUBPART_Z.html . Enforcement of EPA's standards is delegated to the Maryland Department of the Environment, and the state also has regulations concerning the disturbance of asbestos and the licensing of contractors to conduct this activity. Regulation concerning asbestos can be found: http://209.15.49.5/dsd_web/default.htm. Economic Impact There have been no studies on the economic impact of asbestos shingles in the home. The homeowner can do removal of the shingles as long as breakage can be kept to a minimum. If the homeowner hires an asbestos contractor to do the job, the cost would increase to approximately $1,500 to $2,000.

Nonpoint Source Pollution  Nonpoint sources consist of runoff from the land, which may contain pesticides, fertilizers, metals, manure, road salt and other pollutants. Diffused sources of these nonpoint pollutants (as opposed to discrete point sources) 98   include farms, lawns, paved urban areas, construction sites, timber harvesting operations, landfills and home septic systems. Nutrients - Compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus dissolved in water which are essential to both plants and animals. Too much nitrogen and phosphorus act as pollutants and can lead to unwanted consequences - primarily algae blooms that cloud the water and rob it of oxygen critical to most forms of aquatic life. Sewage treatment plants, industries, vehicle exhaust, acid rain, and runoff from agricultural, residential and urban areas are sources of nutrients entering the Bay. O Oligohaline - Pertaining to moderately brackish water with low range salinities (from .5-5 parts per thousand) Oligotrophic - Refers to water bodies or habitats with low concentrations of nutrients.

Point Source - A source of pollution that can be attributed to a specific physical location, as in a wastewater treatment plant effluent pipe. Point Source Pollution  Pollution from industrial and sewage treatment plants. Point sources consist of pollutants that originate from a clearly identifiable discreet source and move through a conduit, such as a factory discharge pipe, into a receiving stream from a specific outlet. All industries and municipalities that discharge wastewater to a waterway must have a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, which regulates the type and amount of wastes allowed in their facilities' discharges. Pollutant  Any waste or wastewater discharged that may contaminate or alter the physical, chemical or biological properties of any surface or groundwater. Pollution  Generally, the presence of a substance in the environment, that because of its chemical composition or quantity, prevents the functioning of natural processes and produces undesirable environmental and health effects. Under the Clean Water act, for example, the term has been defined as the man-made or man-induced alteration of the physical, biological, chemical, and radiological integrity of water and other media. Pollution comes from many different sources, usually associated with rainfall runoff moving over and through the ground, carrying natural and manmade pollutants into lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands, estuaries, coastal waters and underground 100   drinking water. Two types of pollution sources are in your watershed: point and nonpoint sources. Point Source Pollution  Pollution from industrial and sewage treatment plants. Point sources consist of pollutants that originate from a clearly identifiable discreet source and move through a conduit, such as a factory discharge pipe, into a receiving stream from a specific outlet. All industries and municipalities that discharge wastewater to a waterway must have a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, which regulates the type and amount of wastes allowed in their facilities' discharges. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) - a chemical compound composed of fused six carbon rings. Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) - a chemical compound composed of a bi-phenyl group and chlorine atoms.

Riparian Forest Buffers - An area of trees, usually accompanied by shrubs and other vegetation, that is adjacent to a body of water which is managed to maintain the integrity of stream channels and shorelines, to reduce the impact of upland sources of pollution by trapping, filtering, and converting sediments , nutrients, and other chemicals, and to supply food, cover, and thermal protection to fish and other wildlife. Roe - Fish eggs, especially while still massed in the ovarian membrane; called caviar. S Salinity - A measure of the salt concentration of water. Higher salinity means more dissolved salts. Usually measured in parts per thousand. Salt marsh - A coastal habitat consisting of salt-resistant plants residing in an organic-rich sediment accreting toward sea level.

Spat - Juvenile, newly attached oysters (i.e. oyster spat). Spawn - To release eggs and/or sperm into water. Species - A population or group of populations that are in reproductive contact but are reproductively isolated from all other populations. Sprawl - A form of land development that moves outward from urban areas in a manner which creates large areas of relatively low density. Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) - rooted vegetation that grows under water in shallow zones where light penetrates. Also known as Bay grasses. Substrate - Supporting surface on which a sessile organism lives and grows. The substrate may simply provide structural support, or may provide water and nutrients. A substrate may be inorganic, such as rock or soil, or it may be organic, such as wood. Subtidal - Submerged, not exposed at the lowest tide. Storm Flow - rainfall runoff that reaches a stream channel during, or soon after a rainfall event that causes high rates of discharge. Swamp - a wetland dominated by woodsy vegetation. Swim Bladder - an organ regulating the buoyancy in most bony fishes. TUV Terrestrial - Living on land, as opposed to marine or aquatic. Tides - Periodic movement of water resulting from gravitational attraction between the earth, sun, and moon. Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) - is an estimate of the maximum amount of a given pollutant that a body of water can assimilate without violating water quality standards. This total load includes pollutants that come from the end of a pipe (point source), and from stormwater runoff and ground water flow (nonpoint sources), as 103   well as a ""margin of safety,"" which provides a cushion needed because of uncertainties naturally associated with estimates. A TMDL also may include an allowance for future increases in pollutant loads due to changes in land use, population growth and the expansion of business activities. Toxicant - A poisionous or toxic agent which is harmful to living resources either terrestrial or aquatic. Trend Analysis - a formal statistical process that is used to determine the presence or absence of changes in measures of water quality over time or a geographic area. Tributary - a body of water flowing into a larger body of water. Trophic Level - Layer in the food chain in where one group of organisms serves as the source of nutrition of another group of animals. Turbidity - The decreased clarity in a body of water due to the suspension of silt or sedimentary material. Urban non-point source pollution in the household/home - Defined as pollution that originates from a household/home site, which is difficult to trace to any specific point. Urban non-point source pollution finds its way from diverse residential sources into our land, air, and water. Urban non-point source pollution Area of Focus - The causes and effects of various types of pollution on the environment in an urban setting to include households and home sites under five acres in the local watershed. Vertebrate - Animals with a backbone including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. W Watershed - a region bounded at the periphery by physical barriers that cause water to part and ultimately drain to a particular body of water. Wet Deposition - Atmospheric deposition that occurs when precipitation (rain and snow) carries gases and particles to the earth's surface. Wetland - Low areas such as swamps, tidal flats, and marshes which retain moisture.  104   XYZ Year Class - Most fish species in temperate waters (like those found in the Chesapeake Bay and offshore Virginia) reproduce during a relatively short (one or two month) period each year. That period may be different for each species. Fisheries scientists refer to all of the fish of any species hatched during one annual spawning period as a year class. For mathematical purposes, fishery analysts often treat members of the year class as if all fish were hatched on one day. Young-of-the-year - All of the fish of a species younger than one year of age. Usually scientists assign an arbitrary ""birth date"" to all fish of a species hatched over a two or three month period in one year. The fish are then assigned to Age 1 status on that birth date. By convention, this is usually January 1. Zooplankton - a community of floating, often microscopic animals that inhabit aquatic environments. Unlike phytoplankton , zooplankton cannot produce their own food, and so are consumers.  105"

The Small Business Pollution Compliance Loan Program, which was authorized last year by the General Assembly, is designed to provide financial assistance to small businesses to upgrade or replace equipment to reduce air pollution. The loan program defines a small business as one with 25 or fewer full time employees. The loans may be used for costs in upgrading or replacing air pollution control equipment. The loans also may be used to purchase and install equipment to make operational changes that reduce air pollution and to purchase equipment that modifies production practices to reduce air pollution. Loans of up to $50,000 are available for a project. The interest rate for the loans is based on Marylands General Obligation Bond rate. The length of the loan will depend on the project, but the term can not exceed 15 years. For more information or to request an application package, call the Small Business Assistance Program at (410) 631-3772.

A no discharge zone (NDZ) is an area of water where it is also illegal to discharge sewage that has been treated by a Type I or Type II marine sanitation device (MSD). When operating in an NDZ, Type I and Type II MSDs may not be used and must be secured. NDZs are designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) upon approval of applications submitted by individual states. Although several states have implemented NDZs, there are currently no NDZs in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay or in the Coastal Bays. This will likely change in the future. There have been two Chesapeake Bay Agreements since 1983 that have guided Virginia, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, and Maryland in their efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay. The third Chesapeake Bay Agreement (Chesapeake 2000: A Watershed Partnership), will provide Bay restoration leadership through the year 2010. The Agreement is scheduled to be signed on June 28th, and the draft version includes the following wording: By 2003, establish appropriate areas within the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries as no discharge zones for human waste from boats. By 2010, expand by 50 percent the number and availability of waste pumpout facilities. Maryland is well-positioned to evaluate areas for potential NDZ designation. During the 1999 legislative session, a Maryland law was passed (Natural Resources Article 8-742) that required DNR to, among other things, conduct several surveys that are considered prerequisites to the NDZ application process. DNR was required to identify:  the number, location, and use of pumpouts and waste reception facilities;  the number of recreational vessels in Maryland waters (including transients) that have Type I, Type II, and Type III marine sanitation devices;  areas of water where those boats congregate; and  waters of the State that support living resources that are sensitive to boat sewage discharge using criteria established under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and 40 CFR Section 140-4. In order to help DNR meet these requirements, a Sensitive Areas Committee was formed that includes representatives from the Marine Trades Association of Maryland, Boat/US Clean Water Trust, the Maryland Boat Act Advisory Committee, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), the EPA, and DNR. The Committee helped DNR identify a number of areas that are adequately served by pumpout facilities, that have significant boat congregations, and that contain living resources that are sensitive to boat sewage discharges. From this list, within the next year DNR will recommend a small number of areas to MDE as candidates for pilot NDZs. MDE is the agency responsible for submitting NDZ applications. Then, over time, Maryland will likely pursue NDZ designation for other selected areas.  NO D  ISCHARGE ZONES IN MARYLAND?  Plan from page 1  was gradually crushed and the leak started. When the system was installed about ten years ago, the components were considered state-of-the-art. The transition sump was designed as a model for future marina installations. Fiberglass piping was recommended over galvanized metal. Still, the forces of Mother Nature rule and can ruin an otherwise lovely day. There is one bit of advice that should be heeded by fuel dock owners and operators. Before you have an emergency spill, contact a few Spill Response companies and request their rate sheet. During an emergency you really dont have the luxury of time to call around for competitive quotes. In addition, have your insurance agent review the potential costs associated with a clean up effort. Your policy may not cover, for example, a monitor well with monthly testing . I hope our story serves as food for thought to other facilities as we begin yet another boating season in Maryland. There is no substitute for planning and preparedness when an emergency strikes. If you have a Real Marina Solution you would like to share please contact us. Our contact information is on page 4.  Ceremony from page 1  4) Call upon a mentor or Clean Marina staff member if you have any questions. We can help you find ways to make a no on your Checklist a yes. We can also provide a personal consultation to review your facility, in preparation for your confirmation visit. 5) Schedule a confirmation visit. One member of our staff and one marina operator from our clean marina committee will visit your marina to verify the items checked on the award Checklist. 6) Enjoy your rewards! As a Maryland Clean Marina, you will be authorized to use our logo on your letterhead and in your advertising . You will also receive a certificate, a burgee, and a free page on the Mar yland Clean Marina Initiative website. Additionally, the Initiative will promote your facility through publications, public displays, and media releases. 7) Maintain your Clean Marina status. Annually, confirm in writing that you continue to meet the award standards. At least every third year, we will arrange a meeting to reaffirm Clean Marina status. A goal of the Clean Marina Initiative is to certify 25% (or about 150) of the marinas in the state as clean marinas by 2004. We aim to prove that the marina industry can act voluntarily to reduce pollution from its operations, thereby showing the federal government that voluntary programs, rather than further regulations, are effective in reducing non-point source pollution from this industry. We look forward to celebrating and thanking the operators of our newest certified clean marinas in July.  This spring four marinas were certified as Clean Marinas, meaning they have implemented a significant proportion of the recommendations in the Mar yland Clean Marina Guidebook. Congratulations and thanks to: Youngs Boatyard, Osprey Point Marina, Parkside Marina, and Mears Yacht Haven. Some highlights of the practices these marina operators implemented are:  At Youngs Boatyard in Edgemere customers are asked to implement pollution prevention practices as a condition of their lease agreements. The owner also created a poster of clean boating tips and posted it prominently outside the bath house.  At Osprey Point Marina in Rock Hall employee training is a top priorityeach year management hires a consultant to train employees on OSHA safety and environmental standards.  The owners of Parkside Marina in Baltimore developed an oil spill response plan and invested in a spill response kit even though they do not sell or store fuel. They want to be prepared in case of a spill from any of their slip-holders.  The managers of Mears Yacht Haven in Oxford maintain an oil spill response kit at their fuel dock and have signs conspicuously posted around the property to remind customers about proper waste disposal. All of these marina operators have employed creativity and foresight in implementing best management practices at their facilities.

GX255-05-7836187	"Chapter 4 - Maryland’s NPS Programs and Initiatives       Overview  Nonpoint source pollution (NPS) has emerged as a serious water quality problem that affects all of us. In all major watersheds in Maryland, nonpoint source water pollution occurs to some degree. The sources are related to the various land uses. Analysis of the 1996 land use data indicates that forests/wetlands and agriculture occupy approximately 82 percent of the land area in Maryland. Developed land is the third leading land use accounting for approximately 16 percent.      Chapter Four presents ten source categories of NPS pollution that are of concern to the state. The source categories described are agriculture, forestry, developed lands, marinas and recreational boating, hydromodification, wetlands, septics, mining, atmospheric deposition and groundwater. The following information is included for each source category: Regulatory Programs, Technical Assistance and Incentive Programs, Management Measures - Enforceable Polices and Mechanisms, Five Year Action Strategies and Tracking Measures.      Maryland has been a national leader in developing programs that deal effectively with NPS pollution. A few of the innovative programs include:         Maryland’s Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. The Program, administered in     conjunction with the federal Conservation Reserve Program, provides bonus incentives to     landowners to take sensitive lands out of production and restore wetlands and/or plant     riparian buffers on agricultural lands;          The Department of Natural Resource’s Stream ReLeaf Program. The Program provides     incentives to landowners to plant riparian forest buffers. The Chesapeake Bay Program has     a goal of creating 2,010 miles of buffers by 2010. Maryland’s is working to create     600 miles of buffer; and,            The Department of Natural Resource’s Clean Marinas Program. The Program assists     marina operators to voluntarily implement practices to protect Maryland waterways.      All of the programs described in Chapter Four reflect the public’s concern over the impact that NPS pollution has had on the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays and their tributaries. They are the foundation to controlling and preventing nonpoint source pollution.              Agriculture    Introduction  Maryland agriculture is as diverse as its people. As the state has grown in population, production of traditional commodities such as dairy, grain, and livestock has diversified to take advantage of market proximity. Poultry, tree nurseries, turf production, fresh fruits and vegetables, and racing and pleasure horse industries are now important to Maryland’s agricultural economy.      In 1996, approximately 37 percent of Maryland’s land was used for agricultural purposes. The agriculture industry contributes more than $11 billion in revenue annually, making it the state’s largest commercial industry. With the size of this industry comes the responsibility to farm not only economically but environmentally as well. According to the Chesapeake Bay Program’s Phase IV Watershed Model and Maryland’s Integrated Watershed Analysis and Management System (IWAMS), nonpoint source pollution from agriculture is responsible for 38 percent of the total nitrogen and 55 percent of the total phosphorus entering the bay.      Pursuant to CZARA Section 6217, the agricultural community is currently working to implement the seven agricultural management measures that were developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These management measures are defined as economically achievable measures for the control of the addition of pollutants from existing and new categories and classes of nonpoint sources of pollution, which reflect the greatest degree of pollutant reduction achievable through the application of the best available nonpoint pollution control practices, technologies, processes, siting criteria, operating methods, or other alternatives. Specific information describing how Maryland is addressing these mangement measures can be found in this chapter under the discussion heading Agricultural Management Measures - Enforceable Policies and Mechanisms.    To address nonpoint source pollution, Maryland has numerous agricultural water quality programs and recently passed the most comprehensive farm nutrient control legislation in the country--the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998. Below is a list of agricultural programs implemented by Maryland to help control nonpoint source pollution.    Regulatory Programs    Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998    On May 12, 1998, Maryland’s Governor signed and enacted the Water Quality Improvement Act (WQIA) of 1998. WQIA has been described as the most comprehensive farm nutrient control legislation in the country. The Law provides a framework for a set of regulatory requirements. The details and specifics for the applicable regulations are currently being developed by the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) through the 35 member Nutrient Advisory Committee.    The most far-reaching requirement of the WQIA is that all agricultural operations with gross annual incomes greater than $2,500 or with more than eight animal units (one animal unit equals 1,000 pounds live weight) must have and implement a nitrogen and phosphorus-based nutrient management plan by a prescribed date. The Act requires that anyone ""who, in operating a farm, or uses chemical fertilizer"" must have a nitrogen-and-phosphorus based plan by December 31, 2001, and must implement it by December 31, 2002.    Persons using sludge or animal manure must have and implement nitrogen-based plans by the same dates as those using chemical fertilizers. Those using sludge or animal manure have until July 1, 2004, to submit a nitrogen and phosphorus based nutrient management plan, and must implement it by July 1, 2005.    This legislation applies to all farming operations. This includes poultry and livestock operations, vegetable growers, organic producers, nurseries, greenhouses, turf grass producers, and certain horse farms.    Plans must be developed by a nutrient management consultant certified by MDA. All nutrient management plans developed are subject to the requirements of the WQIA, and all plan revisions must be filed with MDA. MDA is charged with maintaining a copy of each plan for three years. The law recognizes the nutrient management plan as part of a farmer’s business records and protects the confidentiality of the information sent to MDA. Farmers failing to submit a plan by the required deadlines will receive a warning and then a fine of up to $250. Failure to implement a plan in accordance with required deadlines results in a warning and then fines of $100 per violation not to exceed $2000 per farmer per plan per year. Lack of compliance may also result in ineligibility for state agricultural water quality cost share assistance. All penalties collected go to the Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost Share Program.    A person who applies commercial fertilizers for hire or an employee of the owner or manager who applies commercial fertilizers to three or more acres of non-agricultural land or state-owned property must do so in a manner consistent with University of Maryland, Cooperative Extension Service recommendations. MDA will assure compliance by requiring that lawn care companies, public and professional grounds managers and others subject to this law comply with certain record keeping requirements.    Fines for violation of this requirement are up to $1,000 for the first violation, and $2,000 for subsequent violations with up to $10,000 per year for violations associated with ""the same facts and circumstances."" Willfulness, recurrence, impact on humans or the environment, and availability of technology are considered in assessing fines. Each day is a separate violation and penalties go to the state general fund.    Poultry integrators are also affected by WQIA. By December 31, 2000, all contract feed for chickens must include phytase or some other enzyme or additive that reduces phosphorus. Additionally, state funding to transport poultry litter to areas where nutrients can be more effectively utilized is provided if matched by the poultry companies.    As a result of WQIA, several new programs are being developed:         Poultry Litter Transportation Pilot Program,     Manure Matching Service,     Animal Waste Technology Fund,     Tax Credit for Fertilizer Source Changes,     Tax Subtraction for Purchase of Manure/Litter Spreading Equipment,     Nutrient Reduction Research Grant; and,          Lead Agency:   Maryland Department of Agriculture        Erosion and Sediment Control    MDE is responsible for enforcing the law restricting agricultural sediment and erosion (MD. CODE ANN., ENVIR. 4-413). Under this law, farmers must carry out corrective actions to address pollution caused by erosion problems as recommended by the local SCD. The law defines the discharge of sediment to include ""placing the sediment in a location where it is likely to pollute."" Farmers conducting agricultural activities under a SCD-approved SCWQ plan are exempt from penalty but must correct any identified problems. The regulations were promulgated in 1994. These regulations set forth the manner in which the agricultural agencies and MDE will cooperate to seek corrective actions. When a sediment problem is reported, MDE may inspect the site along with a SCD representative or investigate independently to determine the appropriate actions.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Environment and Maryland Department of   Agriculture      Confined Animal Facilities (Large and Small Unit)    MDE has the enforcement authority to take action against individuals who discharge any pollutant into the waters of the state (MD. CODE ANN., ENVIR. 9-322). Discharge is defined in the statute to include the ""placing of a pollutant in a place where the pollutant is likely to pollute"" (9-101). This statute applies to agricultural operations where facility wastewater or runoff from confined animal facilities causes a pollution problem. If cooperation is not forthcoming or if the violation poses an immediate threat to public safety and health, the MDE may issue fines and seek court-enforced actions.    In some instances, local governments may add their own requirements. A zoning ordinance in Kent County, pertaining to all new animal operations, requires nutrient management plans and regulates the distance that animal facilities must be from floodplains and property lines.    MDE also has the authority to issue wastewater discharge permits (MD. CODE ANN., ENVIR. 9-323). The department issues permits to confined animal facilities as defined in criteria established under an interagency Memorandum of Understanding. Permits require the application of NRCS standards and compliance with a nutrient management plan. The agreement between state and federal agencies outlines guidelines for the cooperative exchange of information and technical knowledge and sets procedures for a site review of animal waste storage structures which are not subject to discharge regulations.          Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture      Pesticide Management    MDA has the authority to assess civil penalties, revoke or suspend licenses and certificates, or refer federal violations to EPA for appropriate enforcement action for misuse of pesticides. Field inspectors conduct routine business inspections and investigate consumer complaints and pesticide incidents. MDA promotes activities to create a well-informed regulated community to improve compliance with the laws and regulations. Outreach and communication is an important component of the regulatory program.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture      Irrigation Water Management    Nonpoint sources of pollution from irrigation do not and are not reasonably expected to present significant adverse effects to living coastal resources or human health in Maryland. Accurate measurement of soil water depletion volume and volume of water applied to crops is collected by the Maryland Cooperative Extension (CE), the timing and amount of water applied to cropland in Maryland is generally below maximum potential crop needs. For general crops, CE recommends that farmers use sprinkler systems. Sprinkler systems are designed to apply water evenly over an area at a rate that will not cause water runoff or produce excessive deep percolation in the soil. Agricultural irrigation systems that remove more than 10,000 gallons/day are required to apply for a Water Appropriation and Use Permit from MDE.    Maryland has a humid climate and typically water is readily available from rain. Therefore, irrigation systems are designed to correspond directly to meeting minimum water needs because of economic constraints. Because of this, many systems are unable to maintain predicted peak evapotranspiration over an extended drought.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of the Environment - Water Use Program      Nontidal Wetlands Program      The Nontidal Wetlands Program requires landowners engaged in agricultural activities that adversely impact nontidal wetlands to implement BMPs through a soil conservation and water quality plan (SCWQP). The law states that the intent of the BMPs will include control of soil loss and minimization of sediment deposition in nontidal wetlands and minimization of water quality degradation, adverse impacts to the surface water and groundwater circulation patterns, and adverse impacts to the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of nontidal wetlands. Practices may include conservation tillage and filter strips. See the Wetlands and Waterways Programs subchapter for more information on the Nontidal Wetlands Program.          Lead Agency: Soil Conservation Districts and Maryland Department of the Environment      Chesapeake Bay Critical Areas Program    The Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Program requires all agricultural land in the Critical Area to have a SCWQ plan. Although not mandated, SCWQ planning is typically done on the entire farm, rather than restricted to the 1000-foot Critical Area. Since farm property boundaries generally exceed the Critical Area boundary, a much higher percentage of farm land is planned than is required. Soil Conservation Districts (SCDs) develop and approve SCWQPs under mandated local protection programs to assure that all agricultural activities within the Critical Area use BMPs to control nutrient runoff. They must assure that animal feeding operations (including retention and storage ponds, feed lot waste storage, and manure storage) minimize the contamination of water bodies. The SCWQ plans must also address nutrient management in the critical area.      The Critical Area Program requires a 25-foot vegetated filter strip be established on agricultural land along tidal waters, wetlands, or tributary streams or BMPs to achieve equivalent water quality benefits and habitat protection. This buffer must be maintained unless the landowner is implementing a program of BMPs. The feeding or watering of livestock is not be permitted within 50 feet of tidal water, wetlands or tributaries. The grazing of livestock may not disturb stream banks, tidal shorelines, or habitat protection areas such as threatened or endangered species habitat, natural heritage areas, or habitat of local significance.          Lead Agency: Local Soil Conservation Districts      Technical Assistance and Incentive Programs    Poultry Litter Transportation Pilot Program    The Poultry Litter Transportation Pilot Program is a joint project between the state and poultry companies. It will provide cost-share--up to $20 per ton--to offset the cost of transportation and handling of poultry litter from farms with excess litter or with phosphorus over-enriched land. Poultry farms anywhere in Maryland are eligible for the program, but the goal is to relocate 20 percent of the poultry litter produced by Maryland’s four lower Eastern Shore counties.    Litter must be transported for use on land having the capacity to hold additional phosphorus. Cost-share can also be obtained for transport to sites for other environmentally acceptable uses such as composting, co-generation of power, or manufacture of new products.    The state has allocated $750,000 for this project in fiscal year 1999 and has contracts from poultry companies matching that amount. The state is committed to match funds provided by poultry companies during the four year pilot.      Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture    Manure Matching Service    Another program initiated through the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998, is the Manure Matching Service. MDA will provide a service to link farmers with excess manure with other farmers who can use it as a nutrient source. This service will build upon the existing Delmarva Poultry Industry Program and support the pilot transport program.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture      Animal Waste Technology Fund    Also a part of the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998, the Animal Waste Technology Fund was authorized and funded. This fund was established within the Department of Business and Economic Development to provide support for research and development of technologies to reduce nutrient content of animal waste, alter the composition of animal waste, or develop alternative animal waste utilization processes. The fund can provide grants, loans, loan guarantees, or equity investments.      Eligible projects must have a strong potential to improve public health and the environment, preserve the viability of agriculture, and have a positive economic impact in the State. Funding will be competitive, based on the above considerations. $1.3 million has been allocated to the fund for SFY99, with $350,000 targeted to support the addition of the phytase enzyme to feed.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture and Department of Business and Economic   Development      Tax Credit for Fertilizer Source Changes    Some farmers may have to reduce or eliminate their use of animal manures as a fertilizer source to comply with phosphorus based nutrient management plans and will have to purchase commercial fertilizer to meet crop nitrogen needs.    The WQIA allows for a State income tax credit equal to 50 percent of the additional cost of fertilizer up to $4,500 per year for up to three consecutive years. Individuals and corporations are eligible for the credit starting in tax year 1999. If the credit exceeds the total tax liability for the year, the excess may be applied to subsequent tax years until the excess is used, or by the fifth succeeding tax year. The credit must be used by the end of tax year 2008.          Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture      Tax Subtraction for Purchase of Manure/Litter Spreading Equipment    A person who purchases equipment to spread poultry litter with the capacity of being calibrated to 1 ton per acre, or to spread solid or liquid livestock waste in accordance with a nutrient management plan, may subtract 100 percent of the purchase price from their State adjusted gross income. The person must have purchased the equipment during tax year 1998 or later and must own the equipment for at least 3 years after the tax year in which the deduction is made. If the deduction exceeds the Maryland taxable income prior to the deduction, the excess may be carried over for up to 5 succeeding tax years. This subtraction is modeled on the current tax subtraction for conservation tillage equipment.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture      Technical Assistance/Field Staff    The state recognized the importance of nutrient management planning and the implementation of agriculture BMPs in abating NPS pollution. In order to provide the technical assistance necessary to initiate the planning and design of BMPs the state legislature has supported the enhancement of technical staff in Soil Conservation District offices. These technical positions assist with the design and implementation of complementary practices such as waste storage, farm yard management, heavy use area protection, alternative livestock watering, stream protection, and pasture management. In state fiscal year 1999, 15 additional positions were funded and another 33 in the fiscal year 2000 budget.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture      Nutrient Reduction Research Grants    The Governor has committed $800,000 per year for at least 3 years for agricultural research and education programs to expedite implementation of technologies that will help farmers meet the WQIA requirements. The 1999 funding will support research on composting, animal nutrition management, development of a phosphorus index, phosphorus dynamics in soils, and nutrient reduction in nursery and greenhouse systems. The Nutrient Reduction Oversight Committee, a cabinet level group, will oversee use of the research funds.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of the Environment      Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Program    The Maryland General Assembly established the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Program in 1977 which is administered by the Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation. The Foundation is governed by Agricultural Article Sections 2-501 through 2-515 of the Annotated Code of Maryland. The mission of the program is to preserve productive agricultural land and woodland that can provide continued production of food and fiber for present and future citizens of the state. Additional benefits of this program are that it limits urban sprawl, protects wildlife and wildlife habitat, and preserves the environment and water quality of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. This preservation program is the most successful of its kind in the nation; it has preserved more farmland than in any other of the 49 states.      To become eligible for the Agricultural Land Preservation Program, a landowner must meet certain requirements. The property to be preserved must be located in an Agricultural Land Preservation District. A district has to have at least 100 contiguous acres of farmland or woodland with at least 50 percent of the soils classified as USDA soil capability class I, II, or III and/or a woodland group of I or II. See table 4.1. The landowner must sign a voluntary agreement stating that the land in the district will be kept in agricultural land use for at least five years. The land owner can not subdivide the property for residential, commercial or industrial land use while in district status. Once accepted into an Agricultural Land Preservation District, the landowner can submit an application to sell an agricultural land preservation easement to the state through the Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation. See table 4.2.      In 1997, the Foundation approved 154 new Preservation Districts enrolling approximately 18,575 acres. As of June 30, 1997, 2,277 districts were enrolled in the preservation program, constituting 303,286 acres. The Foundation approved offers from 88 landowners for permanent easements and of those 84 accepted. The Foundation purchased easements on 968 properties as of June 30, 1997 which permanently protected 139,828 acres of agricultural land.

Source: Maryland Agricultural 1997 Annual Report          Lead Agency: Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation      Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Share Program (MACS)    The Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost Share Program (MACS) was established in 1983 to help farmers pay the cost of installing best management practices that protect water quality. In 1999, Maryland’s 24 soil conservation districts helped farmers in Maryland secure $4.6 million through the MACS Program. This $4.6 million was used to install over 900 water quality protection projects which represented a total personal investment of an additional $1.2 million by Maryland farmers. This effort has prevented approximately 35,000 tons of soil from reaching Maryland’s waterways and managed 1,700 tons of animal waste more efficiently.    The MACS Program provides up to 87.5% of the cost of installing eligible BMPs for animal waste structures, not to exceed $75,000 per project and a total of $100,000 per farm. For all other BMPs installed the cost share is not to exceed $20,000 per project or $50,000 per farm and up to $40,000 per project under a combined agreement targeting a pollution control problem on two or more farms. Twenty-seven best management practices (BMPs) are eligible for the MACS Program. A few examples follow:         Animal waste management systems,     Contour farming,     Critical area plantings,     Poultry mortality composting facilities,     Diversions,     Riparian buffers,     Grade stabilization structures,     Grass waterways,     Cover crops,     Stream Fencing,     Heavy use area protection,     Roof runoff management, and     Stream crossings.          Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture      Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP)    Maryland’s Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program is administered in conjunction with the federal Conservation Reserve Program. The purpose of the program is to improve the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay and other specified bodies of water by encouraging owners of certain eligible farmland to enroll in the program, which provides annual rental to owners who agree to adopt certain conservation practices on land instead of actively farming it. The state Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program provides bonus incentives to landowners to take sensitive lands out of production and restore wetlands and/or plant riparian buffers on agricultural lands. This new federal-state initiative is designed to make streamside conservation measures a practical alternative for many farmers. It improves upon USDA’s CRP by offering farmers greater incentives to voluntarily convert environmentally sensitive cropland into riparian forest or vegetative buffers and wetlands. The program also provides for long-term protection of resources that would not be possible under the old CRP. Landowners have the option to sell permanent easements through Maryland’s Open Space Program, Rural Legacy, or the Agriculture Land Preservation Program. Landowners can sign up for CREP any time at their local Soil Conservation District or Farm Service Agency. To be eligible for CREP , farmers must meet one of the following requirements:         Cropland that has been planted to an agricultural commodity for 2 of the last 5 years,     and is still physically and legally capable of being so planted, or     Marginal pasture land suitable for use as a riparian forest buffer.      CREP funding exists to restore up to 100,000 acres of environmentally sensitive cropland and streamside properties. The program’s enrollment targets are:         70,000 acres of riparian forest or vegetative buffers,     20,000 acres of highly erodible lands; and,     10,000 acres of wetlands.          Lead Agencies: Maryland Department of Agriculture, USDA Farm Service Agency, and the   Natural Resources Conservation Service      Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)    The Environmental Quality Incentives Program provides technical, educational, and financial assistance to eligible farmers and ranchers to address soil, water, and related natural resource concerns on their lands in an environmentally beneficial and cost-effective manner. The program assists farmers and ranchers in complying with federal and state environmental laws while encouraging environmental enhancement. The program is funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation. Program goals are achieved through a conservation plan which includes structural, vegetative, and land management practices on eligible land. Cost-share payments may be made to implement one or more eligible structural or vegetative practices such as animal waste management facilities, terraces, filter strips, tree planting, and permanent wildlife habitat. Incentive payments can be made to implement one or more land management practices such as nutrient, pest, and grazing land management.      For a detailed description of this program please see Chapter 5 - Public Education, Outreach and Assistance Programs.          Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture USDA Service Center       Cover Crop Program    MDA administered a four-year pilot program to promote the use of cover crops to capture unused nitrogen during the fall and winter. Due to the 1997 drought and concerns raised by Pfisteria outbreaks on the lower Eastern Shore, an emergency allocation of $2 million was provided to continue funding of this statewide program. In 1998, the program received $1.5 million but participation was limited to the nine Eastern Shore counties. Sixty seven thousand acres were initially enrolled, however payment was made only to those applicants meeting program guidelines, this reduced the total acreage paid for to 50,105 acres. In state fiscal year 1999, $1.5 million was allocated for the same nine counties with sign-up in July.    MDA has also secured EPA, Clean Water Action Plan (CWAP) funds to support a cover crop program in the Monocacy, Antietam, and Catoctin creek watersheds in the Piedmont. During the first three days of sign-up, the allocation of $400,000 was exhausted.    Drought conditions caused the state to provide a $3 million emergency allocation which supported cover crop establishment statewide. Approximately 250,000 acres have been enrolled in 1999.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture      Note: There are an additional 13 programs that will provide cost-share for various BMPs and habitat enhancement projects on agricultural land. These incentive based programs are offered by federal, state and nonprofit organizations to private landowners to encourage land stewardship. Program descriptions are found in the Financial Assistance section of this document.    Agricultural Water Management Program    The mission of the Agricultural Water Management Program is to prevent pollution and protect water resources by ensuring the review and approval of local public drainage associations and the operation and maintenance plans for drainage systems. The goal of these plans is to continue to provide adequate drainage on agricultural lands while ensuring water quality protection.      In 1997, technical assistance was provided for some 850 miles of public drainage ditches. Approximately 62,225 acres of cropland benefit from public drainage facilities in Maryland. Although MDA is authorized to provide up to 50 percent of the maintenance costs, state funding from this program has not been provided since 1995. In 1999 EPA grant funds of $275,000 dollars supported innovative management practices such as pocket wetlands and water control structures.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture      Nutrient Management Program    Maryland’s Nutrient Management Program helps farmers utilize all nutrient sources including commercial fertilizers, sewage sludge, and animal waste. A Nutrient Management Plan(NMP) is a written site specific plan indicating how the major plant nutrients--nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium--are to be managed for expected crop production and water quality protection. The elements of a standard nutrient management plan include:         Information to identify farm location, watershed code, field acreage, operator’s     name and address, and preparer’s identification and certification;     Crop history yields, soil and manure test results, and credits for residual nitrogen     from previous crops;     Nutrient recommendations by field;       Information on update requirements, any special environmental recommendations, and the     proper management and utilization of manure; and ,     Map or site plan of acreage covered.      MDA regulates public and private nutrient management consultants, who provide technical assistance for plan development, through Maryland’s Nutrient Management Certification and Licensing Program. The purpose of this certification and licensing program is to test the competence of the nutrient management consultants in writing state approved crop nutrient recommendations. Required continuing education courses are designed to provide greater detail about nutrient management concepts and their practical applications. Certified individuals are updated on the latest relevant research findings and technologies and kept up-to-date with program policies and strategies. Nutrient Management Certification is required for all individuals who provide recommendations to farmers on the use and management of crop nutrients. Core knowledge area components for training and certification include general nutrient management, crop production, agricultural and environmental management, basic soil science, nutrient sampling testing and analysis, basic soil fertility, management of commercial fertilizers, manure and biosolids, and state incentives and regulations. The total number of certified nutrient management consultants in 1999 reached 500.    In 1999, Maryland Cooperative Extension Service consultants and private industry consultants developed new nutrient management plans for 115,000 acres. The total cropland area managed under the Nutrient Management Program is over 1.2 million acres, reaching the tributary strategy goal of implementing nutrient management plans on 1.2 million acres by the year 2000.      With enactment of the Water Quality Improvement Act nutrient management plans become mandatory on most agricultural land beginning in 2002. The necessity of implementing this program as a regulatory requirement has changed the traditional role of outreach, education, and technical assistance promoted by MDA since the program initiation. MDA nutrient management staff will be expanded from 3 to 17. Nutrient management specialists in 6 regional offices will be responsible for verifying that certified consultants are following technical standards and criteria set forth for nutrient management plans in regulations and that farmers are implementing nutrient management plans in accordance with the regulation. Farmers who apply nutrients to 10 or more acres will also have to participate in two hours of training every three years and obtain a voucher from MDA.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture      Integrated Pest Management Program    Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an effective and environmentally sound approach to pest management. It relies on the use of pest scouting, environmental information, and a variety of pest management methods to prevent unacceptable levels of pest damage. Unlike any single method of pest control, IPM programs balance costs, benefits, public health and environmental quality, and avoid unnecessary applications of pesticides. This is accomplished by focusing on correcting conditions that encourage pests such as reducing the amount of food, water, and shelter available to pests. Practices such as sanitation, excluding pests through structural repairs, and scouting to determine pest levels comprise the routine IMP service, as well as the use where needed of pesticides. These practices can achieve an effective long term pest control program. The basic components of IPM are:         Monitoring     Sanitation/structural repairs     Communication     Record keeping     Pest control without pesticides     Pest control with pesticides     Program evaluation       Quality assurance.      MDA has regulatory requirements and enforcement mechanisms for both general use and restricted use pesticides applied by any applicator in Maryland. Maryland Pesticide Applicators Law and Regulations gives state authority to MDA to enforce pesticide regulations within Maryland. Under state law, each pesticide must be used according to the label directions. The state’s lead agency for the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) in Maryland, MDA must ensure that all pesticides are used according to their label directions by all individuals, through compliance monitoring activities (routine inspections, use observations, and incident and misuse complaints).      A licensed company or public agency must register each employee who performs pest control with MDA. Each registered employee is trained in all aspects of pesticide application including pesticide handling and storage and must attend ongoing educational classes to retain their license.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture      Agricultural Unusable Pesticide Disposal Program    In 1994, MDA developed a pilot program to collect and dispose of unusable pesticides from private producers in three counties. This program helps prevent potential point source contamination by removing unusable pesticides from storage areas. The state expanded this program to additional counties in subsequent years to eventually provide statewide coverage. Due to limited participation in SFY2000, an evaluation of this program will take place.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture      Maryland Organic Certification Program    Organic agriculture refers to a specific type of agricultural systems used to produce food and fiber. Simply put, organic farming systems do not use chemical pesticides or fertilizers. Instead, they are based on the development of biological diversity and the maintenance and replenishment of soil fertility. Certified organic farms produce agricultural products that have been grown and processed according to strict uniform standards, verified annually by an independent state or private organization. Organic farming addresses the control or reduction of nonpoint source pollution because the practices implemented emphasize resource sustainability and protection.    The number of Maryland farmers participating in the Maryland Organic Certification Program increased for the eighth consecutive year in 1998. Fifty-five Maryland farms were issued organic certificates by the Secretary of Agriculture, representing an increase of forty-nine Maryland farms participating in the program since its inception in 1991. The average farm size has increased from 50 acres in 1997 to nearly 60 acres in 1998 as larger farm operations (e.g., grain operations) are becoming involved in organic production. Inquiries about organic production and the organic certification program from farmers and other agribusinesses continues to increase. This growth in the certification program is a result of an increasing number of Maryland consumers seeking alternative food sources in addition to traditional Maryland agricultural products.      Throughout 1998, the Maryland Organic Certification Program facilitated the development of the organic industry in Maryland. Promotion of the Maryland organic industry took place at the MDA Open House, the State Fair in Timonium, and at the Restaurant Association of Maryland Trade Show. Information on certification services was presented to national retailers and wholesalers attending the Natural Products Expo East Trade Show in Baltimore. Two Japanese delegations visited the MDA and were briefed on the Maryland Organic Certification Program and organic products produced in Maryland.      The program established outreach programs with the USDA, Beltsville Agriculture Research Center (BARC) to facilitate the development of organic research at the facility. MDA also participated in a workshop on organic research and marketing sponsored by the USDA Economic Research Service. Interaction continued with the USDA Foreign Agriculture Service (FAS) on organic certification procedures and the development of trade contacts. MDA maintained its non-voting membership in the Organic Trade Association (OTA) and participated at the OTA annual meetings in Baltimore.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture    Future Harvest in Maryland    The Future Harvest Project was established in 1994 to bring together a diverse set of collaborators in Maryland and Delaware to promote understanding and interest in sustainable agriculture. The focus of the project is to encourage farmers to adopt production practices which work with and are strengthened by the currents of nature. Traditional farms often use expensive and potentially damaging commercial fertilizers and pesticides. The project is working to develop marketing strategies which allow consumers to directly support sustainable farmers, making sustainable farming attractive so that more farmers are encouraged to reduce their dependence on chemical use.      Project collaborators include environmentalists, researchers, extension agents, and a broad spectrum of farmers- from organic to conventional, and from small acreage vegetable growers to thousand-acre cash grain producers. The project has received major support from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation which provided a four-year grant to initiate the effort. One of the elements of the project which interested the foundation was the very broad philosophical diversity within the project community. Kellogg was specifically interested in how such varied interests can effectively coalesce and change the agriculture of a region such as the Chesapeake Bay, with its substantial water quality concerns.    The major elements of the project included three farm boards, consisting of ten farmers each, that use on-farm demonstrations of sustainable agriculture practices. The Farmer to Farmer Network puts growers with interests in sustainable agriculture in contact with farmers in their own communities who are using such practices. The Revolving Loan Fund works with county Soil Conservation Districts and local banks to provide low interest loans to farmers to fund sustainable changes to their operations. The Poultry Project works with university researchers, poultry growers, and the poultry industry to advance the science and marketing of composted poultry manure. The Sustainable Agriculture Resource Center serves as a local clearinghouse for sustainable agriculture information. The Future Harvest Project Newsletter is the major ""voice"" of sustainable agriculture in the region. The Future Harvest Festival brings farmers and consumers together to share experiences and learn how both groups can provide for and support one another. Lastly, the Chesapeake Farms for the Future Board has brought together a group of farmers and agriculture land preservation experts to advance the concept of ""strategic"" farmland preservation.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Agriculture      Maryland’s Center for Agroecology    The College of Agriculture and Natural Resources is creating a ""center for agroecology"" that will have a very strong sustainable agriculture focus. The current plans for this center are to embrace the concepts of land ethics as espoused by Aldo Leopold; the center will be modeled after the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture in Iowa.    The center is now in its formative stages. A focus group meeting with state leaders was held in mid-June 1999 and recommendations will be made over the summer based on the group’s discussions.    Researchers feel that certain barriers hinder the adoption of sustainable agriculture, including high transition cost for farmers; insufficient markets and services; lack of public awareness, importance, and support; and the absence of effective strategies for instituting sustainable agriculture.          Lead Agency: University of Maryland      Agriculture Management Measures - Enforceable Policies and Mechanisms    Pursuant to CZARA Section 6217, the agriculture community is currently working to implement the seven management measures described below. The following section identifies: 1) the required management measures as developed by EPA and NOAA; 2) a description of how they apply to Maryland’s agricultural industry; and, 3) a table listing Maryland’s enforceable polices and mechanisms used to address the federal requirements.    The final section in this chapter contains a Five-Year Action Plan (1998 - 2002) that describes what actions the state is taking over the next 5 years to implement and track management measures.                            Table 4.3: Management Measure - Erosion and Sediment Control                Erosion and Sediment Control               Apply the erosion component of a Conservation Management     System (CMS) as defined in the Field Office Technical Guide of the U.S. Department of     Agriculture - Soil Conservation Service to minimize the delivery of sediment from     agricultural lands to surface waters, or Design and install a combination of management     and physical practices to settle the settleable solids and associated pollutants in runoff     delivered from the contributing area for storms of up to and including a 10-year, 24-hour     frequency.

Note: This measure applies to all existing facilities which meet the size criteria in the federal guidance and to all new operations  regardless of size.  In Maryland, the Soil Conservation Districts (SCDs) work with any landowner regardless of the size of the facility. However, for practical reasons, the state generally defines an agricultural unit or operation as either 5 animals or 10 acres of cropland, pastureland, hayland or combination land or tobacco that is raised and sold. According to Maryland's agricultural unit definition, if a farmer has, for example, a confined animal operation with 10,000 chickens on 4 acres, the operation is considered an agricultural operation.

Table 4.8: Management Measure - Nutrient Management                Nutrient Management               Develop, implement, and periodically update a nutrient     management plan to: (1) apply nutrients at rates necessary to achieve realistic crop     yields, (2) improve the timing of nutrient application, and (3) use agronomic crop     production technology to increase nutrient use efficiency. When the source of the     nutrients is other than commercial fertilizer, determine the nutrient value and the rate     of availability of the nutrients. Determine and credit the nitrogen contribution of any     legume crop. Soil and plant tissue testing should be used routinely. Nutrient management     plans contain the following core components: (1) Farm and field maps showing acreage,     crops, soils, and waterbodies.       (2) Realistic yield expectations for the crop(s) to be grown, based primarily on the     producer's actual yield history, State Land Grant University yield expectations for the     soil series, or SCS Soils-5 information for the soil series.       (3) A summary of the nutrient resources available to the producer, which at a minimum     include:               ! Soil test results for pH, phosphorus,       nitrogen, and potassium;         ! Nutrient analysis of manure, sludge,       mortality compost (birds, pigs, etc.), or effluent (if applicable);         ! Nitrogen contribution to the soil from       legumes grown in the rotation (if applicable); and         ! Other significant nutrient sources (e.g.,       irrigation water).             (4) An evaluation of field limitations based on environmental hazards or concerns, such     as:               ! Sinkholes, shallow soils over fractured       bedrock, and soils with high leaching potential,         ! Lands near surface water,         ! Highly erodible soils, and         ! Shallow aquifers.             (5) Use of the limiting nutrient concept to establish the mix of nutrient sources and     requirements for the crop based on a realistic yield expectation.       (6) Identification of timing and application methods for nutrients to: provide     nutrients at rates necessary to achieve realistic crop yields; reduce losses to the     environment; and avoid applications as much as possible to frozen soil and during periods     of leaching or runoff.       (7) Provisions for the proper calibration and operation of nutrient application                              Note: This measure applies to the application of nutrients to agricultural land.

In addition, see the  Confined     Animal Facility  management measure, the state’s general water quality authority     MD. CODE ANN., ENVIR. 9-322 serves as back-up authority.            Table 4.14: Management Measure - Irrigation Water Management                Irrigation Water     Management               To reduce nonpoint source pollution of surface waters     caused by irrigation: (1) Operate the irrigation system so that the timing and amount of     irrigation water applied match crop water needs. This will require, as a minimum: (a) the     accurate measurement of soil-water depletion volume and the volume of irrigation water     applied, and (b) uniform application of water.       (2) When chemigation is used, include backflow preventers for wells, minimize the     harmful amounts of chemigated waters that discharge from the edge of the field, and     control deep percolation. In cases where chemigation is performed with furrow irrigation     systems, a tailwater management system may be needed.       The following limitations and special conditions apply:       (1) In some locations, irrigation return flows are subject to other water rights or are     required to maintain stream flow. In these special cases, on-site reuse could be precluded     and would not be considered part of the management measure for such locations.       (2) By increasing the water use efficiency, the discharge volume from the system will     usually be reduced. While the total pollutant load may be reduced somewhat, there is the     potential for an increase in the concentration of pollutants in the discharge. In these     special cases, where living resources or human health may be adversely affected and where     other management measures (nutrients and pesticides) do not reduce concentrations in the     discharge, increasing water use efficiency would not be considered part of the management     measure.       (3) In some irrigation districts, the time interval between the order for and the     delivery of irrigation water to the farm may limit the irrigator's ability to achieve the     maximum on-farm application efficiencies that are otherwise possible.       (4) In some locations, leaching is necessary to control salt in the soil profile.     Leaching for salt control should be limited to the leaching requirement for the root zone.       (5) Where leakage from delivery systems or return flows supports wetlands or wildlife     refuges, it may be preferable to modify the system to achieve a high level of efficiency     and then divert the ""saved water"" to the wetland or wildlife refuge. This will     improve the quality of water delivered to wetlands or wildlife refuges by preventing the     introduction of pollutants from irrigated lands to such diverted water.       (6) In some locations, sprinkler irrigation is used for frost or freeze protection, or     for crop cooling. In these special cases, applications should be limited to the amount     necessary for crop protection, and applied water should remain on-site.               Note: Nonpoint sources of pollution from irrigation do not and are not reasonably expected to present significant adverse effects to living coastal resources or human health in Maryland.

Nutrient Management Plans        Nutrient management plans are presently tracked by number and acres by   county in accordance with reports filed annually by licensed nutrient management   consultants. Beginning December 31, 2001 all farms will be required to provide MDA   documentation of the development of a nutrient management plan. This will be entered into   a database and may be provided as acres managed under a nutrient management plan by   watershed. Farmer specific information is required to be maintained confidentially by law.      Large / Small Confined Animal feeding Operations        Large confined animal feeding operations will be tracked under permit   by MDE and BMP and nutrient mangement implementation will be part of the database as   discribed for nutrient management plans. Implementation of management measures for small   confined animal feeding operations will be contained in the SCWQ and nutrient management   plan databases.                 Pesticide        Pesticide management tracking is kept in a database indicating   individuals with licenses to apply pesticides.      Please see Appendix 4 for additional agricultural tracking information.      Forestry    Introduction  Forests are widely recognized as one of the land uses that provides the greatest protection for water quality and aquatic and wildlife habitat. As such, efforts to restore and conserve forests are an important part of nonpoint source pollution control.      In 1634, nearly all of Maryland was forested. Very little vegetation grew under the age old trees. One of the settlers wrote this description of Maryland:        ""Fine groves of trees appear, not choked with briers or bushes and   undergrowth, but growing at intervals as if planted by the hand of man, so that you can   drive a four horse carriage, wherever you choose, through the midst of the trees""   (Andrew Matthew Page, History of Maryland, 1929).      Hardwoods and mixed pine-hardwoods predominated, and the forests contained extensive stands of oak and hickory. In western Maryland, endless waves of American chestnut and white pine covered the ridges of the Appalachians. Oak, walnut, poplar, locust, hickory and cucumber trees grew in the bottomlands. To grow their crops, settlers cleared the land of timber, which had no market value. Using the most efficient method they had, the settlers destroyed vast areas of forest by burning or girdling (removing a band of bark from the circumference of a tree).    Initially, the supply of wood obtained from clearing land exceeded the settlers’ needs for timber. As the population grew, however, this source no longer met the demand, and in the 1800's the exploitation of timber began. A ""cut and get out"" philosophy was the order of the day. At first, the loggers cut only the choice trees and left those of poorer quality. But as a changing market made their harvesting economically feasible, even the inferior trees were logged. No effort was made to regenerate the depleted areas, and forest fires were frequent. Believing the myth of ""superabundance,"" the loggers simply moved on to untouched forest.    By the late 1800's , the nation grew concerned about the abuse of its forest resources, and their protection and management became a politically popular issue. Gifford Pichot, the ""father of American forestry"" and one of Theodore Roosevelt’s chief advisors, promoted the concept of wise use and sustained yield of forest. Aware of the need for conserving Maryland’s forest, John and Robert Garrett of Baltimore offered 2,000 acres of woodland to the state in 1906. The bequest was contingent upon the organization of a state forestry department to manage the land.    Maryland’s First Forestry Law    As a direct result of the Garrett’s generous and farsighted gift, the legislature passed Maryland’s first forestry law. It dealt mainly with the control of the forest fires which made the practice of forestry financially impractical. Specifically, the law called for the establishment of a State Board of Forestry, the appointment of a State Forester and the organization of a corps of local fire wardens. The law also provided for education of woodlot owners about better management and harvesting methods. The Forestry Board’s total operating budget in 1906 was $2,500.    The establishment of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1933 boosted Maryland’s forestry substantially. The CCC not only fought fires but also built cabins and other structures on state forest land and initiated many reforestation projects. By the 1940's, the risk of forest fire to Maryland’s timber growing business had been greatly reduced.      Maryland’s Forestry Conservancy District Act of 1943 was one of the most progressive forestry laws in the nation. The act stated, ""It is...the policy of the state to encourage economic management and scientific development of its woodlands to maintain, conserve, and improve soil resources of the State to the end that an adequate source of forest products be preserved for the people...where such interests can be served through cooperative efforts of private forest landowners, with the assistance of the State, it is to be the policy of the state to encourage, assist and guide private ownership in the management and fullest economic development of such privately owned forest lands."" As a result of the legislation, scientific forestry principles were applied to all types of privately owned forest land in the state.    Multiple Use Management    In the 1950's and 1960's more and more people began to visit Maryland’s forests. The general public, as well as the professional forester, recognized the fact that forests were valuable for reasons other than simply supplying timber. The philosophy of multiple use management began to evolve, and the passage of federal legislation made it the cornerstone of forest management throughout the country. Management of Maryland’s state forests expanded to encompass outdoor recreation, wildlife, fish, and water, as well as fiber production.    During the 1970's and the 1980's state managers began to coordinate their multiple use management practices more effectively with potential environmental, economic, and social impacts. A system evolved for intensive long-range planning for forest service management. Now the Maryland Forest Service inventories and closely examines the supply and demand for all forest resources. More attention is given to collecting data and to planning programs, legislation and activities that involve the public in forestry affairs.    Maryland Forest Today    Today, forests cover about 2.7 million acres of Maryland representing 40 percent of the state’s total land area. Of this total, 2.4 million acres (90 percent) are classified as timberland. Timberland is defined as land growing at least 20 cubic feet (or the equivalent of twenty-four 2""x4""x8' framing studs) of wood on every acre each year with the potential of harvesting it. Examples of areas not classified as timberland include federal and state park land, Christmas tree farms, and forest set aside for scientific study.      Maryland’s forests make a very direct and visible contribution to our economy. Every year, Maryland households spend over $454,000,000 on the many products produced from trees. Furniture alone accounts $170,000,000. Wages and salaries of individuals involved in the manufacture of goods and services in the wood industry amount to $327,840,000 annually. Indirect business taxes add up to $21,314,000 each year. The pulp and paper products industry alone employs 9300 people across the state.      As Maryland’s population continues to grow and creates the need for additional development, Maryland will continue losing forest. Projections by the Maryland Office of Planning estimate that between 1990 and 2015, the area dominated by urban development will increase to 1.5 million acres. However, large-scale conversion of forests to developed land is not the only threat to Maryland’s forests. Fragmentation, insects, disease, and exotic invasive plants, along with remote factors such as air pollution and acid deposition, have impacted the health of Maryland’s forests. Although most of the deforested (i.e.-developed) lands will never return to their pristine forested condition, the preservation, conservation, and wise management of Maryland’s remaining forests is vital for watershed health and renewable resources.    Forest health is inextricably linked to healthy streams and a robust Chesapeake Bay. Forests function as filters removing sediments, nutrients and other pollutants from water before they enter the groundwater system and receiving streams. Nutrients, for example, in normal quantities help maintain a healthy bay. The influx of excessive nutrients to the bay caused in part by changes in land use, however, has disrupted the Bay’s ecosystem. Forests also regulate the amount, velocity, and rate of runoff maintaining a water body’s natural hydrology. Forested riparian buffers along streams and rivers stabilize banks, reducing erosion and sedimentation. These riparian buffers also enhance aquatic habitat by shading streams, providing woody debris for in-stream structure, and regulating stream temperature. Protecting Maryland’s forest resources will greatly contribute to nonpoint source pollution reductions.      Pursuant to CZARA Section 6217, Maryland state agencies and local governments are working to implement the ten management measures that were developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These management measures are defined as economically achievable measures for the control of the addition of pollutants from existing and new categories and classes of nonpoint sources of pollution, which reflect the greatest degree of pollutant reduction achievable through the application of the best available nonpoint pollution control practices, technologies, processes, siting criteria, operating methods, or other alternatives. Specific information describing how Maryland is addressing these management measures can be found in this chapter under the discussion heading Forestry Management Measures - Enforceable Policies and Mechanisms.    Forestry Programs    Standard Erosion and Sediment Control Plan for Forest Harvest Operations    Maryland law requires that a sediment control plan be approved before undertaking any earth-disturbing activity over 5,000 square feet. To assist loggers and landowners in meeting this requirement, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) have developed a  Compliance Agreement for the Standard Erosion and Sediment Control Plan for Forest Harvest Operations (Standard Plan) . This plan lists the general sediment control requirements for each harvest and may be obtained at any Soil Conservation District (SCD) office.      The state offers each county the opportunity to enforce the minimum requirements of these laws and regulations within its jurisdiction. The counties must prove they will enforce the minimum requirements of state law and regulation regarding soil erosion and sedimentation. Some counties have made the requirements more stringent.      When a harvest is planned on private property, landowners are required to contact the local SCD office to obtain the compliance agreement plan and have it approved. MDE must approve the plan for harvests on state and federal land.      The potential for sediment loss from a forest harvest site is greatest at three locations: entrances to the site, the forest access system (haul roads, skid trails, and landings), and adjacent to watercourses. The standard plan, therefore, emphasizes sediment control in these areas. The primary requirements for these areas are:        Site Entrances : Access points to the site which lead from a   paved road must be protected with stone, wood chips, corduroy logs, wooden mats, or other   materials which prevent soil or mud from being tracked onto the road. It is also necessary   to prevent the existing drainage pattern from being blocked or damaged by the access   construction. A culvert placed underneath the road entrance is the most effective way to   maintain proper drainage.     Trails and Landings : Advance planning of the location of roads,   trails, and landings is effective to minimize the potential for soil erosion. Roads and   trails located along natural contours and minimum slopes reduce the need for substantial   cutting and filling operations. Stream crossings should be avoided whenever possible as   they create one of the greatest sediment pollution hazards. Permits for a ""Temporary   Access Crossing"" for streams may be required.       Waterway Borders : Protecting watercourses from runoff and   equipment damage is the most critical aspect of sediment control during harvest   operations. Improper stream crossings, soil disturbance adjacent to streams, and discarded   logging debris may result in sediment pollution and flooding.      In addition to these practices, the standard plan requires individuals to stabilize the harvest site and manage stream buffer areas.    The plan requires that uncut buffer zones, called Streamside Management Zones (SMZ), be maintained on all sides of perennial or intermittent streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, bogs or marshes. The width of the buffer is dependent upon the slope of the land adjacent to the watercourse. The Streamside Management Zone horizontal width is measured in linear feet from the pond, lake or stream to the toe of road, skid trail, or other surface disturbance.                  Average Percent Slope To Water Course       Width of Buffer (feet) on each side of     watercourse               0%       50 ft.               1-10%       75 ft.               11-20%         100 ft.               21-30%       150 ft.               31-40%         200 ft.               41%         + 250 ft.            The buffer widths above are required in the Standard Plan. Different requirements apply to buffers in the Critical Area. The Maryland Standards and Specifications for Forest Harvesting are currently under revision and will include standards for the use of logging mats and other new BMPs. Research has demonstrated that water quality impacts from harvesting are minimal if conducted using best management practices. A survey of BMP compliance in 1995 showed an average 82% use of BMPs, ranging from 68% for soil stabilization to 90% for landings and logdecks. Streamside management zones had 83% use. Compliance monitoring will be repeated, periodically subject to the availability of funding.          Lead Agency: Maryland Department of the Environment      Nontidal Wetlands Protection Program    The Maryland Nontidal Wetlands Protection Act and Regulations require the use of best management practices (BMPs) when logging in nontidal wetlands. When filing an erosion and sediment control plan for a forest harvest operation in nontidal wetlands, BMPs must be included that will protect the wetland hydrology.    Forestry activities do not require a nontidal wetland permit if the land use remains as forestry. The regulations do require a person conducting forestry activities in nontidal wetlands to implement BMPs to protect nontidal wetlands. These BMPs must be incorporated into the Standard Plan prepared by a licensed forester. The Soil Conservation District must identify or verify the extent of nontidal wetlands. The operator must notify the Soil Conservation District when site conditions require a change in BMPs.    The Nontidal Wetland regulations state that for forest harvest and regeneration practices, BMPs may include: designing stream crossings to have the shortest distance feasible, locating roads and log decks to minimize adverse wetland impacts, harvesting with specialized equipment when nontidal wetland soils and hydrology will be adversely affected, and using mats or similar temporary structures to reduce compaction or rutting.    Additional guidelines are provided for a pre-harvest plan in wetland areas. It should include:        Identification of special equipment required for skidding and hauling     or other harvesting methods, (barge, cable, etc). Use machinery with adequate flotation     devices to minimize the impact on the soil surface or degradation of site quality.     Flotation devices should keep rutting within acceptable limits.              Identification of potential problems or events that may interrupt     logging operations.              Identification of suitable alternative measures which protect water     and soils.              Schedule operations that promote harvesting during extreme dry     periods or during times that enhance regeneration.          If a stream crossing is unavoidable, MDE, Water Management Administration, requires that a Nontidal Wetland and Waterway Permit be obtained if the drainage area above the crossing exceeds 400 acres, or exceeds 100 acres for designated trout streams.          Lead Agency: Maryland Department of the Environment      Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Program    The Chesapeake Bay Critical Area is the land within 1000 feet of the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal waters or tidal wetlands. For one acre or more of forest in the Critical Area to be cut within any one-year interval, a Timber Harvest Plan must be prepared and approved before any timber can be harvested. The following information must be included in a Timber Harvest Plan to meet the forest and woodland protection criteria: 1) description of measures to maintain surface water and groundwater quality; 2) a determination of whether the harvest will disturb or affect Habitat Protection Areas, and description of measures incorporated to protect any Habitat Protection Area; 3) a description of the timing, intensity, and size of the harvest which assures continuity of wildlife habitat; 4) confirmation of a Standard Plan; and 5) confirmation that cutting in the Critical Area buffer will be in accordance with the buffer regulations. A sediment control plan is required for all harvests of 5,000 square feet or more of disturbed area in the Critical Area. Also the timber harvest plan must include a description of the mitigation and details regarding afforestation and reforestation. The plan must be prepared by a registered professional forester and approved by the DNR project forester and the local Forestry Board.          Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Natural Resources      Special Rivers Project    DNR’s Forest Service administers the Special Rivers Project to improve water quality by encouraging the restoration, enhancement, and management of forests. The Special Rivers Project is made possible through the Chesapeake Bay Implementation Grant of the CWA Section 117(b). The objectives of the project are to:        1) improve watershed planning and riparian forest restoration by   involving landowners, communities, and public agencies in forest protection, restoration,   and management within the designated watershed;       2) initiate and conduct demonstration and monitoring projects to show   how working landscapes and riparian forests improve both water quality and living   resources habitats; and     3) plan and implement information and education efforts to inform   individuals about the importance of riparian forest buffers and well-managed woodlands in   improving the health of the Chesapeake Bay.        These objectives are targeted in four watersheds of the state: Town Creek Watershed (Allegany County), Susquehanna Watershed (Harford, Cecil, and Baltimore counties), Anacostia Watershed (Montgomery, Anne Arundel, and Prince Georges counties), and Monocacy Watershed (Carroll and Frederick counties).      The watershed planning and restoration efforts include strategies for involving landowner, communities and public agencies in implementing protection, restoration and management techniques, such as riparian forest buffer establishment within the designated watershed. Ecological demonstration and monitoring efforts transfer technology through interpretive means including signage, brochures, technical reports, guided field tours, and slide presentations. Information and education outreach efforts use a variety of delivery mechanisms including Forest Stewardship Plan preparation, planting site examinations, news releases, exhibits and displays, and workshops and seminars.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Natural Resources      Maryland Stream Releaf Program    In October 1994, the Chesapeake Executive Council adopted Directive 94-1 which called upon the Chesapeake Bay Program to develop a policy that would enhance riparian stewardship and efforts to conserve and restore riparian forest buffers. The Council adopted the goal of restoring 2,010 miles of stream and shoreline buffers in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed by the year 2010. It also directed each state and federal government to establish a buffer implementation plan by June 1998.    In response, Maryland established the Stream Releaf Program. This implementation plan lays out goals, objectives, actions, and performance measures in five major areas for Maryland to reach its commitment:          1) Restore 600 miles of riparian buffers by 2010;       2) Conserve existing riparian buffers;       3) Use incentives for landowner participation;       4) Communicate with stakeholders and the general public; and       5) Coordinate existing and new programs along with people and efforts.     Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Natural Resources      The Maryland Forest Conservation Program    In January 1990, the Governor’s Task Force on Trees and Forests was created to assess the problems facing Maryland’s trees and forests, identify solutions to these problems and more importantly, promote good land stewardship and protection of Maryland’s trees and forest. The Task Force developed the Report of the Governor’s Task force on Trees and Forests in Maryland, July 12, 1990, which listed 21 task force recommendations. Task Force Recommendation Number 7 stated, ""Adopt a statewide tree and forest conservation, protection and reforestation law that provides for local implementation."" This recommendation lead to the creation of the Forest Conservation Act.    The Forest Conservation Act of 1991 (FCA) was enacted to protect the forests of Maryland by making the identification and protection of forests and other sensitive areas an integral part of the site planning process. It is administered by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Forest Service (MD DNR FS), but implemented by both state and local governments. The MD DNR FS is responsible for the effective implementation of the FCA through oversight of local forest conservation programs and direct review of State-funded and State Agency projects. The primary objective of the FCA is to minimize loss of forest land from development and ensure that priority areas for forest retention and forest planting are identified and protected prior to development. The priority areas include areas adjacent to streams and wetlands, on steep slopes and erodible soils, in or adjacent to large contiguous forest blocks, and within or creating connecting wildlife corridors.    The FCA establishes standards for local authorities to enforce during development. Protection of these areas may occur through establishing long term protection agreements as part of the local approval of Forest Conservation Plans. In addition, sensitive areas located off-site provide opportunities for replanting, conservation and protection under a local comprehensive plan or when approved as a technique for afforestation or reforestation.    The 1991 Maryland Forest Conservation Act is the primary guiding legislation governing the afforestation and conservation of forest lands in Maryland. This act requires local governments with planning and zoning authority to develop and implement local forest conservation programs. The programs must include new and amended ordinances relating to regulated activities, exemptions, review processes, and enforcement and penalties, along with a technical manual with requirements for forest stand delineations, information for forest conservation plan approval, and specific forest conservation criteria and techniques. After the approval of local plans, DNR must review local forest conservation plans at least once every two years and may assume responsibility for project and plan review and approval 90 days after notice of noncompliance is given to local authorities    The FCA also requires that by July 1 of each year that the local authorities submit a report that includes information on: (1) the number, location, and type of projects subject to the FCA; (2) the amount and location of areas cleared, conserved and planted in connection with a development project; (3) the amount of reforestation and afforestation fees and noncompliance penalties collected and expended; and, (4) the costs of implementing the forest conservation program.    The MD DNR FS has compiled information from the time period of January 1993 through June 1997 into a 5 year summary of forest conservation activities statewide. The data analyzed in the report focuses on the amount of forest on the site prior to development and the amount of forest designated to remain or be planted on site after development.    Analysis of reports from county forest conservation programs indicates that on average 65 percent of existing forest is retained on development sites. In total, 20,933 acres of existing forest have been retained, 11,279 acres have been cleared, and 3,808 acres have been planted. Further examination of the data reveals that the majority of development-related clearing in Maryland occurred within the Baltimore-Washington Corridor, with 55 percent occurring in just three counties. These three - Montgomery, Prince George’s, and Charles Counties - also accounted for 43 percent of the retention and 56 percent of the planting statewide. These high percentages reflect the large volume of development activity - both in area and numbers - in these counties, with 52 percent of the existing forest under review occurring in these same three counties. Interestingly, Charles County reported the highest number of acres of forest cleared (2,705 acres), but this county also had the highest percentage of forest cover (61 percent) of the counties required to implement Forest Conservation. A trend was noted that counties with high amounts of existing forest had lower planting to clearing ratios, while counties with smaller percentages of forest cover and existing forest, had higher planting to clearing ratios. Thus, development activities in counties dominated by agricultural land uses, such as Kent or Carroll (with 23 and 25 percent forest cover respectively) were required to plant proportionately more forest than in heavier forested counties.    In many instances, more forest has been retained than required by the law. Thus, through required and voluntary actions, 13,462 acres or 120 percent more forest has been retained and planted on development sites than cleared. In the absence of the FCA legislation, a much smaller percentage of forest would have remained on site, and likely very little if any planted in association with development projects. The net result is that Maryland counties have reduced the amount of forest lost to development, and thus maintained a key factor in the protection of the Chesapeake Bay.    Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Natural Resources    Maryland Reforestation Program    The Maryland Reforestation Law was enacted in 1989 to minimize forest disturbance during highway construction. Mitigation is required when one acre or more of forest is cut or cleared. Replacement is required on an acre-for-acre basis and must be carried out on public land. Priority areas for mitigation are on-site or within the same county and watershed as the clearing. If the constructing agent cannot locate a mitigation site, they must deposit money into the Reforestation Fund at 10 per square foot or $4,356 per acre of impact. Mitigation must be completed within one year or two growing seasons after the highway construction project has been completed. Since the law was adopted, over 1,550 acres of forested land have been cleared by highway construction and DNR has planted over 1,110 acres through fee-in-lieu funding. Mitigation plantings are planned annually in the Spring.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Natural Resources      Stewardship Incentive Program    The Stewardship Incentive Program provides financial assistance to private forest owners to manage their land. Cost-sharing incentives are offered to participants who agree to adopt and carry out a comprehensive Forest Stewardship Plan. Each plan is based on realistic management objectives that match the landowner’s interests and goals given the capability of his or her land. Recommended practices in the plan receiving cost-share assistance must be maintained for a minimum of ten years. The maximum amount a landowner may receive in a year is $10,000. The nine broad practices are:              Stewardship plan preparation;             Forestation;             Forest improvements;             Windbreaks and hedgerows;             Soil and water protection;             Riparian and wetland protection;             Fisheries and aquatic habitat enhancement;             Wildlife habitat improvement; and             Forest recreation opportunity enhancement.                This program is federally funded and received no appropriation in FY1999.          Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Natural Resources      Buffer Incentive Program    The Buffer Incentive Program encourages the planting and maintenance of forested buffers around the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. This program helps private landowners defray the cost of establishing and maintaining these buffers. It offers a one-time payment of $300 per acre ($30 per one-tenth acre) upon verification of a least a 65 percent seedling survival rate after one growing season. A reduced payment of 50 percent is payable for survival of 50 to 65 percent of the seedlings. Thirty to 35 landowners plant approximately 250 to 300 acres annually.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Natural Resources      Roadside Tree Law    This Law requires DNR Forest Service to supervise tree maintenance work performed in rights-of-way to maintain electricity, telephone, and other utilities. Licenses are issued and training is provided to tree experts who maintain trees in rights-of-way. Also, permits are issued to citizens who want to care for trees in rights-of-way adjacent to their homes.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Natural Resources      Forest Conservancy District Boards    In 1906, the Maryland State Board of Forestry was established, and in 1943 the Forest Conservancy District Law was passed to establish a Board in each county. Each Board is made up of citizens of the county who work to perpetuate Maryland’s forest resource.    Board members are volunteers who provide grassroots leadership for the improvement of the environment. They are community representatives responsible for promoting forest management and education, as well as advising Maryland’s DNR Forest Service. Further, they are a sounding board and a liaison between private individuals, forest-related industry, and government agencies. The Forest Conservancy District Boards, or Forestry Boards, focus their work on educating people about benefits that forests and trees provide and educating school students interested in pursuing careers in natural resources. Also, they are involved with the Chesapeake Bay School Reforestation Project, legislative networking, and reviewing plans to cut trees from forests in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Natural Resources      Master Logger Program    The Maryland Master Logger Program is a series of comprehensive training courses designed for the logging professional. Program attendance is voluntary and landowners, foresters and others may also attend. The Program endorses only those loggers that complete the training agenda. Initial training covers forest management principles, forest ecology, proper harvest design and layout, safety practices, and life-saving skills. Upon completion of these courses, Master Loggers must attend at least one Continuing Education course each year to maintain their status. This requirement ensures that the Master Logger has knowledge of the most current laws and techniques in the industry. The Directory of Master Loggers is updated biannually.          Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Natural Resources      Incentive Programs    There are a host of incentive programs offered by federal, state, and nonprofit organizations to private landowners to encourage the protection and creation of forest and buffers. Program descriptions are found in the Financial Assistance section of this document.      Forestry Management Measures - Enforceable Policies and Mechanisms    Pursuant to CZARA Section 6217, the forestry community is currently working to implement the ten management measures described below. The following section identifies: 1) the required management measures as developed by EPA and NOAA; 2) a description of how they apply to Maryland’s forest industry; and, 3) a table listing Maryland’s enforceable polices and mechanisms used to address the federal requirements.    The final section in this chapter contains a Five-Year Action Plan (1998 - 2002) that describes what actions the state is taking over the next 5 years to implement the management measures.    Table 4.16: Management Measure - Pre-harvest Planning                Pre-harvest Planning               Perform advance planning for forest harvesting that     includes the following elements where appropriate: (1) Identify the area to be harvested     including location of waterbodies and sensitive areas such as wetlands, threatened or     endangered aquatic species habitat areas, or high- erosion-hazard areas (landslide-prone     areas) within the harvest unit.         (2) Time the activity for the season or moisture conditions when the least impact     occurs.       (3) Consider potential water quality impacts and erosion and sedimentation control in     the selection of silvicultural and regeneration systems, especially for harvesting and     site preparation.         (4) Reduce the risk of occurrence of landslides and severe erosion by identifying     high-erosion-hazard areas and avoiding harvesting in such areas to the extent practicable.             (5) Consider additional contributions from harvesting or roads to any known existing     water quality impairments or problems in watersheds of concern.         Perform advance planning for forest road systems that includes the following elements     where appropriate:       (1) Locate and design road systems to minimize, to the extent practicable, potential     sediment generation and delivery to surface waters. Key components are:               ! locate roads, landings, and skid trails to       avoid to the extent practicable steep grades and steep hill areas, and to decrease the       number of stream crossings;           ! avoid to the extent practicable locating       new roads and landings in Streamside Management Areas (SMAs); and         ! determine road usage and select the       appropriate road standard.             (2) Locate and design temporary and permanent stream crossings to prevent failure and     control impacts from the road system. Key components are:               ! size and site crossing structures to       prevent failure;         ! for fish-bearing streams, design crossings       to facilitate fish passage.             (3) Ensure that the design of road prism and the road surface drainage are appropriate     to the terrain and that road surface design is consistent with the road drainage     structures.         (4) Use suitable materials to surface roads planned for all-weather use to support     truck traffic.       (5) Design road systems to avoid high erosion or landslide hazard areas. Identify these     areas and consult a qualified specialist for design of any roads that must be constructed     through these areas.       Each state should develop a process (or utilize an existing process) that ensures that     the management measures in this chapter are implemented. Such a process should include     appropriate notification, compliance audits, or other mechanisms for forestry activities     with the potential for significant adverse nonpoint source effects based on the type and     size of operation and the presence of stream crossings or SMAs.            Note: This measure applies to lands where silvaculture or forestry operations are planned or conducted.

Table 4.18: Management Measure - Streamside Management                Streamside Management               Establish and maintain a streamside management area     (SMA) along surface waters, which is sufficiently wide and which includes a sufficient     number of canopy species to buffer against detrimental changes in the temperature regime     of the waterbody, to provide bank stability, and to withstand wind damage. Manage the SMA     in such a way as to protect against soil disturbance in the SMA and delivery to the stream     of sediments and nutrients generated by forestry activities, including harvesting. Manage     the SMA canopy species to provide a sustainable source of large woody debris needed for     instream channel structure and aquatic species habitat.            Note:   This measure applies to lands where forestry operations are planned or conducted. It is intended to apply to surface waters bordering or within the area of operations. Streamside management areas should be established for perennial waterbodies as well as for intermittent streams that are flowing during the time of operation (winter logging operations should provide streamside management areas for intermittent streams).    Table 4.19: Enforceable Policies and Mechanisms                Enforceable Policy & Mechanism -See the     Pre-harvest Planning management measure for a description of the enforceable policies that     directly apply.            Table 4.20: Management Measure - Road Construction/Reconstruction                Road Construction/Reconstruction               1) Follow pre-harvest planning (as described under     Management Measure A) when constructing or reconstructing the roadway. (2) Follow     designs planned under Management Measure A for road surfacing and shaping.       (3) Install road drainage structures according to designs planned under Management     Measure A and regional storm return period and installation specifications. Match these     drainage structures with terrain features and with road surface and prism designs.       (4) Guard against the production of sediment when installing stream crossings.       (5) Protect surface waters from slash and debris material from roadway clearing.       (6) Use straw bales, silt fences, mulching, or other favorable practices on disturbed     soils on unstable cuts, fills, etc.       (7) Avoid constructing new roads in SMAs to the extent practicable.            Note: This measure applies to lands where forestry operations are planned or conducted. It is intended to apply to road construction/reconstruction operations for silvaculture purposes, including clearing, pioneering, construction, and surfacing (if applicable).    Table 4.21: Enforceable Policies and Mechanisms                Enforceable Policy & Mechanism -See the     Pre-harvest Planning management measure for a description of the enforceable policies that     directly apply.            Table 4.22: Management Measure - Road Management                Road Management               (1) Avoid using roads where possible for timber hauling     or heavy traffic during wet or thaw periods on roads not designed and constructed for     these conditions. (2) Evaluate the future need for a road and close roads that will not     be needed. Leave closed roads and drainage channels in a stable condition to withstand     storms.       (3) Remove drainage crossings and culverts if there is a reasonable risk of plugging or     failure from lack of maintenance.       (4) Following completion of harvesting, close and stabilize temporary spur roads and     seasonal roads to control and direct water away from the roadway. Remove all temporary     stream crossings.       (5) Inspect roads to determine the need for structural maintenance. Conduct maintenance     practices, when conditions warrant, including cleaning and replacement of deteriorated     structures and erosion controls, grading or seeding of road surfaces, and, in extreme     cases, slope stabilization or removal of road fills where necessary to maintain structural     integrity.       (6) Conduct maintenance activities, such as dust abatement, so that chemical     contaminants or pollutants are not introduced into surface waters to the extent     practicable.       (7) Properly maintain permanent stream crossings and associated fills and approaches to     reduce the likelihood (a) that stream overflow will divert onto roads, and (b) that fill     erosion will occur if the drainage structures become obstructed.            Note:  This measure applies to lands where forestry operations are planned or conducted. It is intended to apply to active and inactive roads constructed or used for silviculture activities.    Table 4.23: Enforceable Policies and Management                Enforceable Policy & Mechanism -See the     Pre-harvest Planning management measure for a description of the enforceable policies that     directly apply.            Table 4.24: Management Measure - Timber Harvesting                Timber Harvesting               The timber harvesting management measure consists of     implementing the following: (1) Timber harvesting operations with skid trails or     cable yarding follow layouts determined under Management Measure A.       (2) Install landing drainage structures to avoid sedimentation to the extent     practicable. Disperse landing drainage over sideslopes.         (3) Construct landings away from steep slopes and reduce the likelihood of fill slope     failures. Protect landing surfaces used during wet periods. Locate landings outside of     SMAs.       (4) Protect stream channels and significant ephemeral drainages from logging debris and     slash material.       (5) Use appropriate areas for petroleum storage, draining, dispensing. Establish     procedures to contain and treat spills. Recycle or properly dispose of all waste     materials.       For cable yarding:      (1) Limit yarding corridor gouge or soil plowing by properly locating cable yarding     landings.       (2) Locate corridors for SMAs following Management Measure B.        For groundskidding:      (1) Within SMAs, operate groundskidding equipment only at stream crossings to the extent     practicable. In SMAs, fell and endline trees to avoid sedimentation.       (2) Use improved stream crossings for skid trails which cross flowing drainages.     Construct skid trails to disperse runoff and with adequate drainage structures.       (3) On steep slopes, use cable systems rather than groundskidding where groundskidding     may cause excessive sedimentation.            Note: This measure applies to lands where forestry operations are planned or conducted. It is intended to apply to all harvesting, yarding and hauling conducted as part of normal silviculture activities on harvest units larger than 5 acres. This measure does not apply to harvesting conducted for precommercial thinnings or noncommercial firewood.

(2) Conduct mechanical tree planting and ground-disturbing site preparation activities     on the contour of sloping terrain.       (3) Do not conduct mechanical site preparation and mechanical tree planting in     streamside management areas.       (4) Protect surface waters from logging debris and slash material.       (5) Suspend operations during wet periods if equipment used begins to cause excessive     soil disturbance that will increase erosion.       (6) Locate windrows at a safe distance from drainages and SMAs to control movement of     the material during high runoff conditions.       (7) Conduct bedding operations in high-water-table areas during dry periods of the     year. Conduct bedding in sloping areas on the contour.       (8) Protect small ephemeral drainages when conducting mechanical tree planting.            Note:  This measure applies to lands where forestry operations are planned or conducted. It is intended to apply to all site preparation and regeneration activities conducted as as part of normal silviculture activities on harvest units larger than 5 acres.

Table 4.28: Management Measure - Fire Management                Fire Management               Prescribe fire for site preparation and control or     suppress wildfire in a manner which reduces potential nonpoint source pollution of surface     waters: (1) Intense prescribed fire should not cause excessive sedimentation due to the     combined effect of removal of canopy species and the loss of soil-binding ability of     subcanopy and herbaceous vegetation roots, especially in SMAs, in streamside vegetation     for small ephemeral drainages, or on very steep slopes.       (2) Prescriptions for prescribed fire should protect against excessive erosion or     sedimentation to the extent practicable.       (3) All bladed firelines, for prescribed fire and wildfire, should be plowed on contour     or stabilized with water bars and/or other appropriate techniques if needed to control     excessive sedimentation or erosion of the fireline.       (4) Wildfire suppression and rehabilitation should consider possible NPS pollution of     watercourses, while recognizing the safety and operational priorities of fighting     wildfires.            Note:  This measure applies to lands where forestry operations are planned or conducted. It is intended to apply to all prescribed burning conducted as part of normal silviculture activities on harvest units larger than 5 acres and for wildfire suppression and rehabilitation on forest lands.    The Department of Natural Resources has issued an Operation Order which requires that a prescribed burn plan must be submitted and approved prior to any prescribed burn.

Developed Lands    Introduction    Nonpoint source pollution is runoff caused by rainfall, snowmelt, and irrigation water that moves over the ground and through the groundwater, picking up pollutants such as nutrients, sediments, toxics, and bacteria and eventually depositing them in streams, lakes, rivers, and bays. One major source of nonpoint source pollution in Maryland is developed lands. According to the Chesapeake Bay Program’s (CBP) Phase IV Model and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Integrated Watershed Analysis and Management System (IWAMS), 13 percent of the nitrogen and 12 percent of the phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay comes from developed lands. Because of the inevitable increase in urban areas around the state, it is critical to control nonpoint source pollution from this source. Maryland has several urban nonpoint source control programs that focus on new development, redevelopment, and new and relocated highways, bridges, and roads.      Why Stormwater Matters    Urban development has an profound influence on the quality of Maryland’s water. To start, development dramatically alters the local hydrologic cycle. The hydrology of a site changes during the initial clearing and grading that occur during construction. Trees, meadow grasses, and agricultural crops that had intercepted and absorbed rainfall are removed and natural depressions that had temporarily ponded water are graded to a uniform slope. Cleared and graded sites erode, are often severely compacted, and can no longer prevent rainfall from being rapidly converted into stormwater runoff.      The situation worsens after construction. Roof tops, roads, parking lots, driveways and other impervious surfaces no longer allow rainfall to soak into the ground. Consequently, most rainfall is converted directly to stormwater runoff. The volume of stormwater runoff increases sharply as a function of site imperviousness. For example, a one acre parking lot can produce 16 times more stormwater runoff than a one acre meadow each year.    The increase in stormwater runoff can be too much for the existing natural drainage system to handle. As a result, the natural drainage system is often ""improved"" to rapidly collect runoff and quickly convey it away (using curb and gutter, enclosed storm sewers, and lined channels). The stormwater runoff is subsequently discharged to downstream waters such as streams, reservoirs, lakes or estuaries.    Declining Water Quality    Impervious surfaces accumulate pollutants deposited from the atmosphere, leaked from vehicles, or windblown from adjacent areas. During storm events, these pollutants quickly wash off and are rapidly delivered to downstream waters. The following paragraphs describe some of the common pollutants found in urban stormwater runoff.      Nutrients.    Urban runoff has elevated concentrations of both phosphorus and nitrogen, which can enrich streams, lakes, reservoirs and estuaries. In particular, excess nutrients have been documented to be a major factor in the decline of the Chesapeake Bay. Excess nutrients promote algal growth that blocks sunlight from reaching underwater grasses and depletes oxygen in bottom waters. Urban runoff has been identified as a key and controllable source.      Suspended solids.    Sources of sediment include washoff of particles that are deposited on impervious surfaces and the erosion of streambanks and construction sites. Both suspended and deposited sediments can have adverse effects on aquatic life in streams, lakes and estuaries. Sediments also transport other attached pollutants.      Organic Carbon.    Organic matter, washed from impervious surfaces during storms, can present a problem in slower moving downstream waters. As organic matter decomposes, it can deplete dissolved oxygen in lakes and tidal waters. Low levels of oxygen in the water can have an adverse impact on aquatic life.      Bacteria..    Bacteria levels in stormwater runoff routinely exceed public health standards for water contact recreation. Stormwater runoff can also lead to the closure of adjacent shellfish beds and swimming beaches and may increase the cost of treating drinking water at water supply reservoirs.      Hydrocarbons . Vehicles leak oil and grease which contain a wide array of hydrocarbon compounds, some of which can be toxic at low concentrations to aquatic life.      Trace Metals.    Cadmium, copper, lead and zinc are routinely found in stormwater runoff. These metals can be toxic to aquatic life at certain concentrations and can also accumulate in the sediments of streams, lakes and the Chesapeake Bay.      Pesticides.    A modest number of currently used and recently banned insecticides and herbicides have been detected in urban stormflow at concentrations that approach or exceed toxicity thresholds for aquatic life.        Chlorides.    Salts that are applied to roads and parking lots in the winter months appear in stormwater runoff and meltwater at much higher concentrations than many freshwater organisms can tolerate.      Thermal Impacts.    Impervious surfaces may increase temperature in receiving waters, adversely impacting aquatic life that requires cold and cool water conditions (e.g., trout).      Trash and Debris.    Considerable quantities of trash and debris are washed through storm drain networks. The trash and debris accumulate in streams and lakes and detract from their natural beauty.    Diminishing Groundwater Recharge and Quality    The slow infiltration of rainfall through the soil layer is essential for replenishing goundwater. The amount of rainfall that recharges groundwater varies, depending on the slope, soil, and vegetation. Groundwater is a critical water resource across the State. Not only do many residents depend on groundwater for their drinking water, but the health of many aquatic systems is also dependent on its steady discharge. For example, during periods of dry weather, groundwater sustains flows in streams and helps to maintain the hydrology of non-tidal wetlands. Because development creates imperious surfaces that prevent natural recharge, a net decrease in groundwater recharge rates can be expected in urban watersheds. Thus, during prolonged periods of dry weather, stream flow sharply diminishes. In smaller headwater streams, the decline in stream flow can cause a perennial stream to become seasonally dry.      Urban land uses and activities can also degrade groundwater quality if stormwater runoff is directed into the soil without adequate treatment. Certain land uses and activities are known to produce higher loads of metals and toxic chemicals and are designated as stormwater hotspots. Soluble pollutants, such as chloride, nitrate, copper, dissolved solids and some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH""s) can migrate into groundwater and potentially contaminate wells. Stormwater runoff should never be infiltrated into the soil if a site is a designated hotspot.      Degradation of Stream Channels    Stormwater runoff is a powerful force that influences the geometry of streams. After development, both the frequency and magnitude of storm flow increase dramatically. Consequently, urban stream channels experience more bankfull and sub-bankfull flow events each year than they had prior to development. As a result, the stream bed and banks are exposed to highly erosive flows more frequently and for longer periods. Streams typically respond to this change by increasing cross-sectional area to handle the more frequent and erosive flows either by channel widening or down cutting, or both. This results in a highly unstable phase where the stream experiences severe bank erosion and habitat degradation. In this phase, the stream often experiences some of the following changes:              rapid stream widening             increased streambank and channel erosion             decline in stream substrate quality (through sediment deposition and       embedding of the substrate)             loss of pool/riffle structure in the stream channel             degradation of stream habitat structure                The decline in the physical habitat of the stream, coupled with lower base flows and higher stormwater pollutant loads, has a severe impact on the aquatic community. Recent research has shown the following changes in stream ecology:              decline in aquatic insect and freshwater mussel diversity             decline in fish diversity             degradation of aquatic habitat                Traditionally, Maryland has attempted to provide some measure of channel protection by imposing the two-year storm peak discharge control requirement, which requires that the discharge from the two-year post development peak rates be reduced to pre development levels. However, recent research and experience indicate that the two-year peak discharge criterion is not capable of protecting downstream channels from erosion. In some cases, controlling the two year storm may actually accelerate streambank erosion because it exposes the channel to a longer duration of erosive flows than it would have otherwise received.    Increased Overbank Flooding    Flow events that exceed the capacity of the stream channel spill out into adjacent floodplains. These are termed ""overbank"" floods and can damage property and downstream drainage structures.    While some overbank flooding is inevitable and even desirable, the historical goal of drainage design in most of Maryland has been to maintain pre development peak discharge rates for both the two and ten-year frequency storms after development, thus keeping the level of overbank flooding the same over time. This prevents costly damage or maintenance for culverts, drainage structures, and swales.    Overbank floods are ranked in terms of their statistical return frequency. For example, a flood that has a 50% chance of occurring in any given year is termed a ""two year"" flood. The two-year storm is also known as the ""bankfull flood,"" as researchers have demonstrated that most natural stream channels in the State have just enough capacity to handle the two-year flood before spilling into the floodplain. In Maryland, about 3.0 to 3.5 inches of rain in a 24-hour period produces a two-year or bankfull flood. This rainfall depth is termed the two-year design storm.    Similarly, a flood that has a 10% chance of occurring in any given year is termed a ""ten-year flood."" A ten-year flood occurs when a storm event produces about 4.5 to 5.5 inches of rain in a 24 hour period. Under traditional engineering practice, most channels and storm drains in Maryland are designed with enough capacity to safely pass the peak discharge from the ten-year design storm. Urban development increases the peak discharge rate associated with a given design storm because impervious surfaces generate greater runoff volumes and drainage systems deliver it more rapidly to a stream.      Floodplain Expansion    The level areas bordering streams and rivers are known as floodplains. Operationally, the floodplain is usually defined as the land area within the limits of the 100-year storm flow water elevation. The 100-year storm has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year and typically serves as the basis for controlling development in the State and establishing insurance rates by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In Maryland, a 100-year flood occurs after about 7 to 8 inches of rainfall in a 24 hour period (e.g., the 100-year storm). These floods can be very destructive and can pose a threat to property and human life.    Floodplains are natural flood storage areas and help to attenuate downstream flooding. Floodplains are very important habitat areas, encompassing riparian forest, wetlands, and wildlife corridors. Consequently, all local jurisdictions in Maryland restrict or even prohibit new development within the 100-year floodplain to prevent flood hazards and conserve habitats. Nevertheless, prior development that has occurred in the floodplain remains subject to periodic flooding during these storms.    As with overbank floods, development sharply increases the peak discharge rate associated with the 100-year design storm. As a consequence, the elevation of a stream’s 100 year floodplain becomes higher and the boundaries of its floodplain expand. In some instances, property and structures that had not previously been subject to flooding are now at risk. Additionally, such a shift in a floodplain’s hydrology can degrade wetlands and forest habitats.    Pursuant to CZARA Section 6217, the Maryland Department of the Envrionment and DNR are currently working to implement the thirteen management measures that were developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These management measures are defined as economically achievable measures for the control of the addition of pollutants from existing and new categories and classes of nonpoint sources of pollution, which reflect the greatest degree of pollutant reduction achievable through the application of the best available nonpoint pollution control practices, technologies, processes, siting criteria, operating methods, or other alternatives. Specific information describing how Maryland is addressing these management measures can be found in this chapter under the discussion heading Developed Lands Management Measures - Enforceable Policies and Mechanisms.    Listed below are programs that address urban nonpoint source pollution control issues.    Developed Lands Nonpoint Source Programs    Stormwater Management Program    The Environment Article Title 4, Subtitle 2, Annotated Code of Maryland states that ""...the management of stormwater runoff is necessary to reduce stream channel erosion, pollution, siltation and sedimentation, and local flooding, all of which have adverse impacts on the water and land resources of Maryland."" The Maryland Department of the Environment, Stormwater Management Program was designed in the early 1980s to address this finding of the General Assembly concentrated primarily on controlling runoff increases and mitigating water quality degradation associated with new development. The counties and municipalities in Maryland are responsible for administering effective stormwater management programs that ""...maintain after development, as nearly as possible the pre development characteristics..."" These localities have preformed remarkably in establishing Maryland as a national leader in stormwater management technology. Over the last 14 years, tens of thousands of best management practices (BMPs) have been constructed in an attempt to meet program mandates. However, the experience gained since Maryland’s stormwater statute was enacted has identified necessary improvements and revealed a need to refocus the approach to fulfill the original intent of this essential water pollution control program.    Recently, increased emphasis on water quality, resource protection needs, increased BMP maintenance costs, and identified shortcomings in Maryland’s program have all contributed to basic philosophical changes regarding stormwater management. The Program is currently in the process of finalizing draft regulations in an effort to incorporate the significant experiences gained by the State’s stormwater community and accommodate much needed improvements for managing urban runoff. The proposed regulation changes include incorporating the new Maryland Stormwater Design Manual by reference and addressing re-development.    It is hoped that the design standards and environmental incentives presented in the Manual will produce better methods and advance the science of managing stormwater by relying less on singular BMPs for all development projects and more on mimicking existing hydrology through total site design policies. Additionally, the inherent philosophical change should produce smaller less obtrusive facilities that are more aesthetic and less burdensome on those responsible for long term performance.    The Maryland Stromwater Design Manual includes a unified approach for sizing stormwater BMPs to meet pollutant removal goals, maintain groundwater recharge, reduce stream channel erosion, prevent overbank flooding, and pass extreme floods. It also establishes performance criteria for five groups of water quality BMPs including ponds, wetlands, infiltration practices, filtering systems, and open channel systems. Additional criteria for a series of non-structural techniques and incentives were developed to encourage environmentally sensitive site designs.    The Stormwater Design Manual was developed with three distinct goals:        Protect waters of the state from adverse impacts of urban stormwater     runoff,         Provide design guidance on the most effective structural and non     structural BMPs for development sites, and         Improve the quality of BMPs constructed in the State, specifically     with respect to performance, longevity, safety, maintenance, community acceptance, and     environmental benefit.          The Design Manual is divided into two volumes:        Volume I contains basic technical information for stormwater design     in Maryland.         Volume II contains appendices with supporting information such as     landscaping, construction specifications, design examples and miscellaneous tools for BMP     design.          The Manual is meant to work with the proposed draft regulations to provide environmental incentives and credits. To promote greater use of the Design Manual principles, a series of credits and incentives are provided for use of the following non-structural practices:        Natural Area Conservation         Disconnection of rooftop runoff         Disconnection of non-rooftop runoff         Sheet flow discharge to stream buffers         Environmentally sensitive development         Open section roads         Impervious cover reduction          To prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the State of Maryland has developed thirteen performance standards pending adoption of the draft regulations that must be met at development sites. These standards apply to any construction activity disturbing 5,000 or more square feet of earth. The following development activities are exempt from these performance standards in Maryland:        Agricultural land management activities,         Additions or modifications to existing single family structures, and         Developments that do not disturb more than 5000 square feet of land.          The following performance standards shall be addressed at all sites where stormwater management is required:                Standard No. 1       Site designs shall minimize the generation of     stormwater and utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment.               Standard No. 2       Stormwater runoff generated from development     discharged directly into a jurisdictional wetland or waters of the State shall be     adequately treated.               Standard No. 3       Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be     maintained by promoting infiltration through the use of structural and non-structural     methods. At a minimum, annual recharge from the post development site shall mimic the     annual recharge from pre development site conditions.               Standard No. 4       For new development, structural BMPs shall be     designed to remove 80% of the average annual post development total suspended solids load     (TSS). It is presumed that a BMP complies with this performance standard if it is:                             Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume                                           Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in the ""Maryland         Stormwater Design Manual.""                                         Constructed properly, and                                         Maintained regularly.                           Standard No. 5       On the Eastern Shore, the post development peak     discharge rate shall not exceed the pre development peak discharge rate for the two-year     frequency storm event. Elsewhere in Maryland, local authorities may require that the post     development ten-year peak discharge not exceed the pre development peak discharge if the     channel protection storage volume is provided. In addition, safe conveyance for the     100-year storm event shall be provided.               Standard No. 6       To protect stream channels from degradation,     channel protection storage volume shall be provided by 12 to 24 hours of extended     detention storage for the one year storm event. Channel protection storage shall not be     provided on the Eastern Shore unless the appropriate approval authority determines it is     necessary on a case by case determination.               Standard No. 7       Stormwater discharges to critical areas with     sensitive resources (e.g., cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches,     recharge areas, water supply reservoirs, Chesapeake Bay Critical Area) may be subject to     additional performance criteria or may need to utilize or restrict certain BMPs.               Standard No. 8       All BMPs shall have an enforceable operation and     maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed.               Standard No. 9       Every BMP shall have an acceptable form of water     quality pretreatment.               Standard No. 10       Redevelopment, defined as any construction,     alteration or improvement exceeding 5000 square feet in areas where existing land use is     high density commercial, industrial, institutional or multi-family residential, is     governed by special stormwater sizing criteria depending on the amount of increase or     decrease in impervious area created by the redevelopment.               Standard No. 11       Certain industrial sites are required to prepare     and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan and file a notice of intent (NOI)     under the provisions of Maryland’s Stormwater Industrial National Pollutant Discharge     Elimination System (NPDES) general permit. The stormwater pollution prevention plan     requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites.               Standard No. 12       Stormwater discharges from land uses or     activities with higher potential for pollutant loadings, defined as hotspots, may require     the use of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices. In addition,     stormwater from a hotspot land use may not be infiltrated.               Standard No. 13       In Maryland, local governments are usually     responsible for most stormwater management review authority. Therefore, prior to design,     applicants should always consult with their local reviewing agency to determine if they     are subject to additional stormwater design requirements. In addition, any disturbances     greater than five acres must have NPDES construction general permit coverage with MDE.                Lead Agency: Maryland Department of the Environment      Sediment and Erosion Control Program      MDE establishes policies, procedures, standards, and criteria relating to soil erosion and sediment control and oversees the implementation of local ordinances. In cases where local governments have shown the ability to enforce the provisions of their ordinances they have been delegated erosion and sediment control enforcement authority. In other cases, the state has retained enforcement responsibilities. In addition, MDE is responsible for approving all state and federal erosion and sediment control plans. It conducts periodic reviews of local programs to ensure that implementation is acceptable and it has the authority to suspend delegation and take over any program which does not meet state standards.    Any land clearing, grading, or other earth disturbances require an erosion and sediment control plan approved by the appropriate Soil Conservation District (or by a municipality not within a Soil Conservation District with the exception of Montgomery County and Washington sanitary Sewer Commission (WSSC)) except for: 1) agricultural uses; 2) single family residences on lots of 2 acres or more; 3) activities which disturb less than 500 square feet of land area and 100 cubic yards of fill; 4) state projects; and 5) federal projects. MDE approves plans for state and federal projects except those that disturb less than 5000 square feet of land area or 100 cubic yards of earth. A building or grading permit may not be issued by a county or municipality until the soil erosion and sediment control plan has been approved. In addition, MDE and NPDES municipal separate storm sewer jurisdictions conduct a training program to certify soil erosion and sediment control personnel. It sets guidelines for the contents of the plans; the types of control to be used; the sequencing of construction, inspection, and enforcement; and record keeping.          Lead Agency: Maryland Department of the Environment      Oil Control Program    The Maryland Department of the Environment, Waste Management Administration, administers the Oil Control Program and regulates all oil-related activities, such as aboveground and underground oil storage facilities, oil contaminated soil treatment facilities, and oil transportation. The Program oversees the installation, maintenance, operation and removal of oil storage tanks. The Program maintains a strong field presence. Inspectors investigate complaints of illegal dumping and the improper handling of oil as well as non-compliance with state and federal regulations.    In Maryland, the storage and containment of liquid materials is regulated through conditions of the general NPDES stormwater permit (issued in September 1992). The handling of oil, including transfer and disposal, is regulated through the oil control regulations. MDE has a self-implementing regulation (MD. REGS. CODE tit.26 26.10.01.08) that places all oil handling facilities with capacities of less than 50,000 gallons under a General Oil Operations Permit. This permit requires full compliance with all basic elements of Subtitle 10, Oil Pollution and Tank Management, which includes spill prevention and spill control requirements. Section .20 requires that ""the ultimate disposal of used oil be undertaken in a manner that will prevent water pollution, such as salvaging or sale to a salvage company, or use as fuel, or other methods in accordance with state, federal or local codes.""        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of the Environment      Nontidal Wetlands and Waterways Program    The Nontidal Wetlands and Waterways Division oversees the permit process for construction projects affecting nontidal wetlands. Nontidal wetlands include marshes, swamps, bogs, wet meadows, and bottomland forests. They are inland, freshwater areas usually covered or saturated with water for long periods during the growing season. Nontidal wetlands help protect the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays and streams by filtering phosphorus, nitrogen, and pollutants from upland runoff. They form natural flood retention areas to store floodwaters and slowly release them downstream, reducing flood damages. Nontidal wetland vegetation helps stabilize stream banks and reduce streambank erosion. They also provide habitat for fish and wildlife, including many rare, threatened, and endangered species, and organic material for the food chain.    The goal of the nontidal wetlands and waterways program is to manage nontidal wetlands and to provide essential resource protection by authorizing only necessary and unavoidable impacts. To accomplish this goal, the department regulates the following activities:        Grading or filling;         Excavating or dredging;         Changing existing drainage patterns;         Disturbing the water level or water table; and,         Destroying or removing vegetation.          A permit is required for any activity that alters a nontidal wetland or its 25-foot buffer. The 25-foot buffer is expanded to 100 feet for wetlands of special state concern as defined in COMAR 26.23.06. Applicants are required to demonstrate that proposed impacts to nontidal wetlands are necessary and unavoidable. The application review process first eliminates, then reduces impacts through avoidance and minimization. An alternatives analysis may be required as part of this process. Mitigation is required for all authorized impacts. Wetland mitigation monitoring is required and will extend beyond construction of an approved mitigation project. such as swamps, bogs, marshes, bottomlands, and woodlands, their buffer zones, and nontidal waterways, including the 100-year flood plain.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of the Environment      Tidal Wetlands Program    MDE administers the Tidal Wetlands Program. Tidal wetlands in Maryland are classified as state or private wetlands. State wetlands include all of the land and open water situated below the mean high water line (average high tide). The State of Maryland owns these wetlands and they are held in trust for all citizens of the State. Private wetlands are the lands above the mean high water line that are subject to the periodic rise and fall of the tide and support aquatic plants. Most tidal wetlands are state wetlands.    If a project involves filling, dredging, or discharging stormwater in tidal wetlands, Maryland Tidal Wetland Law requires a license or permit from the State of Maryland. Examples of projects that need permits or licenses include: bulkheads, stone revetments, large piers, dredging, and boat ramps. Licenses are issued by MDE or the Board of Public Works for work in state wetlands and permits are issued by MDE for work in private wetlands. Permits and licenses are obtained by submitting a completed joint application to the MDE Permit Service Center. Maryland's tidal wetland law requires protection of tidal wetlands but also allows for reasonable access to waterways and protection of property from erosion.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of the Environment      Shore Erosion Control Program    The DNR Shore Erosion Control Program was established in 1968 by act of the Maryland General Assembly for the purpose of addressing shoreline and streambank erosion problems along the Chesapeake Bay and it’s tributaries.    There are approximately 4,360 miles of tidal shoreline within the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. One thousand three hundred miles of tidal shoreline have been identified as eroding at various yearly rates. In addition, approximately 14,063 miles of fresh water streams, an integral part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed system, are experiencing intermittent erosion problems. Shoreline and streambank erosion not only result in the loss of land and the reduction of riparian buffer areas and wildlife habitat, but are identified as major contributors of sediment to the waters of Maryland. Approximately 5.1 million cubic yards of sediment are delivered annually to the Chesapeake Bay from these sources. Sedimentation increases nutrient pollution and degrades water quality. The Shore Erosion Control Program provides assistance to Maryland property owners in resolving shoreline and streambank erosion problems. Since 1968, the program has assisted numerous property owners and established more than 800 structural projects and 325 non-structural projects. Property owners in Maryland can request technical assistance and financial assistance from the Shore Erosion Control Program. Shore erosion control projects require authorization from the MDE’s Tidal Wetlands Division.    Projects are designed to protect eroding shorelines, to retain established vegetative buffer areas, to act as filter systems and to prevent nutrient laden sediments from the entering waters of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of Natural Resources      Chesapeake Bay Critical Areas Program    The Critical Area regulations under MD. REGS. CODE tit.27 27.01.02.03D(3) requires that activities in the Intensely Developed Area (IDA) land use category be designed in such a manner that nonpoint source pollutant loadings from stormwater runoff are reduced by 10% of predevelopment pollutant loadings (""10% rule""). To meet this requirement, a developer may use monitoring but usually uses a mathematical model developed for the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission (CBCAC) by the Washington Metropolitan Council of Governments that predicts loadings of a keystone pollutant (i.e. phosphorous) in stormwater. Based on the results of the model, the developer must use stormwater best management practices to meet the 10% reduction requirement. The 10% rule is required for all new development and redevelopment proposed in IDA's.    The CBCAC has direct approval authority over state projects. On State land, the 10% rule is required in areas of intense development, including new and expanded marinas, just as it is on private land. The Critical Area Criteria also establish a significant list of standards for development within Limited Development Areas (LDAs) and Resource Conservation Areas (RCAs). The standards include limits on impervious surfaces, limits on clearing, a prohibition on development on steep slopes and also, with regard to RCAs, a strict one dwelling unit per twenty acre density limitation. These standards were established to meet the goals of the Critical Area Program, one of which is ""to minimize adverse impacts on water quality that results from pollutants that are discharged from structures or conveyances or that have run off from surrounding lands.""      MDE has worked with the City of Baltimore in trying to assess marina flushing and water quality issues in Baltimore Harbor and has also researched flushing dynamics and water quality in various areas of the Chesapeake Bay.          Lead Agency: Local planning offices, along with the Critical Area   Commission and the Maryland Department of the Environment      Cost-Share Programs    State Water Quality Infrastructure Program    The Water Quality Infrastructure Program, managed by MDE, is responsible for the development of capital expenditure programs to improve water quality. The Program helps local governments secure funding, plan, design and construct capital projects such as water and wastewater treatment plants, collection and distribution systems, and pumping stations. There are six fund sources: the Biological Nutrient Removal Cost-Share Program; the Maryland Water Quality Revolving-Loan Fund; the Small Creeks and Estuaries Restoration Cost-Share Program; the Stormwater Pollution Control Cost-Share Program; the Supplemental Assistance Program; and the Water Supply Financial Assistance Program.      This program also maintains a tracking system for MDE capital improvement projects, reviews and approves county water and sewer plans, and administers grant and loan payments and engineering contracts of projects funded by the program.          Lead Agency: Maryland Department of the Environment      Maryland Stormwater Pollution Control Cost-Share Program    MDE administers the Maryland Stormwater Pollution Control Cost-Share Program which offers financial assistance to local governments for the installation of stormwater BMPs in existing urban areas. The proposed project must demonstrate that it will provide water quality benefits.      The cost-share program funds projects such as stormwater wetlands, infiltration basins, infiltration trenches, vegetated swales, extended detention ponds, bioretention basins, and other innovative structures.        Lead Agency: Maryland Department of the Environment      Water Quality Revolving Loan Fund    MDE administers the Maryland Water Quality Revolving Loan Fund Program for the purpose of assisting in the financing of water pollution control projects to ensure compliance with federal and state requirements, and to enhance water quality at publicly owned wastewater facilities. Both point source and nonpoint source pollution control projects are funded by the Program. For more information see Chapter V - Publi"

Call upon Clean Marina staff or the Marine Trades Association of Maryland (410-2690741) for assistance if any questions arise as you complete the self-assessment. All program materials are available by calling 410-260-8770 or can be downloaded from www.dnr.state.md.us/boating Once you feel you meet the minimum score for each section, call the Clean Marina office to schedule a confirmation visit. During the confirmation visit, a member of the Clean Marina staff and a member of the advisory committee will verify the items on the Award Checklist. With a successful confirmation visit your facility would become a certified Clean Marina. Frequently Asked Questions about the Clean Marina Initiative Q: Do I need to invest in expensive equipment like a recycling power wash system to become a certified Clean Marina? A: No, it is not necessary to spend a lot of money on fancy equipment to become a certified Clean Marina. There are really only two requirements: that you be in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations and that you meet the minimum score for each section of the Award Checklist. Other than these two requirements, the program is very flexible. For example, we ask that you remove visible solids from pressure wash water (this is a condition of the General Permit for Discharges from Marinas). How you remove the solids is up to you. You could direct the wastewater through hay bales or filter fabric, allow the solids to settle out in some sort of a holding tank, filter and reuse the water in a recycling power wash system, et cetera. The decision is up to you. We are satisfied as long as you are taking steps to prevent pollution.  GRANT  FROM THE CHESAPEAKE BAY TRUST  C  ONGRATULATIONS TO CROCKETT BROTHERS BOATYARD  ,M  AGOTHY MARINA, AND LOCUST POINT MARINA  !  The Chesapeake Bay Trust awarded the Clean Marina Initiative a grant to produce and distribute educational materials for boaters. Call Donna Morrow at 410-260-8773 to order a complimentary supply of clean boating tip cards and oil absorbent pads for your customers.  Thanks to a grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Maryland Clean Marina Initiative has selected nine marinas to receive cost-share assistance. The funds will be used to cover 75 percent of the costs associated with purchasing and installing equipment such as recycling pressure wash systems, fish cleaning stations connected to sanitary sewers, and vacuum sanders. The marinas are all in priority watersheds identified by an interagency committee as being in need of restoration: Isle of Wight Bay, South River, and Upper Elk River. The lucky marinas are Pines Point Marina, Ocean City Travel Lift, South River Marina, Turkey Point Marina, Liberty Marina, Triton Marina, Elk Point Marina, The Cove, and Locust Point. Pending Congress approval of the year 2000 federal budget, we hope to be able to offer cost-share assistance to facilities in the Baltimore Harbor, Severn River, West Chesapeake Bay, and Lower Choptank watersheds. Information about the grant program will be distributed as soon as more details are known. Solutions, from page 1 Customers leave their fish cleaning scraps in a standard metal trash barrel (with a lid!) next to the fish cleaning station at Londontowne marina.  Grant Funds Awarded to Nine Marinas  Crockett Brothers Boatyard in Oxford, Magothy Marina in Severna Park, and Locust Point Marina in Elkton are the newest certified Clean Marinas. They have all met the Clean Marina criteria by incorporating pollution prevention measures into their daily operations. For example, Philip Conner, owner of Crockett Brothers, is working with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation to raise oysters on a float suspended from a pier. After tending to the oysters for about a year, the young oysters are transplanted to a non-harvested bed where they help to filter the Chesapeake Bay. When the pumpout system at Magothy Marina broke this past summer, manager and president Victoria Shiroky gave her customers coupons for a free pumpout at a later date and directed them to the next closest pumpout. The coupons helped to alleviate some of the frustration felt by boaters with full holding tanks. Also, the coupons encouraged boaters to continue to properly dispose of their sewage. Bill and Reji Descheemaeker, owners of Locust Point Marina, have constructed a wash down pad to filter wash water runoff. A hydraulic lift carries boats about 100 feet from the water to a concrete pad which is curbed on three sides. The fourth side is bound with filter fabric. Pressure wash water flows out through the filter fabric and then into a gravel lot. The fabric catches most of the large particles dislodged by pressure washing . In recognition of their commitment to environmental stewardship, Clean Marina staff present operators of approved Clean Marinas with certificates signed by Governor Glendening . The certificates read, in part, This marina meets the rigorous pollution prevention standards established by the Maryland Clean Marina Committee and the Department of Natural Resources. The operators have voluntarily adopted measures to control pollution associated with marina operations and stand as a notable example of the conservation ethic: individual responsibility for healthy land and water.

It is not possible to predict definitively what EPA and NOAA will require if the Clean Marina Initiative fails to reach the goal of 25 percent of Maryland marinas as Clean Marinas by 2004. It is likely, however, that the federal agencies will put pressure on the State to implement more formal pollution control measures. The areas most likely to be considered for new regulations if the 25 percent goal is not achieved are petroleum, liquid waste (e.g., antifreeze and solvents), fish scrap disposal, and boat cleaning practices.  Odor is not the problem that many people expect it to be. In fact, there was no odor at all on the warm, sunny day that I visited Londontowne. Furthermore, Glenda has never had any trouble with animals, such as dogs or racoons, digging in the compost pits. For further information about how to get started, call Glenda Felmey at 410-956-5077.

Open-house events at marinas are scheduled each year to Inside this Issue... demonstrate pollution prevention equipment and projects. A fourth round of grant funding has also recently begun, A Letter from the Departing Program Coordinator 2 but is limited by federal requirements to the following First National Clean Marina Conference 2 watersheds: Isle of Wight Bay, Newport Bay, Chincoteague Bay, Seven New Clean Marinas! 3 Middle Chester River, Sassafras River, and Stillpond-Fairlee Tier II Reminder for Fuel Dock Operators 4 Creek. Notice of this funding was sent directly to marinas located within these watersheds, and was announced through press Continued on page 2  1   Continued from Page 1 releases and on the Clean Marina web page. The application deadline was December 13, 2002 and the project period is January to September of 2003. Six marinas submitted applications and all received some or all of the items requested. From the Coastal Bays watershed were: Advanced Marine, Bahia Marina, and Sunset Marina. From the Middle Chester River/Still Pond/Fairlee Creek watersheds were: Mears Great Oak Landing , The Wharf at Handy 's Point, and Worton Creek Marina. A small amount of grant funding remains available to marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs in these selected watersheds. Interested applicants should contact Donna Morrow at 410-260-8773. This is the only grant opportunity the Clean Marina program has available at this time. Any future opportunities will be announced through direct mailings, the clean marina web site, and press releases to regional newspapers. However, grants for Pumpout stations, which are managed through a separate program, remain available by contacting Don O'Neill at 410-260-8772. ]  A Letter From the Departing Program Coordinator The Maryland Clean Marina Initiative is underway and going strong . Over the past five years I have worked with a fantastic group of peoplefrom the marine industry, government, and environmental communitiesto pilot the program from inception to its current status as a nationally recognized model of industry and government working together to prevent pollution. As I prepare to leave DNR (and return home to New England) I do so knowing that Maryland marinas, boatyards and yacht clubs are at the forefront of efforts to protect our waterways. The Maryland Clean Marina Initiative was formally launched in January 1999 with a series of introductory workshops held around the state. Since that time, 66 facilities have adopted pollution prevention measures in excess of basic legal requirements and been certified as Clean Marinas or Clean Marina Partners. In order to satisfy federal requirements, another 84 facilities need to be certified by December 2004. Considering that 97 additional facilities have already pledged to ""protect Maryland's waterways from harmful chemicals, excess nutrients, and debris,"" this level of certification should be readily achievable. The burden is now on the pledged facilities to fulfill their commitment, and on those marinas, boatyards and yacht clubs that have yet to sign the pledge. If every boating facility in Maryland would adopt the common-sense pollution prevention measures advocated by the Clean Marina Initiative the results would be profound. Water quality would be enhanced, businesses would operate more efficiently, the marine industry could avoid further regulation, and concern for the environment would be integral to the actions of yard workers and boaters alike. A colleague told me recently that a single boat represents up to 60 boaters when the owner 's family, friends and business associates are considered. In Maryland, there are about 60,000 registered boats over 22 feet in length. If we assume that most of these are kept in the water and we use a conservative estimate of 10 boaters per boat, then marina and yacht club operators have the potential to influence 600,000 individuals. By following Clean Marina practices and distributing materials such as oil absorbent pads, marina operators convey the message that good water quality is everybody 's responsibility. I hope we have started a gentle revolution. A revolution in attitude that results in a future in which it is no longer necessary to remind people to slow down at the fuel pump or to avoid caustic cleaners. I further hope that consumer demand for environmentally-responsible products will lead to the rapid introduction of technological solutions to protect our waterways. For example, all new boats could come equipped with fuel/air separators to prevent spills at the fuel dock and non-toxic, quick-release bottom paints could be perfected and made broadly available. This future is possible if we are willing to demonstrate, rather than just voice, our support for clean water. It has been a privilege and a pleasure to work on the Clean Marina Initiative. I leave management of the program in the very capable hands of Donna Morrow who has worked on the Clean Marina Initiative since April 1998. The ultimate success of the program, however, lies with those of you who have the most to gain from its success: the owners and managers of marinas, boatyards and yacht clubs. Good luck! ]  Seven New Clean Marinas and Boatyards! More than a half dozen facilities have been certified as Clean Marinas since the last issue of Underway was published. Campbell's Town Creek (Oxford), Harborview Yacht Club and Marina (Leonardtown), Casa Rio Marina (Mayo), Town Point Marina (Tracy 's Landing), Selby Bay Yacht Basin (Edgewater), Oak Grove Marine Center (Edgewater), and Persimmon Point Marine (Edgewater) all adopted measures to minimize pollution and educate their customers about clean boating habits. ""This yard, because of its age and condition when we took over, needed some real TLC,"" said Tom Campbell, of Campbell's Town Creek Boatyard. ""We upgraded the bathrooms, which our customers were thrilled about, and also looked at our entire operation to find ways to control run-off and deal with the Susan Campbell with the award for paints and solvents we use,"" added Susan Campbell. Campbell's Town Creek Boatyard in Campbell's Town Creek Boatyard features approximately 40 Oxford. wet slips and a full service boatyard. This is an older boatyard that, while quite small, offers a full range of high quality services. Harbor View Yacht Club and Marina is a small marina with just 13 slips along Breton Bay (off the Potomac River). The owner, Philip Dorsey, maintains a clean facility by using a variety of plants and grass to help filter stormwater and by making oil absorbent cloths available to his customers in an unlocked dock box. ""The marina is used by my own family and friends,"" said Mr. Dorsey. ""I take a lot of pride in keeping the grounds as clean and pretty as possible."" ""The changes we made here to protect the environment also improved our business,"" said former Casa Rio Marina owner Don Dunbar. Placing filter fabric under all vessels being scraped Stephanie accepts the award for or sanded on land, training employees in emergency procedures, and removing unused oil Harbor View Yacht Club and Marina tanks are among the changes instituted by Dunbar and manager Richard Maldeis. New owners in Leonardtown. Bill Finlay and Susan Climie have embraced the program and have backed Maldeis completely in his efforts to minimize pollution. ""As part of our Clean Marina certification, we created an oil spill response kit complete with oil absorbent pads and booms so that we can be prepared for big and small spills,"" said Ned Crandell, owner of Town Point Marina. ""In addition to the kit itself, I built an enclosure for relatively little money to protect the items and to ensure that everybody knows where the spill response materials are located."" Town Point Marina also encourages customers to be environmentally-conscious by distributing educational materials and posting signs urging patrons to conserve water. ""We strengthened our fuel dock rules as part of our effort to achieve the Clean Marina certification,"" said Selby Bay Yacht Basin owner Theodore Peterson. ""Now, all customers use oil absorbent pads or `no-spill' jugs to catch incidental fuel spills."" Mr. Peterson also established a new area for pressure washing boats. The site is well away from the water's edge and is covered in filter fabric to prevent particles and debris dislodged by pressure washing from Ned Crandell accepts the award for Town Point Marina in Tracy's Landing. Mr. running into the river. Crandell and his wife, Betty, worked Oak Grove Marine Center on the South together to earn the award. River has 130 wet slips and room to store about 90 boats in its boatel. Persimmon Point Marine is the on- site contractor specializing in mechanical repairs. Both facilities implemented changes to achieve Clean Marina certification. For example, Oak Grove owner Sid French and manager Gregg Rodgers enhanced employee training with regard to environmental precautions, established a fuel spill response kit and improved signage at the fuel dock. Alex Govatos, owner of Persimmon Point Marine, From Oak Grove Marina and Persimmon Point developed a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, encircled the pressure wash Marine are (L-R) : Dave French, Gregg Rodgers, area with filter fabric to capture debris released by washing and also enhanced Alex Gavatos, and Sid French with their award. his employee training . ]  First National Clean Marina Conference The first national Clean Marina Conference was held in Mystic, Conneticut in September. Approximately 100 participants, representing at least a dozen states or regions, attended. The staff of the Maryland program was invited to make a presentation. Hosted by the Marine Environmental Education Foundation (MEEF), the conference explored the many different ways such programs have been organized in different states or regions, and offered excellent information for emerging programs. Through a short survey, and consensus building talks both at the beginning and end of the conference, participants agreed that the basic criteria for certifying clean marinas should be uniformly used in all programs. At a minimum, it was agreed that certified clean marinas would be facilities that have voluntarily exceeded their basic regulatory requirements and implemented pollution prevention measures in suitable areas of their operations. Moreover, the group felt that an independent national clean marina program was not necessary and opted to retain local identity and connection to local marine industries through regional programs.

GX025-83-8859054	The Environment and Agriculture        by  Peter Yurich , Ha Khayensti, Lesotho    In my area there does not seem to be any major changes.  The water taps from the spring boxes on the mountain has brought the water to the villages and it is easier to get.  If the taps are not working, then getting water is a problem because of the distance one has to carry it.  The animals are taken to the river to drink.  But right now the river has very little water.        by  MaryAnn Camp , Ha Rantubu, Lesotho    I have not been aware of any technological advancements in my local village.  In my previous village my tutor told me of times before the wells were installed--10 years ago.  They had to walk five miles to a small pond that had an inlet and outlet but was usually covered with scum.  She said they scraped off the scum, dug down into the sand, and waited for clean water to come through.  The installing of pumps certainly relieved much work and the health improved in the village of Ha Ralintsi.  There were reported deaths of typhoid which spurred the Health Department to install these new pumps.     One of my Peace Corps colleagues has reported to me that she is getting funding for a solar pump in her village.        by  Claire Hilger , Christ the King Mission, Qachas Nek, Lesotho    Protecting springs and providing taps has drastically improved the quality of water.  But this is only true for villages near to the road.  Remote villages still collect their water from unprotected springs or streams where cattle are likely to cross or humans even.  This advancement tends to help the already advanced few like the sisters on the mission.  The poorest most remote villages have the worst water supply.  It should be noted that water quality is generally better in Lesotho than most African countries as it is too cold for tropical diseases to be prevalent.  Giardia, a one-celled protozoa that causes diarrhea, is present in the water.        by  Cynthia Holahan , Ha Nkoka, Thaba-Tseka District, Lesotho    I guess the advancement of new technology has helped to improve the quality of water in my village.  I have been told that before the present water system was installed people collected water from natural springs that were often very dirty, slow and unreliable.  People often walked over two kilometers to find a full spring.  If no spring had water, they would use water form the river that often caused people to become sick, especially during the dry season.        by  Becki Krieg , Qachas Nek, Lesotho    The farmers in Lesotho depend entirely on natural rain for their crops to grow.  In my village there is one farmer who received foreign aid to set up some irrigation pipes.  He is very lucky.  However, he is only one farmer out of many in this country who have no irrigation.  Also, his farmland is very small.     To add to his difficulties, he has very little money to maintain his new irrigation system.  If anything breaks, he does not have the money to repair it now.  Then he too will depend on nature like everyone else.     Foreign aid is readily available in Lesotho.  However, there is usually no plan for the maintenance of the new technology foreign countries install.  Either the money is not available for repairs or there is no skilled person to do the work.  Also it is difficult to get the parts that are needed to repair equipment        by  Amy Bratsch ,  Ha Thamere-Qutin-Mt.Moorosi, Lesotho    The quality of water has not changed since I have lived here.  The big advancement was the placement of another water tap.  However, both taps are regulated the same and provide water on the same day at the same time.  The big improvement was in the length of lines of people waiting to get water.        by  JeanMarie Mitchell , Ha Tebelo, Lesotho    In Lesotho soil erosion is a major problem in the environment.  Only 12%  of the land here is arable, but farming exists everywhere.  Grazing animals is another huge problem as well.  Cattle just roam the lands going anywhere and everywhere.  With the mountainous terrain and heavy winds and when there is rain, the soil is just all washed away down into deep rifts.  They are everywhere and so much water just washes down them with good topsoil.  Maybe in some places there is a dam to catch water into a pool, but they are few and far-between.  The one near my village has been dry since April.  The water comes down from the main springs.  Most of the time it is good, but after a heavy rain, it is brown and very unclean.  Rural Water Supply is a part of the Water Affairs Department that is responsible for supplying/ensuring villages in rural areas have potable water.  However, there is a one per district and once your village applies for a well or tap it may take five years to receive it.

Maryland's CPP explains the processes the State uses to administer its water programs. Also, the CPP describes the methodology to develop plans to protect, maintain, and improve the quality of the State's waters. Maryland's CPP document was approved by the EPA in 1976. This document updates Maryland's existing CPP, which was submitted to, and reviewed by the EPA in 1986.  1.2  NEED FOR THE REVISION OF CONTINUING PLANNING PROCESS DOCUMENT  Since the last revision of Maryland's CPP document in 1986, a major reorganization of the State's environmental regulatory programs and Chesapeake Bay-related water quality monitoring and assessment programs has occurred. The consolidation of environmental regulatory programs within the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and Chesapeake Bay-related water quality planning, monitoring and assessment programs within the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) became effective on July 1, 1995. Now that the reorganization has been completed, it is appropriate that Maryland's CPP be reviewed and updated to reflect the policy, programmatic, and organizational changes that have resulted. The CPP described in this report is multi-year in scope. It is anticipated that changes in direction and organization will occur in the future as the State's water quality management program continues to evolve. The CPP document will be revised periodically to reflect such changes as necessary.  1.3  PURPOSE AND ORGANIZATION OF CPP  Each state is required to establish and maintain a CPP for water quality management as described under Section 303(e) of the CWA. Maryland's CPP provides a description of the processes the State uses to administer its water programs and to develop plans to protect, maintain, and improve the quality of the State's waters. In accordance with 40 CFR 130.5, the CPP document must describe how Maryland:  MDE  1 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment            develops effluent limits & schedules of compliance incorporates the relevant strategies discussed in the area-wide ""waste treatment plans"" and ""basin plans"" develops Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) updates and maintain Water Quality Management (WQM) plans seeks intergovernmental cooperation establishes and implements new or revised water quality standards, including schedules of compliance assures adequate controls over the residual waste from any water treatment processing explains the construction needs for wastewater treatment determines the priority of permit issuance  Maryland's CPP also includes, several examples of Maryland's proactive approach to managing water quality, that go beyond the minimum elements of the CPP. The above mentioned issues are discussed in Chapter 3.0 of this document. In accordance with 40 CFR 130.7 (a) and 40 CFR 130.7 (c), Maryland's CPP document must describe how the state involves the general public in its program. Public involvement process is discussed in Chapter 4.0 of this document.  1.4  REPORT DISTRIBUTION  The MDE plans to make copies of the CPP document widely available to State, regional, and local agencies, elected officials, special interest groups, and to the general public. As required by 40 CFR 130.5, Maryland's CPP document will be submitted to the Regional Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III for review.  1.5  PARTICIPATING AGENCY  In addition to the MDE, there are several agencies involved in the CPP process. These agencies include, DNR, Maryland Department of Agriculture, Maryland Office of Planning, Maryland Department of Health & Mental Hygiene, local governments, etc. Also, see Section 3.5 of this document for more information.  MDE  2 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  CHAPTER 2.0 MAJOR GOALS OF THE CONTINUING PLANNING PROCESS  2.1  FEDERAL AND STATE MANDATES (PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT)  Water quality planning and management in Maryland are guided by a set of major goals that are embodied in federal and State laws. For more than 25 years, the federal Clean Water Act (enacted 1972, amended in 1977, 1981, and 1987) has provided the foundation for our Nation's water pollution control programs. Pre-existing State and federal programs were completely overhauled after its passage, and major new programs for water pollution control and water quality planning were established. In addition to the national agenda for restoring and maintaining water quality, the federal government has given special recognition to the Chesapeake Bay as a natural resource of major significance (Section 117 of the CWA). Also, federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was established to protect the quality of drinking water in the US (42 USC 300f-300j-26). This law focuses on all waters actually or potentially designated for drinking use, whether from above ground or underground sources. This act authorized EPA to establish safe standards of purity and required all owners or operators of public water systems to comply with primary (health-related) standards. State governments, which assume this power from EPA, also encourage attainment of secondary standards (nuisance-related). The year 1983 marked the end of an intensive period of Bay research conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the beginning of a landmark effort to correct environmental problems identified by the EPA studies. With the signing of the 1983 Chesapeake Bay Agreement by Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and the EPA, a commitment was made to implement coordinated plans to improve and protect the water quality and living resources of the Bay. To initiate this effort, federal funds earmarked for Bay implementation actions and long-term resource management became available during 1984. In 1984, the Maryland General Assembly enacted a unique environmental program with major financial commitment to carry out the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. The general goal of this program is to restore the Bay to the condition that existed in the 1950s. To accomplish this goal, the program is designed to improve the quality of the Bay and the management of its resources by controlling pollution, restoring aquatic and land resources, and protecting shorelines from erosion and sediment runoff. In terms of State law that existed prior to 1984, the following major statements of policy relating to protection of the State's waters still apply today (as taken from the Annotated Code of Maryland):  ""...it is State policy to improve, conserve, and manage the quality of the waters of the State and protect, maintain, and improve the quality of waters for public supplies, propagation of wildlife, and domestic, agricultural, industrial, recreational, and other legitimate beneficial uses. Also, it is State public policy to provide that no waste is discharged into  MDE  3 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  the any waters of this State without first receiving necessary treatment or other corrective action to protect the legitimate beneficial uses of this State's waters, and provide for prevention, abatement, and control of new or existing water pollution.  Many of the rivers of Maryland or portions of them and related adjacent land areas possess outstanding scenic, fish, wildlife, and other recreation values of present and potential benefit to the citizens of the State. The policy of the State is to protect the water quality of these rivers and fulfill vital conservation purposes by wise use of resources within the scenic river system. The General Assembly finds that the management of stormwater runoff is necessary to reduce stream channel erosion, pollution, siltation and sedimentation, and local flooding, all of which have adverse impacts on the water and land resources of Maryland.""    In addition, Maryland's Governors have issued executive orders that declare goals and policies for environmental management, including water quality protection. An example of this is the order that contains policies to guide State actions for physical and economic development. With respect to water quality, the order states: ...it is State policy to protect the quality and productivity of the Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries, and other water bodies of the State, and groundwater resources. The 1997 General Assembly adopted several specific programs, which form the Smart Growth Initiatives. Collectively, these initiatives aim to direct State resources to revitalize older developed areas, preserve some of Maryland's valuable resource and open space lands, and discourage the continuation of sprawling development into our rural areas. The Smart Growth legislation allows the State to direct its programs and funding to support locally-designated growth areas and protect rural areas. This landmark legislation's passage is a significant accomplishment, which will play a major role in Maryland's efforts to better manage land use and growth. The Maryland General Assembly passed the Water Quality Improvement Act (WQIA) of 1998 during the closing hours of the session. The WQIA of 1998 offers many challenges for agricultural and environmental interests in Maryland. It represents a major change in MDE's approach to controlling agricultural nutrient pollution. The most far-reaching requirement of the WQIA is that all agricultural operations with annual incomes greater than $2,500 or more than eight animal units (one animal unit equals 1,000 pounds live weight) must have and implement a nitrogen- and phosphorus-based nutrient management plan by a prescribed date. The Act requires that anyone ""who in operating a farm, uses chemical fertilizer"" must have a nitrogen- and phosphorus-based plan by December 31, 2001, which must be implemented by December 31, 2002. With regard to persons using sludge or animal manure, they have until July 1, 2004, to submit a nitrogen- and phosphorus-based nutrient management plan, which must be implemented by July 1, 2005. Lastly, State agencies can adopt policy statements and develop strategies that, although lacking the legal strength of State law or regulation, can have a major influence over the actual implementation of MDE  4 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  State programs affecting water management.  2.2  PROGRAM GOALS OF THE STATE'S CONTINUING PLANNING PROCESS  In response to federal directives and existing State laws and policies, Maryland has framed current program goals as part of the Continuing Planning Process for water quality planning and management. These goals, listed below, address the major water quality issues that underlie the State's central water quality program: Goal 1 Water Quality Standards: Maintain a set of water quality standards that provide for the protection of public health and aquatic life and support the goals established by federal and State law. Comprehensive Watershed Management: Maintain a program of comprehensive water quality planning and management for each of the major river basins in the State. Chesapeake Bay Program: Direct and enhance State water quality program efforts in support of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. Maximize the use of federal resources available for Bay cleanup efforts. Point Source Pollution: Ensure levels of wastewater treatment that will allow compliance with established water quality standards and will permit attainment of recognized beneficial uses for the State's waters. Ensure adequate conveyance facilities for sewage, allowing for present and future needs (see the discussion at the end of this Section on Point Source Pollution). Nonpoint Source Pollution: Support the continued enhancement of an integrated strategy to adequately address nonpoint sources of pollution with stronger emphasis on the mitigation of nutrient enrichment of the State's waters (see the discussion at the end of this Section on Nonpoint Source Pollution).. Water Supply: Ensure the provision of adequate supplies of high quality drinking water for the citizens of the State. Ensure adequate treatment and distribution facilities, allowing for present and future needs. Groundwater: Ensure adequate protection of the State's groundwater resources. Aquatic Resources: Support the restoration or creation of viable communities of diverse aquatic plant and animal species through the application of appropriate water quality standards and subsequent control of recognized pollutants. Research: Further develop a research program that addresses both short-range and 5 of 46 06/23/00  Goal 2  Goal 3  Goal 4  Goal 5  Goal 6  Goal 7 Goal 8  Goal 9 MDE   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  long-range water quality issues for which State policies, programs, and regulatory actions are needed. Goal 10 Monitoring and Database Management: Maintain a compliance and water quality monitoring program, and a database management program, to be used to store and analyze data that will allow the State to effectively: (1) protect public health; (2) characterize the general quality of the State's waters; (3) develop wasteload allocations for discharges to specific waterbodies and ensure compliance with State water quality management strategies and policies; and (4) evaluate effectiveness of management program. Special Water Quality Problems: Investigate special water quality problems and, when necessary, develop management programs to address those problems. An example of ""Special Water Quality Problems"" is the fish kill episode in Pocomoke River due to the presence of potentially toxic estuarine microorganism Pfiesteria piscicida1 Local Government and Public Involvement: Encourage meaningful involvement of the public in water quality management issues and in local cleanup efforts. Provide for cooperation with and support of local environmental programs impacting water quality. Local government and public involvement issues are further discussed in Sections 3.9 and Chapter 4.0 respectively.  Goal 11  Goal 12  Discussion on Point and Nonpoint Source Pollutions Point Sources: Point sources are managed by MDE through the issuance of a written permit, which describes the characteristics of what may be discharged by the point source. There are a variety of different categories of permits, briefly described below. Most of these point source permits are more formally known as federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) discharge permits.  Point sources of certain well-defined types, such as the specific industry categories of mining, seafood processing, and others may receive a ""general permit."" A general permit specifies uniform rules by which all point sources of a certain type are to manage their discharge. Other point sources, for which it has been determined that a discharge will not adversely affect water quality, may receive technology-based permit requirements. These permits include limits which require appropriate technology-based controls for various industrial processes or municipal waste, required by Sections 301(b), 306, 307, or other Sections of CWA.  1  Beginning in October 1996, and again in the spring and summer of 1997, fish with unusual and disturbing deep, bloody lesions were reportedly being taken from the Pocomoke River, located on Maryland's lower Eastern Shore. Pfiesteria was identified as the cause of the problem. More information can be found in MDE's website (www.mde.state.md.us/reference/factsheets/pfiesteria.html).  MDE  6 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  If effluent-based control limits are insufficient to assure that water quality standards will be met in the receiving water body, water quality-based effluent limits are also necessary. These limits are tailored with respect to the receiving water body to which the point source will discharge. Nonpoint Sources: In part, due to their diffuse nature, nonpoint sources are managed through a wide array of regulatory and non-regulatory means. The state has formed innovative partnerships with the federal government, neighboring states, local governments, private businesses and the public to improve watershed health. Major watershed initiatives include: the Chesapeake Bay Program, the Anacostia River Initiative, the Coastal Bays Program, the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin and the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Program. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) oversees the State's nonpoint sources pollution control planning process. More information describing Maryland's framework for managing nonpoint sources of pollution may be found in a document entitled ""Maryland's Nonpoint Source Management Plan (MNPSMP),"" developed in response to the Section 319 of the CWA and Section 6217 of the federal Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990. The MNPSMP was approved by EPA in April 2000. The Statewide MNPSMP Update is a comprehensive guide to the State's nonpoint source problems, pollution control programs, and future step for nonpoint source pollution control and prevention. This Plan updates the ""Nonpoint Source Pollution Management Program,"" prepared in April 1989. Maryland assembled this document in accordance with guidance contained in the Nonpoint Source Program and Grants Guidance for Fiscal Year 1997 and Future Years and the Final Administrative Changes to the Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program Guidance. The document was developed to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) requirements, but was also written for the public to describe what is being done in Maryland to control or prevent nonpoint source pollution. The report is broken down into six chapters: Introduction, Resource Assessment and Monitoring, Watershed Management Programs and Initiatives, NPS Programs and Initiatives, Public Outreach and Assistance Programs, and Future Directions. The NPS Programs and Initiatives chapter is the core component of the MNPSMP document. This chapter is divided into the following nonpoint source pollution categories: agriculture, developed lands, forestry, marinas and recreational boating, hydromodification, wetlands, atmospheric deposition, and mining. Maryland's Nonpoint Source Management Plan Update was developed by Nonpoint Source Program staff in close cooperation with State and local nonpoint source program managers. Throughout the entire process these program managers were consulted so that the Management Plan contains the most current information on nonpoint source pollution control programs and their long and short term goals. The entire text version of this document can be found in DNR's website (www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/czm/nps)  2.3  COORDINATION OF MARYLAND'S WATERSHED RESTORATION AND PROTECTION INITIATIVES  MDE  7 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  In developing the Chesapeake Bay Agreement and working to achieve their commitments under that agreement and subsequent directives of the Chesapeake Bay Executive Council (CEC), Maryland and the other signatory jurisdictions have built upon ongoing efforts, including both voluntary programs and legally mandated regulatory programs. Likewise, in developing its Clean Water Action Plan (CWAP), Maryland has endeavored to build upon ongoing efforts such as the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, and Clean Water Act mandated environmental monitoring, assessment and regulatory efforts. This has led to some confusion regarding the apparently overlapping goals and mandates of CWAP, Chesapeake Bay Agreement commitments, and Clean Water Act mandates, most notably with regard to Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirements. This Section of Maryland's CPP defines each of those programs and then describes how they are related to each other. 2.3.1 Clean Water Action Plan  The Clean Water Action Plan was unveiled by President Clinton in February 1998. The Action Plan proposes a new collaborative effort by state, federal, and local governments, the private sector and the public to restore those watersheds not meeting clean water and other natural resource goals and to sustain healthy conditions in watersheds that currently meet these goals. The Clean Water Action Plan addresses all aspects of watershed condition: water quality, including public health issues; aquatic living resources; physical habitat and the landscape. The key steps in this national effort are:  Unified Watershed Assessment - The Unified Watershed Assessment (UWA) uses the best available information to assess the condition of each State's watersheds, identify watersheds in need of restoration, identify watersheds that need preventive action to sustain water quality and aquatic resources, and identify pristine or sensitive watersheds that need extra protection Watershed Restoration Priorities - Based on the UWA, States will establish watershed restoration priorities by October 1998. This involves selecting those watersheds not meeting clean water and other natural resource goals that are most in need of restoration actions during the next two years. Watershed Restoration Action Strategies - will identify the most important causes of water pollution and resource degradation, detail the actions needed to address these problems, and set milestones by which to measure progress. Funds made available to federal agencies through the federal FY 1999 Clean Water and Watershed Restoration Budget Initiative will be used to help States implement these strategies.      This report ""Maryland Clean Water Action Plan"" (December 31, 1998 describes Maryland's Unified Watershed Assessment, Watershed Restoration Priorities and the process to develop and implement Watershed Restoration Action Strategies. It was prepared by the Maryland Clean Water Action Plan Technical Workgroup2 and subject to policy review by a group including Maryland's Chesapeake Bay Cabinet Secretaries and the Maryland Natural Resource Conservation Service State Conservationist. Comments received from other local governments, State and federal agencies, interest 2  The workgroup included a diverse group of interests: State agencies, local governments, Tributary Teams, environmental and watershed organizations, the Farm Bureau and others.  MDE  8 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  groups and the public based on draft reports produced in August and October 1998 were considered in this revision of the report. Also, public comments received through mid-October and comments received during six regional workshops held in cooperation with the Tributary Strategies Teams in September 1998 were considered. Clean Water Action Plan is a comprehensive federal initiative begun in 1998 and designed to encourage all 50 states to assess their watersheds and develop restoration and protection action strategies to meet the specific water quality goals defined in the Clean Water Act, as well as other natural resource objectives. These are to be achieved by applying a combination of voluntary programs and legally mandated regulatory programs intended to restore and protect water quality, living resources and the watersheds on which they depend. CWAP recognizes the need for all of the states and federal government agencies to fully comply with all of the legally mandated provisions of the Clean Water Act. The CWAP attempts to bring these efforts together to comprehensively address the need for water quality management and watershed restoration and protection. CWAP is national in scope, is implemented on a state-by-state basis, and includes both water quality and living resources components for tidal and non-tidal waters. It provides federal funds for watershed restoration and assessment. 2.3.2 Restoration of Watershed Impacted by Acid Mine Drainage  Acid Mine Drainage is Maryland's most serious problem attributable to abandoned coal mines, and Western Maryland's most severe water pollution problem. Acidic waters from abandoned coal mine drainage or from atmospheric deposition in headwater streams have detrimental effects on aquatic life by smothering aquatic habitats with precipitates or through the toxic effects of low hydrogen ion concentration (pH) and high metal concentrations. The extent of many underground workings in Western Maryland made Acid Mine Drainage remediation exceedingly difficult to accomplish. After World War II, deep mining activity declined and surface coal mining increased in Western Maryland. Surface mines operated without any reclamation laws until 1955, when minimal requirements, far from satisfactory by today's standards, were enacted. As surface mining increased, new types of abandoned mine problems emerged. Highwalls, pits with standing water, spoil piles, landslide areas, erosion, and acid drainage are prevalent remnants of the abandoned surface mine problems in the coal basin of Western Maryland. In 1967 and 1969 major changes in the Maryland Strip Mining Law were enacted. Further amendments were enacted in 1972, and annually since 1974, as reclamation requirements began to resemble current regulatory program standards. More information acid mine drainage can be found in MDE's website (www.mde.state.md.us/wma/minebur). 2.3.3 Maryland Coastal Bay Program (MCBP)  On October 13, 1999, the Coastal Bays Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan was approved by the EPA and is summarized in the following paragraphs. More information on MCBP can be found at DNR's website (www.dnr.state.md.us). MDE  9 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  The Maryland coastal bays, like other coastal areas around the world, are experiencing rapid population growth and increased development. Already the bays are experiencing early warning signs of stress. Recognizing the potential for additional stress on this fragile ecosystem and the importance of a healthy ecosystem, federal, state and local government agencies joined with the people who depend on these resources for their livelihood and quality of life to develop a plan of action that will protect and restore the health of the coastal bays. The MCBP is one of 28 National Estuary Programs designated by the EPA. The MCBP has identified changes in living resources, deteriorating water quality, loss and modification of habitat, increasing chemical contamination, impacts of water based activities, and pathogen contamination as priority issues threatening the coastal bays. There were four broad goals that the Maryland Coastal Bays Program used when developing solutions, or action plans, to address the six priority environmental problems identified for the coastal bays. These goals include:     Improve the overall water quality by reducing the causes of eutrophication, and maintain the water quality in relatively unimpacted areas such as Chincoteague Bay. Protect existing habitat, restore degraded habitat and create new habitat to improve the reproduction and maintenance of healthy living resource populations. Access the impact of pathogens and toxic chemicals on living resources and control and/or mitigate those impacts. Promote ecologically sound, sustainable development in order to protect the desired uses and economic vitality of the coastal bays region. Maryland's Source Water Assessment Program  2.3.4  The 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments require states to develop and implement source water assessment programs to evaluate the safety of all public drinking water systems. States are required to develop these programs with public input and to submit draft descriptions of their programs to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by February 1999. The draft submittals must outline the methods that each state will use to define and evaluate risks to each public drinking water system. States must complete the assessments by May of 2003. Source Water Assessment is a process for evaluating the vulnerability to contamination of the source of a public drinking water supply. The assessment does not address the treatment processes, or the storage and distribution aspects of the water system, which are covered under separate provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act. There are three main steps in the assessment process: delineating the drainage area that is likely to contribute to the drinking water supply, identifying potential contaminants within that area and assessing the vulnerability of the system to those contaminants. Maryland will look at many factors when determining the vulnerability of a water supply to contamination, including the size and type of water system, the characteristics of the potential contaminants and the capacity of the natural environment to attenuate any risk. More information on Maryland's Source Water Assessment Program can be found on MDE's website (www.mde.state.md.us/health/sourcewater.html). MDE  10 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) is another agency that is playing a key role in water quality planning. WSSC is providing safe and reliable water, and taking care of wastewater in suburban Maryland that would include Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. All of the water WSSC processes is surface water and comes from the Patuxent and Potomac rivers. Treated wastewater is discharged in accordance with NPDES permit requirements. More information on WSSC can be found on the Internet (www.wssc.dst.md.us). 2.3.5 Chesapeake Bay Agreement  This is a regional initiative of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, initially signed in 1983. The original agreement was further strengthened by amendment in 1987 and in 1992. It focuses on the entire Chesapeake Bay Watershed, with the objective of achieving both water quality and living resources goals set by the Chesapeake Executive Council in the Bay Agreement and subsequent directives. The Chesapeake Bay Agreement is regional in scope, is implemented in a multi-state cooperative manner, and includes both water quality and living resources components. Maryland's nutrient reduction programs (both regulatory and voluntary) are focussed on achieving the Chesapeake Bay 40% nutrient reduction goal and are on track for success. In addition to the 40% Nutrient Reduction Goal, Maryland's Tributary Nutrient Reduction Strategies and the Executive Council Directive No 97-1 (Baywide Nutrient Reduction Progress and Future Directions), which requires the development of Protocols for establishing Priority Nutrient and Sediment Reduction Areas (PN/SRAs), are closely linked to CWAP and the TMDL effort, as described in the Section 2.3.6 of this document. A revised interim cap strategy is being developed which, when completed in January 2001, will address how to maintain the 40% reduction levels. Tributary Strategy: A Tributary Strategy is a comprehensive approach to reducing nutrient pollution in a watershed. It is developed by the state, local governments, and citizens living and working in the watershed. To achieve the 40% nutrient reduction for the state, Maryland's Chesapeake Bay3 watershed has been divided into ten major tributary watersheds (see Figure 1). These are:       3  Choptank River Lower Eastern Shore Lower Potomac River Lower Western Shore Middle Potomac River Patapsco Back River  The Chesapeake Bay Watershed is the land area drained by all the rivers and streams that flow into the Bay. Home to 14 million people, it extends 64,000 square miles and includes parts of six states and the District of Columbia. Like all large watersheds, the Bay's watershed is made up of thousands of smaller watersheds that drain into its tributaries. For example, the Monocacy River Watershed is part of the larger Potomac River Watershed, which, in turn, is part of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.  MDE  11 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment       Patuxent River Upper Eastern Shore Upper Potomac River Upper Western Shore  The Strategy is a combination of existing regulatory programs and comprehensive voluntary programs4. It includes some options we know will reduce nutrients, but don't know by how much. The Strategy is a plan for achieving the 40% nutrient reduction goal that will be fine-tuned and improved as it is implemented by the year 2000 (this year is being revised). The Strategy will reflect public, local, state, and federal government concerns, availability of resources, and the emergence of new technologies. More information on Tributary Strategies can be found in DNR website. 2.3.6 Clean Water Act and Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs)  The Clean Water Act (CWA) is a federal law that was passed in 1972. It is designed to ensure the nation's waters are maintained in a ""fishable and swimmable"" condition that is protective of public health and living resources. Among other requirements, the CWA mandates that states establish water quality standards, regularly monitor water quality and regulate discharges to those waters to ensure water quality standards are achieved and maintained. The CWA is national in scope, and it imposes certain requirements on the states, such as the development of water quality standards and TMDLs. EPA may authorize states to implement other aspects of the CWA, such as the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program. Maryland is authorized to implement the NPDES permit program within its borders. Section 303(d) of the CWA requires states to identify waters which do not meet applicable water quality standards or are not expected to meet applicable water quality standards even after the application of the technology-based effluent limitations required by Sections 301(b) and 306 of the CWA, and to establish TMDLs for those waters. TMDLs are being developed to deal with specific water quality impairments in specific water bodies. In order to assure that its TMDLs are technically and legally defensible, MDE will continue to seek information from federal, state, local and private sources in preparing TMDLs. As TMDLs are developed, they will be circulated for public review and comment before submittal to EPA for approval. Every effort will be made to coordinate the TMDLs, Tributary Strategies, and other relevant plans and objectives to make them as consistent as possible. All parties must recognize that there is a legal obligation for Maryland to develop TMDLs to meet water quality standards in impaired waters as prescribed by the Clean Water Act. This is likely to continue to 4  There are several voluntary programs in the state. One example of such program is TEAM DNR. TEAM DNR is a voluntary program with the mission of educating elementary school children about the Chesapeake Bay and other Maryland natural resource issues. Highly trained volunteers deliver hands on presentations to elementary school students around the State. Their efforts provide an important link between DNR and schools. Since the program began in 1997, TEAM DNR volunteers have reached more than 3,500 fifth grade students. TEAM DNR offers two separate classroom programs: Chesapeake Bay Watershed and Horseshoe Crabs. The presentations consist of three activities and last about 50 minutes. This service offers teachers the opportunity to enhance their Chesapeake Bay education efforts.  MDE  12 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  challenge Maryland's flexibility in meeting multiple water quality management objectives. 2.3.7 Nutrient Control Efforts  As noted above, nutrient control is a major focus of water pollution control efforts in Maryland. The linkage between the CWAP and TMDL efforts is based on the use of the Section 303(d) list of impaired waters, for which TMDLs must be developed. Specifically, the 303(d) list was used as a primary selection criterion for Maryland's CWAP Priority 1 category (watersheds in need of restoration). The TMDLs developed for these impaired waters will also be a major component of Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRAS), which must be developed in order for Maryland to be eligible for federal CWAP funds. The Chesapeake Bay Agreement nutrient goals and Maryland's Tributary Strategies are a major driving force for Maryland's nutrient control efforts. The State has been working on these efforts for many years and most interested Maryland citizens are familiar with these efforts. The Tributary Teams, described in Section 2.3.5 above, will continue to play a key role in the planning and implementation of Maryland's voluntary and regulatory nutrient reduction efforts, including CWAP and TMDLs. The Protocols for Nutrient and Sediment Reduction Areas (PN/SRAs) under development by the Bay Program, will provide additional information to guide planning and implementation efforts, including future Unified Watershed Assessments and 303(d) lists of impaired waters. 2.3.8 Coordination  The CWAP, Chesapeake Bay Agreement, and Clean Water Act implementation are all vital components of Maryland's environmental restoration and protection strategy. They will require the cooperative efforts of all Maryland citizens if we are to be successful. Clearly, these efforts are closely related, have similar goals and approaches, and can be implemented in a coordinated manner that will strengthen all of the related programs. Under the direction of Governor Glendening's Chesapeake Bay Cabinet, the Departments of Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture, the Office of Planning, and the University of Maryland work together to ensure that Maryland's environmental programs are well coordinated. Other advisory committees (State Water Quality Advisory Committee, Coastal and Watershed Resources Advisory Committee, and the Tributary Strategy Teams) play key roles in the coordination effort, bringing key stakeholders into the planning, decision-making and implementation process. Maryland Water Monitoring Council (MWMC) was established in 1996 to foster coordination, cooperation and collaboration regarding water monitoring activities. More discussion on MWMC is presented in Section 3.3.3 of this document.  MDE  13 of 46  06/23/00    Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  CHAPTER 3.0 ELEMENTS OF THE CONTINUING PLANNING PROCESS Chapter 3.0 of this document addresses all the required elements of the CPP (as outlined in 40 CFR 130.5, Subsections 1 through 9) individually. Each Subsection of Chapter 3.0 of this document corresponds to the individual requirement of 40 CFR 130.5 (b). 3.1 DEVELOPMENT OF EFFLUENT LIMITS AND SCHEDULE OF COMPLIANCE 40 CFR 130.5 (b)(1): The process for developing effluent limitations and schedules of compliance at least as stringent as those required by Sections 301(b))(1) and (2), 306 and 307, and at least as stringent as any requirements contained in applicable water quality standards in effect under authority of Section 303 of the Act. ""Development of effluent limits"" and ""schedule of compliance"" are discussed individually in the subsequent paragraphs. 3.1.1 Development of Effluent Limits  The surface water discharge permit combines the requirements of the State discharge permit program and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) into one permit for wastewater treatment facilities that discharge to State surface waters. The overall objective of the State's Discharge Permit program for wastewater discharges (both municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater) is to ensure that the State's water quality standards are not violated as a result of a single discharge or group of discharges to specific water bodies. Within the Department of the Environment, responsibility for issuing discharge permits resides in the Water Management Administration. This Section describes the policies and procedures followed during the preparation of sewage discharge permits. Municipal Wastewater Discharges In order to set permit limitations for discharge of treated municipal wastewater, into water body, the State first determines the ability of a receiving body of water to assimilate certain pollutants without undergoing a water quality standards violation. The State then determines an appropriate waste load allocation (WLA) for each sewage discharge to the water body requiring a permit. Water quality-based parameters (such as biochemical oxygen demand, commonly known as BOD) are used while determining WLA. The WLA reflects the loading limitations that are necessary to ensure that the total assimilative capacity of the waterbody will not be exceeded.  MDE  15 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  The State applies a WLA process to each sewage discharge requiring an NPDES permit. The Division of Permits is responsible for conducting the WLA process. Division staff applies a variety of techniques to carry out this process. Mathematical models take into account, ambient water quality conditions, existing upstream and downstream discharges, and nonpoint source contributions where appropriate. The results of bioassays, statistical testing and benefit-cost analysis may also be considered. Discharge permit limitations must allow water quality standards to be achieved or maintained under ""worst"" case conditions. These conditions are defined as those occurring during a consecutive seven-day period of low water flow which occur statistically only once every ten years. Based on the outcome of the WLA analysis, a determination is made as to whether treatment beyond secondary treatment (see foot note  ) removal of pollutants is necessary to achieve or maintain water quality standards. If this is not necessary, then the discharge permit limitations are those associated with the application of secondary treatment technology. In cases where standards cannot be met with secondary treatment, limitations that are more restrictive must be determined. These more restrictive limitations are based on WLA that are generally applied to pollutants which readily decay and have the potential to affect DO concentrations, including total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and BOD. The extent of eutrophication in the receiving body is also considered and, when it is determined to be appropriate, a WLA for phosphorus is developed. Waterways in which ambient water quality conditions necessitate the application of discharge limitations more restrictive than those associated with secondary treatment are said to be ""water quality limited"" with respect to additional wasteloads they may receive. Waters capable of assimilating secondary effluent are called ""effluent limited"" because the characteristics of the effluent, rather than existing water quality, dictate acceptable limitations. These terms reflect the evolution of the field of water pollution control from one that originally emphasized technological practicality to one that involves more sophisticated assessment of water quality impacts. In Maryland, it is important to note that all NPDES permit limitations for sewage discharges are subject to a water quality impact analysis. The determination of WLA for freely flowing streams is technically well established. However, the physical and chemical behavior of estuarine waters is considerably more complex and not nearly as well understood. Therefore, determining WLAs for discharges to estuarine waters is still very much evolving. The WLA procedure for discharges to any waters of the State is always subject to refinement as more knowledge of water quality impacts is gained. (The Division of Permits maintains a ""Procedures Manual for the Determination of Effluent Limits"" as a technical reference document). Nitrogen, as a nutrient, is specifically considered in the nutrient reduction strategies developed for the Maryland tributaries, and reduction goals are included in the permits of major facilities that have received state funding to implement biological nutrient removal (BNR).  Secondary treatment is the federally mandated minimum level of treatment for sewage discharges  MDE  16 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  In addition to these standard constituents, if a publicly owned treatment work (POTW) receives industrial waste that contains certain toxic compounds, permit limitations for these toxic compounds may be required. With respect to toxics, the State has a biomonitoring (Whole Effluent Toxicity or WET testing) project designed to determine the degree of toxicity of selected sewage effluents that contain industrial waste components. (See also the explanation of Maryland's Industrial Pretreatment Program). Industrial Wastewater Discharges Within the Department of the Environment, the responsibility of issuing industrial discharge permits resides in the Water Management Administration (WMA). This Section describes the policies and methodologies followed during preparation of industrial discharge permits. The process for developing discharge permits for industrial wastewater depends on the quality of the receiving waters. Where the receiving water body meets or exceeds water quality standards, permit limitations based on the limits of technology are developed. There are two general approaches for developing technology-based limits for industrial permits: national effluent guidelines (EGLs) and best professional judgement (BPJ)5. National EGLs are developed by EPA based on the demonstrated performance of a reasonable level of treatment that is within the economic means of specific categories of industrial facilities. Where national EGLs have not been developed, the same performance-based approach is applied to a specific industrial facility based on the permit writer's BPJ. In either case, the intent of a technology-based limit is to require a minimum level of treatment for industrial point sources based on an appropriate treatment technology while allowing the discharger to use any available control technique to meet the limitations. This paragraph explains the BPJ process (in the event EPA has not established an EGL). If the permit being prepared is a renewal of an existing permit, then discharge monitoring report data are available to characterize the effluent. In instances where the receiving water is effluent-limited as opposed to water quality - limited, statistical analysis may be performed to establish a long-term average of the effluent concentration and a measure of the variability. From this information, the 95th percentile of the effluent concentration of specified concentration may be used as the average permit limitation. Twice this value is used as the daily maximum permit limitation. Another approach employed is to examine EGL information which is either not promulgated or remanded, or evaluate EGLs from a similar industry. If the data indicate that the waste streams are similar, and that the appropriate technology is applicable to the industry under consideration, then the proposed EGL may be used to develop effluent limits. An example of the former situation is the use of proposed EGLs in the development document for poultry processing as the basis for establishing limits for a chicken processing plant. An example of the latter category is the use of coal mining EGLs (40 CFR Part 434) 5  The EGLs are employed whenever applicable. However, many of the discharges, which are permitted, do not fit into any of the categories for which EGLs are available. In these instances, a variety of other approaches are applied to develop effluent limits for inclusion in the permit. Collectively, this approach is known as best professional judgement (BPJ).  MDE  17 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  to establish limits on total suspended solids and iron at sediment pond discharges resulting from fly ash storage sites. In other words, if EPA has established an EGL, that would apply. If imposition of a technology or performance-based limit discussed above will cause impairment of water quality, then a more stringent water quality-based limit is applied using applicable water quality standards. Limits are chosen so that the discharge will not impair water quality or so that in-stream concentrations outside of the mixing zone do not exceed applicable EPA water quality criteria or State water quality standards. This is determined by evaluating steam flow, effluent flow, upstream or background levels for the pollutant of concern, and levels of the pollutant in the discharge. Where an industrial discharger discharges to a receiving water body that is not meeting water quality standards, the state develops effluent limitations designed to achieve them. Like the effluent limitations for municipal discharges previously described, these water quality-based limitations are derived from the total assimilative capacity of the water body for the pollutant at issue. Several different levels of treatment are specified in the Clean Water Act. Best available technology (BAT) is required for all non-conventional pollutants and best conventional technology (BCT) is required for conventional pollutants. For new sources, new source performance standards (NSPS) provide limits. If the wastewater is discharged to a publicly owned treatment work, then either pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS) or existing sources (PSES) provide the appropriate requirements. In some industrial categories, BCT is not available. In these cases, best practicable technology (BPT) is used to establish limits for conventional pollutants. Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) testing may be used in conjunction with any of the techniques discussed above in developing permit requirements. This involves the use of an EPA test procedure for indicating toxicity of a whole effluent, which is a mixture of various components with potential synergistic and/or antagonistic effects on an aquatic environment. All major industries are required to perform WET tests as a permit condition and to submit the results to the Department. Where toxicity has been found, the permittees have been required to follow EPA guidance to conduct Toxicity Reduction Evaluations to determine and eliminate the cause of the toxicity. In addition, through contractual arrangement, the Department has operated its own WET testing laboratory to independently test industrial effluents since 1987. 3.1.2 Schedule of Compliance  Compliance schedules are required in circumstances where a discharge is not currently achieving permitted effluent limits. The compliance schedule establishes enforceable milestones throughout the process to achieve the limitations set forth in the permit within the period of the permit. Because design, procurement, and installation of an improved treatment system requires time, interim period must be allowed during which the treatment system is put into place. The compliance schedule establishes enforceable milestones throughout the process to achieve final limitations. Interim effluent MDE  18 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  limitations, which are less restrictive than the final limitations, may be established based on the State's determination on the highest capability of an existing treatment system. The NPDES permit for a given facility in this case would include: 1) the final effluent limitations, 2) the interim effluent limitations, and 3) the compliance schedule for achieving the final limitations. NPDES permits are typically issued for a maximum five-year period. In addition to the development of permit limitations and schedules of compliance for both public and private sewage facilities, the State performs several other tasks related to both short and long-range pollution control activities. The Water Management Administration is responsible for providing effluent limitations for twenty-year planning efforts associated with the sewage construction grants program. This same unit also conducts advanced waste treatment reviews in accordance with the State's facility planning delegation agreement. For industrial discharges, where EGLs are used to establish permit limits at the BAT level, compliance schedules cannot be made part of the discharge permit. The Clean Water Act specifies that BAT must be applied no later than July 1, 1984. For a permit issued after that date, BAT must be required immediately. If a compliance period is necessary, the compliance schedule must be contained in a consent agreement that is issued concurrently with the discharge permit.  3.2  INCORPORATING SECTIONS 208 AND 209 of CWA 40 CFR 130.5 (b)(2): The process for incorporating elements of any applicable areawide waste treatment plans under Section 208, and applicable basin plans under Section 209 of the Act.  Over the past year, hundreds of concerned citizens, businessmen and government staff have worked together to select a menu of ""nutrient reduction options"" for use in the Tributary Strategies. These include regulatory and voluntary programs, new directions for state and local governments and non-governmental activities. There are 17 major wastewater treatment plants in Maryland removing nitrogen. Eight of these plants are in the Patuxent watershed where much of the effort toward point source reduction has been directed. The Strategies call for an additional 47 major treatment plants to be upgraded for nitrogen and phosphorus removal; 33 of these plants have entered into agreements with MDE to begin nitrogen removal (More information can be found in Restoring the Chesapeake  Chesapeake Bay Progress Report, 1995). With regard to basin plans (Section 209 of CWA), Maryland has initiated several studies. An example is the studies conducted by the Tributary Teams on ten watersheds (also see Section 2.3 of this report). Tributary teams formed in each of ten watersheds are made up of representatives of state and local agencies, farmers, businesses, environmental organizations, federal facilities, and citizens. More information on the studies can be found at DNR website. MDE  19 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  In summary, all applicable elements of Sections 208 and 209 of CWA (with regard to waste treatment plants and basin plans respectively) have been incorporated in Maryland's existing water quality plans.  3.3  DEVELOPING TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOADS (TMDLs) AND WATER QUALITY BASED EFFLUENT LIMITS 40 CFR 130.5 (b)(3): The process for developing total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) and individual water quality based effluent limitations for pollutants in accordance with Section 303(d) of the Act and  130.7(a) of this regulation.  3.3.1 Purpose The purpose of this Section is to describe the procedures associated with Maryland's Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program, and how the approved loads are incorporated into the State's Water Quality Management Plans (WQMPs) and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Wastewater and Industrial Discharge permits. This Section is organized in the following manner. Section 3.3.2 provides the reader with some contextual background. Section 3.3.3 provides an overview of the State's water quality monitoring program. Section 3.3.4 provides an overview of the State=s process for preparing the biannual water quality inventory report required under Section 305(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). Section 3.3.5 describes the State's process for revising the List of Impaired Waters (Section 303(d) of CWA). It also describes how priorities and TMDL development schedules are determined for waters identified in the 303(d) List, and describes the process of public involvement, and submittal for EPA approval. Section 3.3.6 provides an overview of the process by which TMDLs are established in Maryland, including the load allocation process, and the process of public involvement, and submittal for EPA approval. Section 3.3.7 provides an overview of the State's process for incorporating TMDLs into State's WQMPs, in which Maryland will maintain lists of EPA-approved TMDLs. Section 3.3.8 provides an overview of the State's process for incorporating approved loads into NPDES Wastewater and Industrial Discharge permits. In accordance with 40 CFR 130.7, Maryland recognizes that public participation is an important element in the TMDL process. Public participation is discussed separately in Chapter 4.0 of this document. 3.3.2 Background The federal CWA requires all states to monitor and maintain an inventory of the quality of their waters. For waters that remain impaired, even after all required technologies have been implemented, states are required to calculate a TMDL, which among other things, requires the state to determine the water's maximal capacity to withstand an impairing substance or stressor, and still meet the water quality standards and to allocate that load among sources. In cases for which the establishment of a TMDL is necessary, additional steps are taken to MDE  20 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  attain the goals of the TMDL, and thereby achieve and maintain water quality standards. These additional controls can be categorized into two general classes: (1) controls for point sources of pollution (typically defined as pollution that comes from the end of a pipe); and (2) controls for the remaining nonpoint sources of pollution (typically defined as diffuse sources of pollution). A Margin of Safety also is required. The general framework by which both point sources and nonpoint sources are addressed after the establishment of a TMDL is expanded upon in Section 3.3.7 of this document. The remainder of this Section describes the key procedures associated with Maryland's TMDL program, and how the approved loads are incorporated into the State's WQMPs and NPDES Wastewater and Industrial permits. 3.3.3 State Water Quality Monitoring Programs for Assessing the Waters of the State and for Establishing TMDLs  The State's water quality monitoring strategy is designed to integrate information from many sources of water quality data, including local governments, academic institutions and others (See: Maryland's Water Quality Monitoring Strategy, prepared by the DNR). Strictly speaking, the ""State water quality monitoring programs"" represent a subset of this holistic monitoring strategy. The responsibility for the overall coordination and documentation of Maryland's Water Quality Monitoring Strategy lies with the DNR. Due to the many regulatory requirements for water quality monitoring, for which the MDE is responsible, MDE and DNR have shared responsibilities in planning, documenting, and executing the monitoring strategy. Coordination with non-State entities is conducted through the Maryland Water Monitoring Council (MWMC)6. The monitoring strategy is reevaluated every five years to ensure updated and accurate information. It should be understood that, although the Maryland DNR serves a coordinating role for water quality monitoring, water quality monitoring by the State of Maryland is achieved via many monitoring activities, which are of necessity spread among many different functional programs in State government. A joint responsibility of DNR and MDE is to assure that the State's water quality monitoring strategy achieves minimum statutory and regulatory requirements. Because of these requirements, the State water quality monitoring programs must assure that sufficient water quality data is generated to enable the comprehensive assessment of the waters of the State. State water quality monitoring programs also must generate sufficient water quality data to enable the development of technically defensible TMDLs. The remainder of this subsection briefly describes the process by which water quality monitoring in Maryland supports the development of the State water quality inventory report (Section 305(b) Report), and the State list of impaired waters (Section 303(d) List). In addition, the monitoring framework used to generate sufficient water quality data to support the development of TMDLs is described. Descriptions of other water quality monitoring programs of the State are described or 6  MWMC was established to help achieve effective collection, interpretation, and dissemination of aquatic resource monitoring data used in addressing issues, policies, and management of the State's waters. Sponsorship was formally approved by the DNR in 1996.  MDE  21 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  referenced in the Maryland Water Quality Monitoring Strategy (Maryland DNR). Additionally, the report Maryland Water Quality Inventory, revised every two years by the DNR (pursuant to Section 305(b) of the CWA), also discusses water quality monitoring programs in the State. This inventory is commonly known as 305(b) Report7. The State employs a variety of monitoring programs designed to assess the status of ambient water quality conditions, determine the presence of trends, seek associations between water quality and various anthropogenic stressors, and evaluate specific water quality problems. State's monitoring programs are classified into the following categories:    long-term ambient monitoring intensive monitoring estuarine monitoring  The process of determining impairments for the 303(d) List begins with Maryland's 305(b) Report. Not all of the impairments identified in the 305(b) Report constitute a water quality limited segment requiring the development of a TMDL under Section 303(d) of the CWA. Methodologies for determining impaired waters for the 303(d) list are described in Water Quality Limited Segments (WQLS)  the package (commonly known as ""303(d) List Submittal Package"") submitted to EPA by MDE in 1998. As mentioned earlier Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) are required, by 303(d), of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA). Pursuant to this Section and implementing federal regulations (40 CFR 130), Maryland prepared a list of impaired waters (commonly known as the 303(d) list). The list is made available for public review and is subject to the approval by the EPA. A subset of the State's data collection effort, designed to support TMDL development, is being conducted by the MDE within Maryland's Watershed Cycling Strategy framework. According to this framework, the State is divided into five regions so that intensified water quality management resources can be targeted to the regions in a systematic manner. Briefly, for a given region, the cycle begins with the water quality monitoring and other collection of data in the initial year, followed by TMDL development, which is used to support watershed-based permitting in subsequent years. Various activities under Maryland's Watershed Cycling Strategy are briefly discussed in the next few paragraphs. Maryland's Watershed Cycling Strategy As explained above, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is implementing a watershed-based permitting system. To facilitate this, MDE had developed a watershed cycling framework in which the State is divided into five regions (Figure 2). Water quality management 7  Also see Section 3.3.4 of this document for further discussion on 305(b) process.  MDE  22 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  activities will be cycled through those regions over a five-year period. This approach allows a significant amount of resources to be concentrated in 20% of the State at any given time, thereby increasing both the efficient use of resources and the intensity of water quality evaluations. Based on this study, permits are reissued every five years. Historically, permits in the same watershed have been issued in different years, because the initial permit issuance dates differed. Maryland is currently in a transition period, after which permitting activities in the same watershed will be conducted simultaneously. Under the watershed cycling strategy, each five-year cycle begins with intensive monitoring, followed by the development of TMDLs where necessary, followed by the watershed-based permitting and other implementation activities (Figure 3). Because the watershed cycle is repeated, this approach ensures that the effectiveness of the implementation activities will be evaluated by field monitoring. In a given year, the watershed cycling strategy concentrates approximately 80% of MDE's available resources for field work in approximately one-fifth of the State (i.e., one of the five watershed regions). This field work entails water quality monitoring, pollutant source assessment, and collection of other physical parameters to support TMDL modeling and the establishment of NPDES permits. The remaining 20% of MDE's monitoring resources are reserved for high-priority TMDL work and immediate NPDES permitting needs that fall outside of the watershed region. According to the strategy, complete coverage of the State for these important water quality management activities will occur in five-year cycle. This approach is supported by the EPA. After monitoring is completed in the watershed, data assessment and TMDL development will occur. At that time, the monitoring resources will be shifted into the next watershed. The assessment will entail data validation to assure quality of the information, data processing and interpretation to characterize the problem, and data processing to create computer model input files. During TMDL development an appropriate model will be developed and applied to quantify the feasible controls expressed in terms of the maximum pollutant load or stress, and the establishment of allocations between point and nonpoint sources. The TMDL development step in the cycling strategy also involves TMDL documentation and TMDL adoption through a formal public process. After the establishment of TMDL, additional planning of implementation steps is necessary. According to the cycling strategy, these detailed implementation planning activities are envisioned to begin following the establishment of the TMDL. The implementation process will depend on the type of TMDL. In general, implementation will involve identification of specific pollution reduction controls that are needed to meet TMDL goal, and the establish administrative procedures for state and local environmental management programs, which will ensure the TMDL limit is maintained. It is within this cycle of the watershed cycling strategy that additional public outreach will be conducted. 3.3.4 State Water Quality Inventory: Section 305(b) Report In accordance with Section 305 (b)(1) of the CWA, the State is required to prepare water MDE  23 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  quality report biennially to provide information to the EPA and the Congress about water quality conditions in the State and the status of State efforts to meet the goals of the federal law. The most recent report ""1998 Maryland Section 305 (b) Water Quality Report ,"" prepared in December 1998, provides summary information on surface and ground water quality conditions in Maryland and identifies water quality impairments and the known or probable cause and sources of these impairments Statewide. The State's surface and ground water pollution control programs, monitoring strategy and programs, and special State concerns are also described in this document. 3.3.5 State List of Impaired Waters: Section 303(d) List  Section 303 (d) of the CWA and its amendments require States to identify and prioritize waters for which technology-based effluent limits required by Sections 301(b) and 306 of the CWA are not stringent enough to meet water quality standards. For each of these ""water quality-limited segments,"" the State must determine the maximum level of any impairing pollutant that can be borne in the water without causing violations of established water quality standards. By calculating this maximum pollutant load, then allocating the load among various sources (both point and nonpoint), water quality standards should be met. Following is the process involved as described in 303(d) list8:       Watersheds in question are organized by their names and respective logical code numbers Watersheds are classified into categories such as, tidal or impoundment Watersheds are exactly identified with respect to their latitude and longitude This list also indicates the suspected substance(s) that would make the watershed impaired (for example, nutrients, heavy metals, or coliform bacteria) This list identifies the possible source of this substance in water (point or nonpoint source) In terms of finding the solutions to the current problems, these watersheds have been prioritized, such as High, Medium or Low  MDE is the lead agency for the State's TMDL Program and most regulatory water quality programs. MDE updates Maryland's list of water quality-limited segments [303 (d) list] from time to time as required by the applicable EPA regulations, using data from the 305 (b) report with other existing and readily available information. The protocols and decision criteria associated with the development of the 303 (d) list are currently under review by an interagency workgroup made of staff from MDE, DNR, the Department of Agriculture, Department of Transportation, the Office of Planning, and University of Maryland. More information on 303(d) list can be found at MDE website. Across the State, there are approximately 130 rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs and estuaries that are impaired by one of the following pollutants: toxics, acidity, toxic chemicals or fecal coliform bacteria. Maryland's most recent TMDL list was approved by the EPA in September 1998. 3.3.6 State Process for Establishing TMDLs  8  This list also indicates whether a particular watershed is targeted for the next two years.  MDE  24 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  The first step in the TMDL process is to identify waterbodies that are impaired and should have TMDLs. This involves assessing existing water quality information collected by a variety of monitoring techniques. Where necessary, additional monitoring may be conducted to fill in data gaps necessary to support a defensible TMDL. Computer modeling is then used to estimate pollutant loadings to the waterbodies, and water quality impacts of the pollutant loadings under varying conditions, such as low stream flows. The modeling is used to estimate the maximum load of pollutants that will not violate water standards. Once this maximum pollutant load is defined, it must be allocated between point and nonpoint sources, accounting for the margin of safety and future allocation as follows: TMDL = Point Source Allocation + Nonpoint Source Allocation + Margin of Safety + Future Allocation  The allocation will balance equity and cost considerations, and may involve innovative approaches such as trading between different pollutant sources. The public, affected dischargers, regional agencies, and local governments9 will be involved in the TMDL process. Public participation is further discussed in Section 4.0 of this document. 3.3.7 Incorporation of TMDLs into State Water Quality Management Plans After the establishment of a TMDL, additional steps are taken to attain the goals of the TMDL, and thereby achieve and maintain water quality standards. These additional controls can be categorized into two general classes: Controls for point sources of pollution (typically defined as pollution that comes from the end of a pipe), and controls for the remaining nonpoint sources of pollution (typically defined as diffuse sources of pollution). Upon approval of a TMDL by EPA, the measures for conducting future environmental management activities will be documented through Maryland's Continuing Planning Process (CPP). NPDES Permit limits for point sources must be consistent with the waste load allocations established as part of the TMDLs. Non-point source controls may be established by implementing Best Management Practices (BMPs) through voluntary or mandatory programs for enforcement, technical assistance, financial assistance, education, training, technology transfer, and demonstration projects. Water Quality Management Plans also provide more information on TMDL implementation. Updating Water Quality Management Plans are further discussed in Section 3.4 of this document. 3.3.8 Incorporation of Approved Loads into NPDES Wastewater and Industrial Discharge Permits  For point sources, incorporation of approved TMDLs into NPDES Wastewater and Industrial Discharge Permits is briefly discussed in the previous Section. More information on TMDLs and related issues can be found at MDE website. 9  Procedure of involvement of the Local government is recently established.  MDE  25 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  For nonpoint sources, controls are established by implementing Best Management Practices (BMPs) through voluntary or mandatory programs for enforcement, technical assistance, financial assistance, education, training, technology transfer, and demonstration project. Additionally, when allowing for nonpoint source controls, implementation plans will provide the following:   A reasonable assurance that the controls will be implemented and maintained, or An effective monitoring program to demonstrate that nonpoint source reductions are taking place. State's water quality monitoring program is already discussed in Section 3.3.3 of this document.  3.4  UPDATING AND MAINTAINING WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLANS 40 CFR 130.5 (b)(4): The process for updating and maintaining Water Quality Management (WQM) plans, including schedules for revision.  Over the past several years, the State of Maryland has developed several reports (and plans) related to water quality management. Some of these reports are being periodically updated. Table 1 gives the examples of typical Water Quality Management Plans (WQMP) that describe various water quality management activities in Maryland. These plans are updated approximately every two years; however depending on the situation, some of these reports might be updated in less than two-year intervals. These WQMPs discuss on the current situation of water quality and strategies to be implemented to achieve water quality goals. Input from Maryland Tributary Teams10, and general public are considered for updating and maintaining WQM. These updates will be documented through the Maryland's Continuing Planning Process (CPP). Public participation is further discussed in Chapter 4.0 of this document.  3.5  INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION 40 CFR 130.5 (b)(5): The process for assuring adequate authority for intergovernmental cooperation in the implementation of the State WQM program  As a result of the reorganization of State environmental programs in 1995, the Maryland Department of the Environment remains the primary implementation and enforcement agency for water management programs. However, activities conducted by other State agencies, as well as by regional organizations and local government, play roles in water pollution control throughout Maryland. Appendix A provides a comprehensive inventory of existing activities carried out by the various 10  Maryland's Tributary Teams, comprised of local citizens, farmers, business leaders and government officials appointed by the Governor are working to keep Maryland's waterways clean and healthy.

Environmental Partnership Agreement of 1999: Environmental Partnership Agreement (EnPA) of 1999 is a typical example of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues. This Environmental Performance Partnership Agreement is entered into between the Regional Administrator of Region III of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Secretaries of the Maryland Departments of Environment (MDE) and Natural Resources (DNR). The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) is a cooperating agency, but is not a signatory to this Agreement. In the last few years, states and the federal government have been entering into agreements that seek to better coordinate efforts to protect human health and the environment. This list also indicates whether a particular watershed is targeted for the next two years. In 1998, Maryland's public health, environmental and natural resources protection agencies entered into their first agreement with the EPA. The purpose of the FY 1998 Agreement between the MDE and DNR (the Departments) and the EPA, was to provide for the development of a long-term, results-based management plan that will improve the effectiveness of Maryland's environmental programs and strengthen the relationship between the Departments and EPA. That Agreement established a multi-year strategic planning/agreement process that set forth Maryland's environmental goals, identified the programs designed to achieve those goals, established and adopted indicators to measure progress, described existing workload responsibilities, 11  All counties and city of Baltimore are required to have water and sewer plans. As a part of Continuing Planning Process, these jurisdictions amend and update their plans on a routine basis. Every three years a report of the review of their existing plans is required (required by the State law). Water and sewer plans are maintained by the Water Management Administration (WMA) of the MDE. WMA is charged with administering the program as current as possible. Solid waste issue is discussed under Section 3.7 of this document.  MDE  27 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  defined the State/EPA relationship, and reflected a comprehensive public participation process that will help guide future program direction. Involving the public throughout the Environmental Performance Partnership process has been a guiding principle for the Partners. Last year, formal public meetings were held at locations across the state. In addition, a wide variety of stakeholder groups were consulted regularly, and many of the key documents associated with the formation of this Agreement were posted on the Internet. The public has played a vital role in shaping each of the elements of the Agreement. The Partners affirm the importance of this public participation process and recognize the value that public comments have added to the Agreement. In FY 1999, the Partners will continue to rely on their stakeholders and the public to provide ongoing input and feedback. Public participation issue is further discussed in Chapter 4.0 of this document. River Basin Commissions : This is another example of Maryland's interaction with other agencies. Regarding the development of Maryland's Smart Growth Plan, there are two river basin commissions of greatest interest: the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB) and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC). These Commissions provide two Smart Growth opportunities: (1) they provide a venue through which Maryland can educate neighboring states about growth issues in general, and Smart Growth in particular, and (2) the Commissions can help Maryland deal with interstate or regional issues related to Smart growth, such as water appropriations and nutrient loads to shared river segments. If Maryland can successfully accomplish the first, progress toward the second should follow. As Smart Growth proceeds, part of Maryland's intent is to lead the way by showing that growth issues can be dealt with successfully, and the political issues overcome. Recently, the Washington metropolitan area water suppliers, the Corps of Engineers, and the ICPRB worked closely together to manage regional water resources in times of drought. The work involved the implementation of operating procedures which have been developed and refined for two decades. More information on this can be found in MDE and DNR websites.  3.6  ESTABLISHING AND IMPLEMENTING WATER QUALITY STANDARDS 40 CFR 130.5 (b)(6): The process for establishing and assuring adequate implementation of new or revised water quality standards, including schedule of compliance, under Section 303(c) of the Act  Maryland's water quality management program is a comprehensive, long range program aimed at assessment of existing and potential sources of pollution. Integral to this process is the development and implementation of water quality standards that define and protect existing water quality and its designated uses. Another important element is the development and implementation of regulations that specifically address and control various types of water pollution. Water pollution control regulations are viewed as a dynamic process capable of change in response to increased understanding of water pollution problems. MDE  28 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  Currently, the State's water quality standards are codified in COMAR 26.08.01 (Water Pollution - General) and COMAR 26.08.02 (Water Quality). The standards establish designated uses of surface water and establish water quality criteria to protect these designated uses. In addition, these regulations define the anti-degradation policy of the State as well as other policies that apply to water quality standards. All waters of the State are currently protected for the basic uses of water contact recreation, fish and other aquatic life, wildlife and water supply. The state reviews its water quality standards every three years as required by the CWA. Development of water pollution control regulations is of equal importance to the development of water quality standards. Water pollution control regulations seek to assure that pollution sources are controlled so that State water quality standards are not violated. These regulations are specific in nature and address problems identified as having an adverse impact on water quality. Water pollution control regulations are contained in COMAR 26.08.03 (Discharge Limitations), 26.08.04 (Permits) and 26.08.08 (Pretreatment). Public participation is an important component in establishing and implementing water quality standards. Public participation is further discussed in Chapter 4.0 of this document.  3.7  MANAGEMENT OF RESIDUALS FROM WATER TREATMENT PROCESSING 40 CFR 130.5 (b)(7): The process for assuring adequate controls over the disposition of all residual waste from any water treatment processing  Residuals from drinking water treatment plants include the wastes from two major unit processes: sludge from the sedimentation process and spent backwash water from the filtration process. These wastes are handled in several different ways by the water systems in Maryland, depending on the design and capabilities of the treatment plant, and on the community that the treatment plant serves. Options include:   Wastes sent to a wastewater plant through the collection system or by truck hauling Wastes treated in a separate settling process which will allow solids to settle out:. Solids are sometimes sent to on-site drying beds. Solids are removed and disposed of through land application or other permitted method. The decant is sent to a wastewater plant or recycled. Wastes recycled to the head of the treatment process: Although the least desirable of all waste management options, if this is done, it is recommended that no more than 5% of the total raw water flow be recycled over an extended time. Wastes sent to the raw water source, usually downstream of the raw water intake: This is a permitted discharge. 29 of 46 06/23/00      MDE   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  3.8.  CONSTRUCTION NEEDS FOR WAS TEWATER TREATMENT 40 CFR 130.5 (b)(8): The process for developing an inventory and ranking, in order of priority of needs for construction of waste treatment works required to meet the applicable requirements of Sections 301 and 302 of the Act.  3.8.1  Ne eds Survey  The Needs Survey, a joint effort of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the States, is an assessment of needed publicly-owned wastewater treatment facilities, correction of combined sewer overflows, and management of stormwater and nonpoint source pollution, in the United States. The State provides data for the survey to EPA for biennial report to Congress as required by Sections 205(a) and 516(b) (1) of the Clean Water Act. For budgetary reasons, the Survey is now conducted every four years (although the stature stipulates biennial). The Needs Survey assesses the capital investment required to meet wastewater infrastructure needs of current population, as well as the additional amount needed for population growth for the next 20 years and to meet water quality standards. The Needs Survey includes water quality programs and projects eligible for funding under the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund (SRF) program in accordance with Title VI of the CWA. It encompasses the documented capital costs required to meet the needs of wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure in accordance with Section 212 of the CWA including not only publicly owned treatment works (POTWs), but also combined sewer overflows (CSOs), separate sewer overflows (SSOs) and phase I/II stormwater project. It also covers the Nonpoint Source (NPS) and National Estuary Programs defined in Section 319 and 320 of the CWA, respectively. A ""need"" is a cost estimate for a project eligible for SRF funding under the CWA. The cost estimates for the needs identified in the Needs Survey are either reported by the States or modeled by the EPA. Reported needs include costs for facilities used in the conveyance, storage, treatment, recycling, and reclamation of municipal sewage wastes. Estimates are included for all types of needed changes to wastewater facilities, including constructing entirely new facilities as well as enlarging, upgrading, abandoning, and replacing existing facilities. Existing facilities are considered for replacement when they have reached the end of their design life and are obsolete. Additionally, costs for structural and non-structural measures and costs to develop and implement State and municipal stormwater and NPS programs are included. For the modeled categories (i.e. stormwater and NPS), EPA prepared cost estimates for facilities and program activities eligible for funding under the SRF program. These estimates do not include costs for operation and maintenance. It should also be noted that in accordance with the ""Funding Framework"" document, non-structural (nonpoint source) measures are not eligible for SRF funding. SRF funds will be used to implement the activities mentioned in the approved NPS Management Plans (prepared in accordance with Section 319 of the CWA) and MDE  30 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  they will not be used to develop NPS activities. Needs estimates are presented in Table 2 for the various categories of wastewater treatment and water pollution control projects. Categories I through V are prominent in the Construction Grant Program. Accordingly, these are often referred to, as ""traditional"" needs categories. Cost Data. Working through the state agencies, EPA obtains estimates of the needed future capital investment for each individual municipal wastewater treatment facility. The cost estimates are for those portions of a facility eligible for federal financial assistance under the Clean Water Act. Cost estimates are obtained from detailed planning documents whenever possible. Costs for small systems are modeled based on a review of selected small systems. Facility Data. In addition to cost data, various types of technical information for each facility are collected. Of interest are the operational status of the facility, the population of the service area, the existing or planned treatment process, anticipated changes or additions to the treatment process, current and projected effluent quality, and required sewer system expansions or improvements. As part of the FY 2000 survey, emphasis is being placed on inputting latitude and longitude information for all facilities. Hydrologic Data. The cost and facility data are also linked to various hydrologic data for national analysis and basin-wide water quality simulation. Stream system data include hydrologic flow paths, mean and low flows, and stream segment length, slope, and latitude/longitude. Pollution data for point sources include the receiving stream, current and planned municipal effluent characteristics and flows, and standardized industrial effluent data. Also included are the state-designated uses and the ammonia and dissolved oxygen criteria that apply to each stream. The data are grouped by the 21 U.S. Geological Survey regional hydrologic units. 3.8.2 Integrated Project Priority System (1999)  Maryland's Integrated Project Priority System was developed by the MDE and approved by the EPA. It outlines criteria for prioritizing wastewater, nonpoint source and estuary management projects into a single list (Priority list) to provide low interest loan funding through the SRF as authorized in title VI of the CWA. The priority listing represents a ranking of sewerage facility needs as well as eligible nonpoint source projects as determined through a comparative analysis as to the degree of severity of water quality and public health problems. Factors determining the relative order of priority include severity of pollution problem, anticipated benefit to be derived, and the ability of the project to meet federal and State enforcement requirements. With respect to the assessment of water pollution severity, the State draws directly upon the Maryland Clean Water Action Plan and the biennial documentation of Maryland's water quality prepared pursuant to Section 305 (b) and 303 (d) of the federal CWA. The Integrated Project Priority System outlines criteria and procedures for prioritizing wastewater, non-point source and estuary management projects into a single list (Project Priority List) to provide low interest loan funding through the Maryland Water Quality State Revolving Loan Fund MDE  31 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  (WQSRF) as authorized in title VI of the Clean Water Act. WQSRF financial assistance can be used to fund construction of publicly owned wastewater treatment works, implementation of non-point source capital improvements consistent with Maryland's Non-Point Source Management Plan (under Section 319 of the Clean Water Act), and implementation of estuary capital improvements consistent with Maryland's Coastal Bays Action Plan (an estuary conservation and management plan under Section 320 of the Clean Water Act). All project to be financed through WQSRF must have water quality/public health benefits. The priority list contains project information required by the EPA and is subject to the public participation process which includes mass distribution to applicants and interested parties and a public hearing before being submitted to the EPA for final approval. 3.8.3 Maryland Water Quality Financing Administration (WQFA)  The Maryland Water Quality Financing Administration (WQFA) was created during the 1988 session of the Maryland General Assembly as a component unit of the State of Maryland. The Administration's purpose is to encourage capital investment for wastewater and drinking water projects pursuant to the Clean Water Act of 1987, and the Safe Drinking Water Act and Amendments of 1996. The Administration administers two loan funds:  Water Quality Revolving Loan Fund (WQRLF) created during the 1988 session of the Maryland General Assembly for the purpose of providing below market rate of interest loans for wastewater projects;  Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund (DWRLF) created during the 1993 session of Maryland General Assembly for the purpose of providing below market rate of interest loans for drinking water projects. Both loan funds receive federal funding from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Capitalization Grants for State Revolving Funds federal assistance program. The Administration is empowered to issue bonds subject to approval of the State Board of Public Works and Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment (Department). Bonds issued by the Administration do not constitute a debt or pledge of the full faith and credit of the State or any political subdivision thereof, other than the Administration. The bonds are paid solely from the revenue, money or property of the Administration pledged therefor under its Indenture of Trust dated March 1, 1990, as amended (Indenture) between the Administration and its trustee bank. 3.8.4 General Water Quality State Revolving Fund Eligibility  Point Source Project  Types of projects involving construction of publicly owned wastewater (sewerage) facilities that reduce and prevent water pollution problems qualifying for funding and thereby qualifying for inclusion on the priority list include:  MDE  32 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment           3.8.5  New, expanded, or rehabilitated wastewater treatment plants including Biological Nutrient Removal Infiltration/inflow correction Replacement/rehabilitation of sewers Collector, trunk and interceptor sewers, pumping stations Combined sewer overflow abatement Septage receiving and handling facilities Sludge handling and disposal facilities Water treatment plant filter backwash and sludge treatment Leachate pretreatment at municipal landfills  General Water Quality State Revolving Fund Eligibility  Nonpoint Source Project  SRF financial assistance can be used to fund construction of publicly owned wastewater treatment works, implementation of non-point source capital improvements consistent with Maryland's NPS Management Plan, and implementation of estuary capital improvements consistent with Maryland's Coastal Bays Action Plan (an estuary conservation and management plan under Section 320 of the CWA). The project to be financed must have water quality benefits. SRF financial assistance can be obtained directly through the Department or through MDE's Linked Deposit Program, which enables public and private entities to use SRF loans as a source of low interest financing to implement eligible NPS projects. Both public and private entities may use SRF loans for eligible NPS projects. The types of NPS projects that are eligible for Maryland's SRF financing include:     Waterbody restoration that includes water quality improvements (example, stream bank stabilization, drainage erosion, and sediment control) Restoration of riparian vegetation, wetlands, and other waterbodies Aquatic habitat restoration and protection projects Existing stormwater management facility repair and new stormwater requirements. Examples of these include stormwater wet ponds, stormwater wetlands, infiltration practices, filter systems, open channel practices, and non-structural practices. Correction of failing septic systems Rehabilitation or removal of leaking petroleum/chemical storage tanks for pollution prevention Water quality protection components of voluntary cleanup program and state master list sites where controlled hazardous substances remediation is not underway Highway deicing materials storage and efficient salt application equipment Collection and treatment of runoff from municipal airports that has been contaminated by aircraft deicers or other pollutants Land purchase or conservation easements for water quality protection wellheads or watersheds Agricultural BMPs may include 33 of 46 06/23/00         MDE   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment          Grade Control Structures Sediment Control Ponds Manure Storage Facilities Stream Protection (Fencing) Grazing Land Management System (Fencing) Wetlands Creation Enhancement Manure Spreaders, Pumps and Appurtenances  3.9  DETERMINING THE PRIORITY OF PERMIT ISSUANCE 40 CFR 130.5 (b)(9): The process for determining the priority of permit issuance  EPA uses a major/minor classification system for industrial and municipal NPDES permits to provide an initial framework for setting permit issuance priorities. Based on those guidelines, procedures followed by the State of Maryland are discussed in the subsequent paragraphs. Within the existing EPA major permit classification system, a point score is used to identify discharges with high environmental impact. These are placed into the ""major permits"" category. The emphasis is on toxic pollutants, high volumes of environmental pollutants, and thermal pollution. The State may reevaluate a facility's major/minor classification rating, based on new data indicating a toxic effluent, high flow, or any other significant change. Once the distinction between the major and minor permits has been made, the permits of highest priority for issuance are the major permits. Other factors for determining the priority of issuance for industrial surface water discharge permits apply to both minors and majors. The application for a new permit has a higher priority of issuance since the applicant, by law, cannot discharge wastewater before the permit is issued. The permit holder of a permit with an expired date can discharge under the expired permit condition, provided an application for renewal has been submitted to the State. Development of general permits technically represents a grouping of minor permits into one, thus eliminating many hours of administrative work. For this reason, the development of a general permit has the same priority as a major permit. Of highest ranking are the general permits replacing the greatest number of individual minor permits. Discharge permits have been further categorized and grouped according to geographical areas (watersheds). A processing schedule has been established so that permits in the same watershed will be processed during the same time period. A permit with less than half of the effective period remaining when its watershed is being permitted may be processed early for reissuance with all of the permits in the watershed. Other permits may be allowed to expire and then be administratively extended (for no more than 2.5 years) to get on cycle with the other permits in the watershed group. Priorities for processing permit applications will be assigned based on the watershed schedule unless environmental MDE  34 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  concerns or business operating plans require reissuance of a permit in advance of the watershed permit schedule. Maryland has established a watershed permitting approach which incorporates the EPA's major/minor classification system for industrial and municipal NPDES permits. The permit priority procedure can be summarized as follows:     The processing of a major permit has priority over a minor permit. Development of a general permit has the same priority as a major permit. Processing of a new permit application has a higher priority than processing a renewal application. Processing of applications for permit renewals that have passed permit expiration dates have higher priority over applications with permit dates still in effect. Processing of applications will be based on a watershed schedule.    Maryland NPDES Wastewater and Industrial Discharge Permit Backlog EPA Headquarters has identified NPDES Wastewater and Industrial Discharge permit backlog as a material weakness under Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) and set goals to reduce major permit backlog to 20% by 12/31/99, and 10% by 12/31/01. Maryland currently has about 24% major permit backlog. Background: In September 1998, Maryland proposed instituting a watershed approach to NPDES Wastewater and Industrial Discharge permit issuance, which is tied to development of TMDLs. Specifically, Maryland divided the state into five watersheds. The watershed strategy used for TMDL development (extensive monitoring, TMDL modeling, and implementation through permits or Best Management Practices) will coincide with watershed permitting. To place each permit on cycle, Maryland will allow any permit less than 2.5 years old when its watershed is being permitted will not be revoked or reissued unless changing it is of special water quality significance. Later, when an application to renew that permit is received, it will be administratively extended up to 2.5 years to get it on cycle with the other permits in the watershed group. Permits which are older than 2.5 years will be revoked and reissued in the cycle year. This may initially lead to an increase in backlog, but should be eliminated as the watershed approach concludes its first cycle. The first watershed permits should be issued in 2000. Maryland has also historically had a major permit backlog of about 20%. One factor in this backlog is that Maryland's permit appeal process takes place before the permit can be issued whereas EPA's process in other states occurs after issuance. Maryland used to have permittees file renewal applications only, six months prior to expiration. Now the state is requiring earlier submittals to allow more time to reissue the permits. Maryland has a relatively small (14%) minor permit backlog, and has worked on updating information on minors. MDE  35 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  Present Status: The region has discussed the FMFIA permit backlog initiative with Maryland, and Maryland has agreed to make every effort to reduce backlog within their watershed framework.

Over the past three decades or so, the people have spoken clearly and repeatedly of their desire for protection of natural resources, clean-up of pollution, a healthy Chesapeake Bay. These desires find expression in a variety of State laws and regulations covering the range of goals and issues reflected in this Section. Examples of typical Maryland regulations are presented in Appendix B. A major principal of the water quality management toward which the State is moving in its approach to the environment and natural resources is that people are part of the environment; all of the people of Maryland are parts of the ecosystem(s) of the State, their health and quality of life affected by environmental conditions and many of their actions affecting other ecosystem components. Part of the job facing environmental managers at all levels of government is to bring together the social context with the science with which most of them have greater experience and comfort. A two-way communication system is called formaking environmental information available to the people, and hearing from the people their concerns and issues. In the subsequent paragraphs, typical public participation processes are briefly discussed.  4.1  DEVELOPMENT OF TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOADS  Interested parties will be provided with introductory TMDL briefings upon request. A second round of more in-depth briefings will be provided to those who require more detail. The public is invited to become involved in the listing process. A public comment period is provided before the 303(d) list is submitted to EPA. Once work on a specific TMDL begins, local governments in that watershed will be consulted during key stages of development. After a draft TMDL has been developed, a formal public notice and comment period will be provided prior to the TMDL's submission to EPA. Upon the approval of a TMDL by EPA, it will be posted on the MDE's website during the public comment period of generally 30 days. When a TMDL is ready to be implemented, stakeholders will participate in determining which pollution sources should bear the treatment or control burden needed to reach allowable loading levels. Following are the typical examples of activities pertaining to public participation:    Development of Maryland's Lower Delmarva Peninsula TMDLs: TMDL briefings for the Maryland's Lower Delmarva Peninsula were held on June 30, July 15, and July 27, 1999 for the Coastal Bays Region, Lower Eastern Shore, and Choptank River Region, respectively. The department arranged a meeting between EPA and the local governments that was held December 1, 1999 from 10 am to noon at the Howard County Gateway Building in Colombia, MD. The purpose of the meeting was for local governments to discuss their concerns and questions    MDE  41 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  about the federal TMDL and NPDES permit program, and coordination of water resources protection programs in Maryland.    Development of TMDLs for Patapsco/Back Rivers: TMDL briefings for the Patapsco/Back River Watershed were held on December 9, 1999 at Baltimore City Community College  Harbor Campus.  4.2  DEVELOPMENT AND STATE REVIEW OF COUNTY WATER AND SEWERAGE PLANS  Water and Sewerage Plans: Consistent with State law and regulations, each revision, amendment or biennial update of a county water and sewerage plan by local governing bodies requires that a public hearing be held following public notification in newspapers with local and area wide circulation. Copies of these public notices are submitted by the counties along with their biennial updates to Maryland Office of Planing (MOP). State Regulations: Adoption of or amendment to State regulations pertaining to county plans is subject to a public hearing process. State Water Quality Advisory Committee (SWQAC): The SWQAC regularly reviews and comments on the broad range of State laws, policies, and programs that deal with water quality and pollution control. This includes State's water and sewerage plan review and approval process.  4.3  ESTABLISHMEHT OF WATER QUALITY STANDARDS  The CWA requires that all states review their water quality standards every three years. While primary responsibility for water quality decision-making is vested by law in public agencies, active public involvement throughout the intergovernmental decision-making process is a clear priority and in this instance, is required. MDE holds hearing to gain such participation as part of the ongoing process of reviewing Maryland's water quality standards. Announcement of these public hearings will be done through newspapers, Internet and through local governments. The State Water Quality Advisory Committee regularly reviews and comments on proposed regulations. Following are the examples of the public meetings held in 1999:    January 19, January 21, Easton, MD January 26, Hagerstown, 1999 (4 PM to 7:30 PM): Chesapeake Room, MDE, Baltimore, MD 1999 (6:30 PM to 8:30 PM): Meeting Room, Talbot County Free Library, 1999 (7 PM to 9 PM): Room 113, Washington County Office Building, MD  MDE  42 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  These meeting were structured to assure that as many participants as possible have the opportunity to speak. In order to assist the information exchange process, about 30-45 minutes was allowed for informal questions and answers. During the remainder of the hearing, formal comments were received and recorded. Written comments were accepted at the meetings and also for 30 days after the last of the three meetings. MDE strongly encouraged submissions of written statements. More information on the public participation process can be found at MDE website (www.mde.state.md.us/environment/wqsreview.html).  4.4  EFFLUENT LIMITATIONS, WASTELOAD ALLOCATIONS (TMDLs), AND SCHEDULES OF COMPLIANCE FOR WASTEWATER DISCHARGES  A public hearing is held for each discharge permit that is developed. Notices of proposed effluent limitations and the time, date, and location of the public hearing are published in the Maryland Register and in a local newspaper. Members of the public are permitted to visit the Department's offices and review files during working hours. Changes to regulations pertaining to the issuance of discharge permits are subject to a public hearing. The State's discharge permit program is reviewed by the State Water Quality Advisory Committee. Discharge Permits: A public hearing is held for each discharge permit that is developed. In addition, permit files are made available to the interested public. Regulations: Public hearings are required whenever the applicable water quality regulations are revised. State Water Quality Advisory Committee (SWQAC): The State Water Quality Advisory Committee periodically reviews the State's discharge permit program.  4.5  PRIORITY PROCEDURE FOR THE ISSUANCE OF SURFACE WATER DISCHARGE PERMITS RELATING TO WASTEWATER TREATMENT  Permit Issuance: A public hearing is held for each discharge permit before it is issued. Priority Procedure: The priority procedure described above is developed in conformance with EPA policies. These federal policies are made public. Regulations: Changes to regulations pertaining to the issuance of discharge permits are subject to public hearings. SWQAC: The State Water Quality Advisory Committee periodically reviews the State's discharge permit program.  MDE  43 of 46  06/23/00   Draft Continuing Planning Process - for Public Comment  4.6  MANAGEMENT OF RESIDUALS FROM WASTEWATER TREATMENT PROCESSING  Each of the separate regulatory programs contains provisions for public participation. These are detailed below:  Sewage Sludge Management. Upon receipt of an application for agronomic use of sewage sludge, the governing body of a county or municipality in which a sludge project is proposed (or an adjoining county within one mile of the proposed site) my request an informational meeting in the affected jurisdiction. Such a meeting is advertised in a local newspaper at least five days before the meeting. Local officials are notified of the date, time, and location of the meeting. For marginal land reclamation sites, the governing body of a county or municipality (or an adjacent county within one mile of a proposed site) may request a public hearing in the affected jurisdiction. Such a hearing is advertised in a local newspaper at least seven days prior to the hearing. Local officials are notified of the date, time, and location of the hearing. For permanent facilities such as landfills, sludge composting or other facilities, the public hearing is mandatory.  Industrial Waste Residuals. Facilities requiring a hazardous waste permit are subject to the full public participation requirements of requisite federal and State law. Facilities requiring a State discharge permit are subject to the full public hearing process as required by law. Facilities regulated through the 9-217 permit process are not subject to a public hearing. However, applications are forwarded to local officials for review and comment. If requested, and informational meeting is conducted in the affected jurisdiction.  Solid Waste Plans. Each county, as part of their solid waste management plan process, includes provision for public participation. Once the plan is developed and submitted to the Department for review and approval, there is no provision for additional public input. SWQAC. The State Water Quality Advisory Committee periodically reviews the State's residual waste management program.

WMA manages a broad range of activities, including regulating and financing municipal wastewater treatment systems, regulating the use and development of the State's water resources, public water supplies and on-site residential sanitation systems; regulating well-drilling and industrial pretreatment; providing technical assistance for water and wastewater utilities; financing small creek and estuary restoration; approving erosion/sediment control and storm water management plans; storm water permitting; dam permitting and inspection; protection and management of tidal and nontidal wetlands and waters; and regulating mining activities and mitigation problems associated with abandoned mines. These protection, financing and regulatory activities help WMA ensure that State waters are safe for drinking, recreation and wildlife. PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE WMA ARE:  Office of Program Development & Business Services  Office of Administrative Services  Water Quality Infrastructure Program  Nonpoint Source Program  Water/Wastewater Permits Program  Wetlands & Waterways Program  Compliance Program  Mining Program  Water Supply Program THESE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO: Create a focal point for outreach and assistance activities that can address cross-functional issues involving water regulatory programs. Manage water, wastewater, and nonpoint source pollution control capital projects that are funded through grants and loans from the Department. Permit and provide construction inspection for water and sewerage facilities. Develop and implement the new federally mandated storm water permitting program. Issue erosion/sediment control and storm water management plan approvals for state and federal construction projects. Inspect dams for safety, issue new permits, and approve downstream warning plans for high hazard dams. Issue water appropriation permits for use of surface and ground waters. Issue permits for discharges to surface and ground water from both industrial and municipal facilities as required by the federal Clean Water Act. Oversee programs delegated by the Department to local health departments. Activities include MDE's regional consultants who provide technical assistance to local health departments for on-site water and wastewater systems, and assistance in developing and testing new innovative or alternative septic system designs.   Regulate activities conducted in nontidal wetlands and their buffers, and nontidal waterways, including the 100year floodplain. Also, regulates activities conducted in tidal wetlands. Create, restore and enhance nontidal wetlands and streams, provide training and technical assistance and assist in the development of watershed management plans. Inspect industrial and municipal wastewater discharges, coal and surface mining operations, agricultural sites, and construction activities involving sediment control, storm water management, wetlands and waterways. Regulate active mines and mitigate environmental problems associated with abandoned mines. Also, regulate oil and gas exploration, production and storage. Ensure safe drinking water in Maryland by administering the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, developing the State's comprehensive ground water protection program, and responding to local water supply emergencies. Conduct performance evaluations of surface water filtration plants to assist systems in optimizing treatment and reducing the risk of passing Cryptosporidium (a protozoan parasite that can infect humans) into the finished water. Train public water and wastewater treatment operators and provide on-site technical assistance to support the State's operator certification program and achieve compliance and pollution prevention goals. Finance storm water management practices and small creek and estuary restoration projects. The Environmental Boards are comprised of three State licensing boards, established by the General Assembly. Also located within the Water Management Administration, the Boards were created to license and certify individuals as:   Environmental Sanitarians;  Superintendents and operators of waterworks, wastewater works, industrial wastewater works, wastewater collection systems and waste water distribution systems; and   Well drillers, water conditioner and water pump installers. The Environmental Boards screen applicants wanting to enter the professions, administer competency examinations, evaluate continuing education as a prerequisite for license renewal, and take disciplinary action against those licensees found guilty of violating the law.   3.01 SURFACE WATER DISCHARGE PERMIT (INDUSTRIAL) PURPOSE The industrial surface water discharge permit is a combined state and federal permit under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). This permit is issued for industrial facilities that discharge to State surface waters. The permit is designed to meet federal effluent guidelines when applicable and also ensure the discharge satisfies State water quality standards. All industrial, commercial or institutional facilities that discharge wastewater (or storm water from certain facilities) to surface waters of Maryland need this permit. Alternatively, an industrial discharge to the municipal wastewater collection system may require a pretreatment permit. 5) The Department issues the permit if adverse comments are not received. 6) If adverse comments are received, the Department prepares a final determination and publishes additional notice providing 15 days to request a contested case hearing. 7) The Department issues the permit if the final determination is not contested. 8) If contested, administrative procedures for the appeal process are followed.

Glendening's recent State of the State address, this year's legislative package and budget contain many initiatives to improve water quality. These initiatives are designed to prepare the state for a recurrence of the events of last summer as well as lessen the possibility of similar outbreaks in the future. In large part, these initiatives are based on the recommendations of the Governor's Blue Ribbon Citizens Pfiesteria Action Commission, which was chaired by former Governor Harry Hughes. Preparing Maryland for a Possible Recurrence of Pfiesteria Human Health Maryland's efforts to study the impact of Pfiesteria's toxins on humans placed the state as a national leader on this issue. Last summer, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene established a surveillance system to gather information about human illnesses that may be related to these toxins. The Department will  Photo by Michelle Armiger, MDE.  continue that surveillance system and maintain a central registry of all possible and confirmed cases of clinical manifestations of toxicity from Pfiesteria. Information collected in the registry will be used to initiate appropriate epidemiological studies. The Department will also enhance its  outreach efforts to physicians to provide information about the symptoms of exposure to Pfiesteria's toxins in order to ensure that possible cases are properly treated and reported. The Department will perform these functions within existing resources  Milestone Agreement To Be Signed Between State and the EPA By Bob Hoyt and John Mitchell A milestone performance partnership agreement will soon be signed between the Maryland Departments of the Environment and Natural Resources, and the U.S. Environmental Agency (EPA) that will improve the effectiveness of Maryland's environmental programs and strengthen state/ federal relationships. The Agreement is a comprehensive strategic plan that identifies the state's important environmental goals, describes the programs in place to achieve those goals, and establishes ways to measure progress. This process is an essential first step in determining whether there are better ways to achieve our environmental goals. If there are, subsequent Agreements with EPA could authorize the necessary flexibility to implement the needed improvements and lead to the authorization of multiyear grants, reduced paperwork, more effective EPA assistance and other significant benefits for Maryland and our environment. The Environmental Partnership is a component of the National Environmental Performance Partnership System (NEPPS). EPA, with input and encouragement from the states, created NEPPS in 1995 as a new approach designed to provide greater flexibility, improved environmental results, administrative savings and strengthened partnerships between the states and the EPA. Many states see performance partnership agreements as a way to rely less on activity based requirements, i.e., the number of inspections, site visits, compliance assistance, and enforcement activities, and more on measuring environmental and public health improvements. To date, over 30 states have signed performance partnership agreements. As an added benefit to Maryland, the participating state agencies have incorporated the performance partnership Process into Governor Glendening's Managing Maryland For Results benchmarking requirements  Visit MDE's home page at http://www.mde.state.md.us  (continued on page 2)   MDEnvironment February 1998 MDEnvironment is a monthly newspaper published by the Maryland Department of the Environment.

Environmental Partnership Agreement for improving services to Marylanders. The process also is consistent with the Maryland General Assembly's directive to improve various units of measurements and to focus management toward environmental and public health outcomes. These strategic projects were combined into one comprehensive effort because they all are based on results based planning. The Performance Partnership process has unfolded over the past year and half in Maryland. In addition to MDE, DNR and EPA, the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) has also participated by investing significant time and resources to ensure a successful effort. First, the agencies drafted the goals and indicators document which identified the state's public health, environmental, and natural resource goals and established indicators to measure progress. Next, the agencies assessed their program's track record at achieving the goals and finally, developed a work plan that aligns program activities with goals. It is important to understand that during the first year of the Partnership, the State agencies will not be doing anything different. Over the past year and a half, the agencies have been developing a clear idea of their environmental and public health goals and obligations and evaluating how well the state's activities and programs line up with these goals. During the upcoming year, programs will be analyzed with the mission of determining how we can be more effective in achieving our goals. To ensure the highest level of public involvement, MDE, DNR, MDA, and EPA held two sets of public meetings throughout five regions of the state. Additionally, the agencies' stakeholder groups received frequent briefings and provided invaluable feedback. As the Performance Partnership continues, the agencies will seek to increase the level of public participation. ""Citizens have been asked to play an important role in developing the Agreement that is unprecedented in any other state. Public involvement in Maryland's efforts to restore and protect its valuable natural resources is absolutely essential if these efforts are to have any hope of success,""said Secretary of Environment Jane T. Nishida. ""Individual citizens must be fully informed, their opinions elicited and concerns heard.""  Pfiesteria Plan and will coordinate its work with the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University as necessary. The Department will also continue its efforts to work with the Centers for Disease Control's ongoing projects pertaining to Pfiesteria- like organisms and harmful algal blooms. Seafood Marketing Maryland's seafood industry was negatively impacted by the perception that it was unsafe to eat fish from Maryland waters. Governor Glendening authorized the expenditure of $500,000 in FY98 for a marketing effort to restore consumer confidence in the state's seafood. This effort proved to be a tremendous success. The Governor's FY99 budget will include $500,000 to continue this effort. In both FY 2000 and FY 2001, the Governor intends to provide $250,000 for this purpose. Rapid Response Teams The state's toll-free hotline to inform the state about possible Pfiesteria outbreaks worked well. It allowed the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to respond quickly to potential problems. The Governor's budget contains $1 million and several positions to continue both the hotline and the Department's rapid response teams. These teams go to the site of possible fish health problem, and sample fish, sediment and water quality to determine if the fish health problems pose a risk to human health. Their sampling information provides the state with the data needed to comply with the protocol for closing and opening rivers. Environmental Monitoring The Governor's FY99 budget includes $630,000 and 6 positions to allow the Department of the Environment to evaluate the magnitude of various sources of environmental pollution in affected watersheds. MDE will monitor nutrient and toxic pollution from regulated point sources and nonpoint sources including agricultural, urban and residential areas.

The Governor supports the role of the federal government as coordinator of research on harmful algal blooms. The Governor's budget will contain a one-time appropriation of $800,000 (budgeted in the Department of the Environment) to provide our Universities and research institutions with important seed money to assist in their competing for these federal research grants. Water Quality Initiatives The best available scientific evidence indicates that elevated nutrient levels contribute to the development of Pfiesteria, Pfiesteria-like organisms and other harmful algal blooms. We have long been aware that nutrients are, in general, detrimental to water quality. The Governor's package acknowledges that all of us contribute to nutrient loading in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The Hughes Commission recommended a multisource approach to solving this problem. The Governor will propose legislation, appropriate money and refocus agency resources to reduce the amount of nutrients that end up in our waters. The Governor will establish an Oversight Committee, as recommended by the Hughes Commission. This group will oversee the development of alternative uses of manure; oversee the implementation of appropriate nutrient management programs and best management practices; work with interested groups and state agencies and; prepare semi-annual reports on their progress. Sewage Treatment Plant Upgrades Biological nutrient removal (BNR) cost-sharing is an essential element of the state and local approach to achieve the Chesapeake Bay 40 percent reduction goal of reducing nitrogen from point sources. The Governor's five-year capital budget program will be adjusted to implement BNR upgrades at all 14 targeted sewage treatment plants on the Eastern Shore within 3 years and all remaining eligible sewage treatment plants statewide within five years. In order to complete the necessary upgrades on the Eastern Shore, additional funds were added to the FY99 capital budget.

As is the current practice, the departments of Agriculture and the Environment will work with farmers to achieve compliance with nutrient management plans. The Governor's bill includes several penalties that can be used if a farm is noncompliant. Possible sanctions are civil penalties, the recovery of MACS cost-share expenditures and a limit on the expansion of the farm operations of a noncompliant farm. Research projects. The Governor's budget includes $800,000 for three years to conduct research projects designed to reduce nutrient loading in the Bay and its tributaries. As the Hughes Commission noted, in several areas Maryland cannot wait for national research to be completed. It is anticipated that immediate research will be needed on issues such as alternative uses of manure, animal nutrition and agronomic practices. This research funding is budgeted in the Department of the Environment and will be distributed to Maryland Universities and research institutions.  El Nio and Emergency Preparedness in Maryland by Visty Dalal and George Harman The El Nio weather phenomenon has been blamed for a number of odd occurrences from the recent devastating ice storms in the northeast to the torrential rainstorms in the west. El Nio is a disruption of the oceanatmosphere system in the tropical Pacific, causing warm currents along the west coast of the Americas, and having important consequences for weather around the globe, and here in Maryland Normally, northeasterly trade winds off of Peru and Ecuador blow warm tropical waters towards Asia, and allow cold, nutrient rich waters to upwell along the Pacific coast of the Americas. However, when the trade winds weaken, conditions reverse themselves, and warm tropical waters pile up against the West coast of the Americas. During a strong El Nio event, the Asian nations are more likely to experience drought conditions and the Americans tend to receive higher than normal amounts of precipitation. The U.S. is expected to experience warmer than normal conditions in the northwest, wetter conditions across the southern states, and drier conditions in the Ohio valley. On average, Maryland is expected to experience normal temperatures and precipitation. The benefits of El Nio in Maryland are a decreased risk of hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes and their associated flooding. However, major snowstorms have twice the chance of occurring, largely the result of a tendency for more coastal storms. ""There is....an increased risk of `Noreaster' storms that can cause shoreline flooding and erosion, and the potential for a major snowstorm,"" said Barbara McNaughtWatson, Warning Coordination Meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sterling, Virginia. Although these conditions may not occur, they are more likely than in non-El Nio years. In response to this increased potential for major snowstorms Governor Glendening directed the Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) to develop a Readiness Action Plan for El Nio. MEMA is coordinating with the Maryland Department of the Environment, other state emergency response agencies, county governments, and private emergency response groups in Maryland. MEMA's plan includes the creation of an El Nio monitoring and coordination group; enhancing emergency response exercises related to coastal storms; refining MEMA's existing Internet website (www.mema.state.md.us); requesting an increase in the Catastrophic Event Fund; and establishing a toll-free phone number (800-422-8799) for citizens to access important information.  page 3   MDEnvironment Maryland's Tributary Strategy Teams Maryland's Tributary Strategy Teams were created in 1994 and charged with the gargantuan task of implementing tributary strategies to meet the 40 percent nutrient reduction goals set initially by the 1987 Chesapeake Bay Executive. Recognizing that what works in one geographic area may not work for another, teams were assigned to focus on individual basins. The ten teams consist of a cross section of Marylanders appointed by the Governor including business, community, agricultural, local government and environmental organization representatives, all who live in the area in which they volunteer. Monthly meetings are held by each of the teams to look at how Maryland can answer the pleas of a stressed Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. For the next ten months, MDEnvironment will feature updates from these ten tributary teams. Contributing writers from the teams will focus on their basin and the strategies being reviewed which will move Chesapeake Bay Watershed protection into the 21st century.  Progress in the Patapsco/Back: An Update by Wayne Jenkins & Rich Eskin, MDE The Patapsco/Back River Tributary Strategy Implementation Team, or Trib Team, promotes Maryland's nutrient reduction goals for the Patapsco River and Back River watersheds. The strategy recommends a variety of point and nonpoint source controls to achieve reductions in nutrient loadings. Strategies for controlling nutrients, namely nitrogen and phosphorus, have been established for each of the ten major basins in the state that drain to the Chesapeake Bay. Given the urban nature of the Patapsco/Back watershed, this team has focused on point source, stormwater management and stream restoration issues as priorities. Last year, the team cosponsored a conference on the financing of environmental mandates for local governments. Over 70 attendees helped form the consensus that a workgroup was needed to address stormwater funding issues on a regional basis. After writing local elected officials suggesting that the Baltimore Metropolitan Council (BMC) create such a group, plans began to form the BMC financing workgroup. The team will work with the BMC and continue to highlight this important issue. Other activities of the team include oversight of a Clean Water Act Section 316 grant received last year. Working through Baltimore County and the State Highway Administration, the team is  Patapsco/Back River Basin analyzing data from stream restoration projects across the Piedmont region to identify ways that stream restoration designs in the Patapsco/Back watershed can be improved. Local jurisdictions that wish to implement flexible design criteria for more liveable and environmentally friendly communities often find that existing laws and regulations can be stifling. To identify solutions to this problem, the Patapsco/Back team will host a workshop in Woodlawn on February 27. ""Designing for Liveable Communities and Healthier Watersheds: Rewriting the Rules,"" will identify areas where regulations need to be adjusted and reviews coordinated to achieve multiple goals. It is the teams hope that attendees can help solve this complex problem. The workshop is open to the public. Please contact Catherine Rappe at (410)857-2150. The team also is planning to reach out to state senators and delegates to educate them on the team's activities in restoring the Bay. The focus of this effort will be a reception for the local delegation to take place during this legislative session. The Patapsco/Back team is making a difference in the helping to restore the Chesapeake Bay. The Team meets monthly and all meetings are open to the public. Visitors are welcome and encouraged to participate.

National Dam Safety Program Act Implementation After nearly six years of congressional campaigning and lobbying, the Association of State Dam Safety Officials (ASDSO) is celebrating the passage, funding and implementation of the National Dam Safety Program Act of 1996. Ninety-five percent of the United States 75,000 dams are regulated by individual states. This important program supports state dam safety efforts by providing training for state dam safety engineers, incentive grants to improve state's programs and funding for technical and archival research to develop improved techniques for evaluating, monitoring and rehabilitating dams. Brad Iarossi, MDE's Chief of the Dam Safety Division and current ASDSO President -Elect, has been the Chairman of the Legislative Committee and has spent many hours in Washington D.C. seeking support for the program. ""Implementation of this program will provide valuable training for Maryland's dam safety engineers that otherwise would be too costly to attend,"" said Iarossi. ""It will advance dam safety research and provide modest grant funds to improve Maryland's dam safety programs."" Senator Christopher ""Kit"" Bond (DMissouri) was instrumental in sponsoring the Act and in securing the full funding. Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, ranking minority member, David Bowers and Sally Chadborne of her staff, and Peter Kyriacopolous of Governor Glendening's Washington Office provided local support. Senator Mikulski was invaluable in obtaining full funding of $2.9 million during budget reductions, downsizing, and heavy competition for limited funds.

The project is a three-year grantfunded project to develop compliance training materials such as videos and technical guides for use in a series of regional workforce training sessions. The sessions will be tailored to address one or more priority compliance training needs for a given business sector. At present, six sectors are involved including aggregates production, ready-mix concrete, home-building, marinas, printing, and paper manufacturing. At a December workshop, participants brain stormed about what compliance issues should be considered priorities to address in the creation of training materials and sessions for each participating business sector. In the coming months, MDE, in cooperation with MCET and participating community colleges will develop more detailed training objectives and materials for each of the participating business sector's compliance training effort based upon the outcomes of the brainstorming sessions. In addition to MDE and MHEC, cosponsors of the workshop included the Maryland Chamber of Commerce, the Department of Business and Economic Development, and the Maryland Center for Environmental Training (MCET) of Charles County Community College, with funding provided by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Participating community colleges include Charles County Community College, Allegany College of Maryland, Anne Arundel Community College, the Community Colleges of Baltimore County (Catonsville), Chesapeake College and Wor-Wic Community College. Montgomery College has also voiced support for the MBICAP effort. For more information about MBICAP, or to become a participating community college, contact Marie Halka (MDE) at 410-631-3560.  The Gunpowder watershed which spans Baltimore, Carroll, Harford Counties and York County, Pennsylvania has a drainage area of 303 square miles and provides an average of 180 million gallons of drinking water per day for the Baltimore Metropolitan Region. In spite of extensive rural conservation zoning, there are continuing pressures for additional suburban development in the watershed. Local residents, voicing their concerns about the impact of continued development, urged the governments involved to make a change. The result is the Gunpowder Watershed Project, a three year study designed to use the strengths of federal, state and local agencies in partnership to address major issues impacting this key regional resource. The project is the first study of its kind to assess source protection, stormwater, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination permits, and growth issues and the link between the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. The focus of the project is on assessing the condition of Loch Raven and Pretty Boy Reservoirs as sources of drinking water, evaluating stormwater impacts to surface water quality, and assessing potential impacts from land use changes. The concept of watershed planning is an effective way to link environmental programs in a geographical area. The Gunpowder study represents an ambitious project that will depend on continued community support to ensure its success. To establish this community involvement, a public participation committee has been formed with residents from throughout the Baltimore Metropolitan Region. Advice and input into the project's direction, development of public educational opportunities, and integration of residents' concerns, are some of the tasks these project partners  will undertake. The committee also will help also to identify additional funding sources to complete all aspects of the proposed study. Five significant source water protection goals have been identified: 1) Determine the rate of reservoir sedimentation, significant sources, and the impact on reservoir storage and treatability of raw water; 2) Relate the tributary loadings to a decrease in dissolved oxygen, water quality parameters and algal dynamics; 3) Measure pathogen contamination in feeder streams and different reservoir locations and evaluate the reservoirs as a treatment zone; 4) Characterize potential risk to reservoirs from toxics, spills, or run-off and identify high risk locations to improve emergency response; and 5) Determine level of disinfectant byproduct precursors and the most effective methods for reducing potential formation. There is a pressing need to evaluate the contributions of loadings from nonpoint sources (urban stormwater and agricultural run-off) within the watershed. Additionally, the data gathered from this monitoring effort will be used to determine current watershed conditions and establish future improvement. The habitat value and recreational opportunities within the drainage basin and the need to protect this valuable water supply make the Gunpowder watershed ideal for use as a model for watershed assessment and planning. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a process that can be used to create a national model for the cooperative performance of watershed assessment and planning by incorporating close coordination between all levels of government and the public.

P2 AND WASTE MINIMIZATION by Neil Thompson If there was a simple, cost-effective, faster and more environmentally sound approach to any business situation, it stands to reason that most companies -- big or small--would take advantage of the cost savings, reap the benefits of the efficiency, and publicize their new and improved ""greener"" way of thinking. Smart companies all across Maryland are doing just that by participating in voluntary programs such as the Maryland Department of the Environment's pollution prevention/(P2)waste minimization programs and training. Maryland law requires that all hazardous waste generators take steps to minimize their waste. MDE also has made commitments to emphasize and promote p2/waste minimization in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Grant. P2/waste minimization efforts for hazardous waste currently are focused on companies in the PatapscoBack River basin that generate 25 tons or more of hazardous waste a year, produce waste that contains at least one of a list of chemicals that are persistent, bioaccumulative, and/or toxic (PBT), and the site is located in an area of concern. MDE staff have a GIS mapping system to assist in the identification of this priority list of generators. MDE staff conduct site assessments to determine the status of the generator's P2 efforts and measures the generator's progress in accomplishing source reduction, waste minimization and recycling of hazardous waste. Reports are received (continued on page 6)  page 5   MDEnvironment continued from page 5....  P2 from the Hazardous Waste Program staff concerning the status of P2/ waste minimization efforts at generator sites where compliance evaluation inspections have been conducted. Follow up visits are then conducted to provide guidance to the generator and identify areas where P2/waste minimization can be achieved. In addition, MDE maintains a technical clearinghouse of new products and technologies useful for hazardous waste reduction. The department also shares with the EPA in their analysis of regulatory concerns which would facilitate waste minimization. Throughout the watershed basin, basic changes are being made in the way these companies do business and generate hazardous waste because of these new waste minimization ideas. One company now uses computerized inventory management systems to track and maintain information on the purchase, use and disposition of materials and supplies. This practice avoids out-of-date raw materials and minimizes their disposal. Another business installed new solvent recovery units to recycle and reuse solvents several times before disposing. In manufacturing industries less or non- toxic raw materials are being substituted for chemicals that are considered hazardous. For one company simply improving equipment cleaning techniques to reduce the volume of water used and wastewater  generated reduced the amount of total waste produced. Retrofitting a production line so that precise amounts of raw materials are added by machine instead of manually will increase precision and avoid off specification batches that eventually have to be disposed of. MDE staff has worked with large quantity generators in; developing P2/ waste minimization plans; recommending treatment processes to reduce volume and/or toxicity of hazardous waste streams (such as neutralization of acid /base waste to lower disposal costs; use of evaporators to reduce volume of aqueous waste containing heavy metals; installation of membrane technologies which reduce considerably the concentration of suspended solids,  organic compounds or metals in aqueous waste streams); implementing good housekeeping procedures and improving operational practices to avoid spills and bad batches and evaluating the use of aqueous-based cleaners rather than solvent-based products. The above P2/waste minimization practices benefit industries through substantial cost savings in hazardous waste disposal, reduce their environmental liability, reduce governmental/ regulatory concerns, and improve working conditions and the environment. If your company wants to get in on this new, greener way of thinking (and save some money in the bargain), please contact Alvin Bowles at (410)631-3441.

Waste Minimization Management Practices  By Phil Heard Are there toxic chemicals in my drinking water, in my community river or at a nearby abandoned waste site? Are these toxic chemicals at dangerous levels? What risk am I taking if I eat, drink, or breathe these contaminants? Will I get sick? Is environmental clean up needed? How much contamination is too much? It is the Maryland Department of the Environment's (MDE) responsibility to answer these questions through a process called risk assessment. Risk assessment identifies the potential adverse effects to humans or ecosystems resulting from exposure to environmental hazards. In practice, risk assessment means that raw data are put into a practical form, ready for use by decision-makers. Risk assessment is used to set  Toxic chemicals in the environment: Evaluating the risk to human health remediation goals for Superfund sites, brownfields and other sites subject to some type of pollution impact. It also is an invaluable tool for responding to calls from the community when an evaluation of health risk can allay fears or signal a need for action. There is a four step process to evaluate the threat to human health posed by toxic chemicals: (1) determine if the chemical is inherently toxic, (2) identify the dose of the chemical that can cause illness, (3) determine the exposure that people are receiving or may receive in the real world, and (4) based on the previous information, estimate the likelihood that adverse health effects will result. The first two steps require years of research in animal and human populations which is an on-going effort. Federal and international institutions, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the International Agency for Research on Cancer have generated a large body of information about the disease potential of many chemicals offering guidance on what constitutes safe levels for many environmental toxics. When specific guidelines do not exist or when they are inappropriate for use in Maryland, MDE adopts more general guidelines and modifies them to reflect the best science currently available. Risk assessors at MDE begin involvement during the third step of risk assessment, called ""exposure assessment."" This step carefully considers the reported contaminants and their levels, the movement and ultimate fate of contaminants in a particular environmental setting, and human behaviors that might increase or decrease the exposure to chemicals. In practice, the risk assessor develops a scenario, adopting assumptions as needed, and estimates the amount of a chemical that individuals will take in as a result of breathing, eating, drinking, and skin contact. Finally, the risk assessor compares the two pieces of information: the recommended safety level and the real-life exposure. A judgement is then made as to whether or not adverse effects will occur. Next Month, Mdenvironment will take a look at environmental risk assessment which goes beyond the human health risks and takes into account how MDE calculates risk for the wild things in our state.  page 6   Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing: An Update For Our Children the property owner elects not to register. No liability protection is afforded to those property owners who do not register their properties. Census data shows that there were 347,299 rental units in Maryland in properties built between 1949 and 1979. The statute requires that a portion of the fees collected each year be dedicated to community outreach and education. The Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning has been awarded a contract to provide information to both property owners and tenants who need assistance with the Qualified Offer process. The Qualified Offer process is the mechanism established by the law to provide for the relocation and medical care that  by Alvin Bowles, Jerry Gietka and Barbara conrad The Maryland Department of the Environment is Maryland's primary agency in managing the reduction of the health risk from lead-based paint. The Lead Poisoning Prevention Program is tasked to carry out the mandates established by HB 760, the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act. Its activities involve: a property registration program for rental properties; an accreditation program for training providers, inspectors, and supervisors; the childhood registry for tracking blood lead reports; and enforcement. The primary cause of childhood lead poisoning is lead paint. The act attempts to reduce the incidence of childhood lead poisoning while maintaining available affordable rental housing. While the statute does not require abatement or removal of lead  paint, it does establish a standard of care intended to both protect the resident from harm and the property owner from liability. The act itself is intended to be preventive. This is a new approach, which will hopefully stop lead poisonings before they happen. Despite the best efforts of all concerned, some children in Maryland remain lead poisoned. All incidents of elevated blood lead (EBL) must be reported by laboratories to the Lead Poisoning Prevention Childhood Lead registry at MDE. Last year, over 65,000 such reports were received. MDE lead program personnel are working with local health departments to ensure that notices are sent to parents and property owners for any verified blood lead level at or above 15 micrograms per deciliter (uL/DL). Modified risk reduction is required within 30 days of receipt of a notice of EBL at or above 15 uL/ DL. The intent is to insure that children receive care and that risk reduction is performed at the residence before the child is damaged irreparably by the lead in their system. Relocation is recommended when the EBL reaches 25 uL/DL. This early response should allow for a reduction in the overall incidence of lead poisoning among children in Maryland. In 1994 census data shows that the population of children under 6 years of age in Maryland (the  primary risk group along with pregnant women) is at 450,948. Only 59,746 (13%) of that population was screened for lead in the 1996 calendar year. Of those screened, over 8,000 had been exposed. The law requires an owner of any property built before 1950 containing at least one rental dwelling unit to register that property. The age of the resident is not a factor. This registration must be renewed each before December 31. An owner of a property built after 1949 may also take advantage of the liability protection if he or she elects to by registering that property. There is no requirement that a property built after 1949 be registered. Those properties built before 1950 and those built afterwards who owners elected to register are called ""affected properties."" Each year, the Department sends notices to owners of registered ""affected properties"" reminding them of the requirements to renew. Available census data shows that there were 159,107 units in the state built before 1950. As of 9/30/97, the registry had received registrations covering only 75,458 units in ""affected properties."" The law also requires that every property built before 1979 containing a rental unit pay a $5 per unit fee even if  Printed on recycled paper with soybean ink  Maryland Department of the Environment 2500 Broening Highway Baltimore MD 21224 US Postage Paid Rockville, MD Permit No. 4212  may be required. No action may be taken against a property owner in compliance with the law unless they have the opportunity to make a Qualified Offer. The Qualified Offer limits the owner's liability to $17,000; the total consists of $9,500 for relocation expenses and $7,500 for medically necessary expenses. The monies are paid to the provider upon receipt of invoices for the services necessary for location and medical assistance.

During the 4th annual meeting of Maryland's Tributary Teams Jan. 22, accolades were given to citizens, organizations and businesses for their significant contributions in restoring the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Former Maryland Gov. Harry R. Hughes presented the Chesapeake Bay Trust's annual Ellen Fraites-Wagner Award for exceptional environmental protection achievement. The award was given to Pat and Ed Nielsen of Centreville. The Nielsens founded the Chester River Association and have actively supported land preservation and watershed protection efforts on the Eastern Shore. In accepting the award Ed Nieslen said, ""The tributary teams are one of the great steps forward in bringing the Bay's restoration to the community level, and that's where the battle will be won or lost."" The Chesapeake Bay Trust is a nonprofit organization that provides financial support grants to civic and community organizations, schools and volunteer groups for Chesapeake Bay restoration and education projects in Maryland. Ellen FraitesWagner was the impetus behind the formation of the trust, which began in 1985. To date, the trust has awarded more than 3,500 grants totaling more than $5 million. The trust raises financial support from the sale of Treasure the Chesapeake commemorative Bay license plates, contributions via the line 40 tax checkoff on the Maryland State Income Tax form, and private donations.

Porcari This is part of an occasional series of articles from the Maryland Department of Transportation, on its efforts to protect the environment. Better coordination of land-use and transportation. That's a central theme in the on-going public debate about how to address congestion, air pollution, suburban sprawl and economic development. While it's also been a priority of Gov. Parris N. Glendening's Smart Growth and Neighborhood Conservation program, more work is being done in Maryland to consider how our transportation infrastructure investments in Maryland affect growth. Hundreds gathered in December at the Smart Growth/Smart Transportation Conference to learn more about Smart Transportation and brainstorm on ways for the state and local governments to better work together to achieve it. Sponsored by the Maryland Department of Transportation, the Maryland State Highway Administration and the Maryland Office of Planning, the conference brought together state planners implementing Smart Growth, local land-use and transportation planners, public-works leaders and environmental group representatives. ""Transportation projects are major state investments that can become the catalyst for economic development and neighborhood revitalization,"" Governor Glendening said, in his keynote address during the conference. ""Or  as in the past  they can divide neighborhoods and accelerate the decline of our downtowns and older communities. We must work together and more aggressively to use transportation resources and projects to stabilize and improve the quality of life in our established areas. That is what Smart Growth and Smart Transportation are all about."" Smart Growth calls for counties to define Priority Funding Areas, where the state will concentrate infrastructure inGrowth has overshadowed what it will fund. It is important to note that Smart growth does not mean no growth. We will actually see an increased level of funding for transportation projects  just redirected. Now that counties and municipalities have defined Priority Funding Areas, we thought the conference participants could help us examine Smart Growth issues extending beyond PFAs, influencing transportation program decisions and environmental resource protection. During the conference, participants broke out into groups for discussions. Topics included:  Programs to promote transit usage under Smart Growth principals.  Coordinating land use and transportation planning decision making  Pedestrian and bicycle issues and Smart Growth  Relationships between Adequate Public Facilities and Smart Growth  MDOT Neighborhood Conservation Programs  Eligibility issues for State Highway projects Ideas coming out of these brainstorming sessions are being compiled and will be distributed back to the participants.

Maryland's Tributary Teams are working to make a difference in neighborhoods, cities and towns across the state, a difference that will result in cleaner, healthier tributaries and the Chesapeake Bay. Maryland's Tributary Teams meet regularly in each of the Bay's 10 major tributaries to help implement pollution prevention meas ures needed to address local water quality problems. These teams are laying the groundwork to ensure clean water and healthy rivers for future generations. A major focus of their efforts is controlling nutrient pollution from suburban and urban properties, farm fields and horse pastures, wastewater treatment plants, construction and road building activities.   Page 4-MDENVIRONMENT-Tuesday, February 1, 2000  MDE seeks water pollution control grantees Bianca fills Even as the legislature takes up issues pertaining to the state's fiscal year 2001 budget, Maryland's Department of the Environment (MDE) is already thinking ahead to fiscal 2002. Early last month, counties, cities and towns should have received a ""solicitation letter"" and various attachments explaining MDE's grant and loan programs for water pollution control. This packet of information contained a blank ""pre-application"" to be completed and returned to MDE by the end of February. Pre-applications received by MDE will be used to rate and rank proposed wastewater, drinking water and non-point source projects according to severity of public health and water quality problems, compliance status, and location within an impaired waterway and other factors. Project schedule and readiness to proceed will also be considered. Projects will be selected for inclusion in the state's fiscal 2002 capital budget request and in MDE's request for funds from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Drinking Water and Water Quality Loan programs. Grant funds approved by the General Assembly will become available to the selected projects effective July 1, 2001. Loan funds from this round of funding become available October 1, 2000. MDE may offer a grant/loan combination to a local government. Projects may also be funded by MDE in combination with other agencies' support such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service, EPA, or Community Development Block grants. All projects must go through the state clearinghouse process, environmental reviews, and be approved by the Board of Public Works. In addition, MDE must review and approve engineering contracts, plans, and specifications and bid packages to ensure compliance with state and federal laws and regulations. Prevailing wage rates may apply to certain state grants, and women/minority business participation goals may apply.

They are required to deliver quality programs and plan for the future in the face of uncertainty. These management challenges require well-developed skills in a number of areas, including strategic planning, team building, persuasion and public relations, and information technology. With these thoughts in mind, Maryland's Department of the Environment (MDE) presented a very successful training program for Maryland's recycling coordinators and solid waste managers, held early last month at the Bon Secours Center in Marriottsville. The program's keynote speaker, Lanier ""Lannie"" Hickman, former executive director of the Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA), launched the training with a look at the changes and challenges facing the solid waste industry. His presentation was followed by a panel discussion entitled,""What if it Happens Here in Maryland,"" which focused on unpredictable factors that could occur in Maryland's solid waste and recycling industries. The panel included: Richard Collins, director of MDE's Waste Management Administration; Chaz Miller, acting director of State Programs with Environmental Industry Association; Robin Davidov, executive director of the Northeast, Maryland Waste Disposal Authority; Jim Litke, recycling coordinator for the Town of Aberdeen, and Dennis Bigley, research and development manager for Prince George's County's Waste Management Division. Each panelist was asked to describe what the largest issue facing waste management and recycling professionals would be in the 21st century. The ensuing discussion ranged from the effects of interstate transportation to volatile markets in recycling commodities. Over the next two days, participants were given ""nuts-and-bolts"" training in strategic planning, leadership skills, interdisciplinary team approaches to problem solving, effective presentations, dealing with the press, interacting with legislators and technological approaches to information management in the next century. One of the important course objectives was to implement the recommendations of the Governor 's 1998 Solid Waste Management Task Force. State Sen. Roy Dyson, Del. Bill Bronrott and lobbyist Pamela Metz Kasemeyer provided invaluable insight into the legislative process. Sen. Dyson and Del.

When released, the water travels through a pipe called a penstock and is delivered to a turbine for electricity generation. Although it is non-polluting and inexpensive, hydropower can have significant impacts on the environment. When dams are created in bodies of water, they can destroy natural habitats and interfere with natural processes such as fish migration. Dams also restrict the movement within a body of water, decreasing the amount of oxygen available for species that live in the water. When built over dry land, they can destroy wetlands or fertile areas that could otherwise be used for crops. Dams can also cause severe flooding when there is a break.  PANELS  Continued from Page 1 from a 1990 baseline;  Increase the use of solar power as a source of energy;  Develop cleaner fuels, such as low-sulfur premium gasoline, which is already available in several markets throughout the country. ""The company is considering incorporating solar panels into the design of its new stations, and, perhaps later this year, we'll start to see more stations like Fletcher 's Amoco,"" said Larson. The use of solar power to generate electricity has a very minimal effect on the environment. The solar panels produce no emissions, use no fuel (except sunlight) and are silent. And the manufacture of the panels is also environmentally-friendly. BP Solarex makes extensive use of recycled materials and even uses wastes from other industries as raw materials when making the panels. In addition, the panels are designed to last nearly 30 years. BP-Amoco's concern for the environment can also be seen in its commitment to Businesses for the Bay , the Chesapeake Bay Program's voluntary pollution prevention program for facilities in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. ""Businesses for the Bay is the most effective alliance of businesses, individuals and other organizations working toward a common goal: protecting the Chesapeake Bay,"" said Larson. ""BP-Amoco is glad to be a part of such a program."" ""BP-Amoco's solar project at Fletcher's Amoco is a great example of how businesses can help to prevent pollution,"" said Kelly Mecum, coordinator for Businesses for the Bay. ""Their work to protect the environment should be commended."" For more information about Businesses for the Bay, contact Kelly Mecum, Businesses for the Bay Coordinator, at 1-800 YOUR BAY, extension 719.  Why the recent interest in renewable energy? Renewable energies are not a new concept. In fact, most devices for using renewable energies are based on older concepts. However, the increasing rate of energy consumption and the desire to find less polluting and more diverse ways to produce electricity have created more recent interest. Finding less polluting ways to produce electricity has become of special interest since many states, including Maryland, are restructuring the electric utility industry. In the past, government-regulated monopolies have provided electricity for Maryland at rates set by the Public Service Commission. Restructuring the electric utility industry will promote competition among electricity providers and give Maryland consumers a choice in who provides their electricity. This presents an opportunity to increase the use of renewable energies. Increased use will help reduce pollution in the environment and will reduce the use of limited natural resources that will run out one day. Obtaining electricity from renewable energy sources also allows us to diversify our energy supply and increase our energy security.  In cooperation with BP-Amoco and its subsidiary, BP Solarex, Fletcher installed 144 solar panels at his station as part of a pilot project. The project was designed to demonstrate how solar power can be used to generate electricity for commercial businesses and residential buildings. The solar modules at Fletcher 's Amoco generate six kilowatts of electricity , which is enough to power some lighting and equipment inside the station's store. Unlike some solar electric applications, this system is connected to the local utility rather than to a storage battery. That means Fletcher can reduce his demand for utility-supplied power. Since installing the panels, he's reduced his demand by 15 percent, which equates to $75 to $100 in savings per month. His efforts are good for the environment, too. By relying on solar power, Fletcher helps to lower demand on the local utility, reducing air emissions and conserving natural resources. Fletcher is pleased that his station was selected as the site of this pilot project. ""It's exciting to be at the cutting edge of something that might be commonplace in the future,"" said Fletcher. ""Solar power enhances the station. It's a great use of the canopy space, which otherwise would be empty. And, if Y2K had turned out to be something more than what it was, it was nice to know that we had an alternative way to generate electricity."" BP-Amoco is excited about the project, too. Dan Larson of BPAmoco's Community and Public Affairs Department in Towson, said solar electricity helps the company meet its goals, some of which are to:  Reduce global emissions;  Reduce emissions from all BPAmoco operations ten percent by 2010  What is biomass? Organic materials, such as sunflowers, corn, trees and grass, can also be used to produce electricity. These natural materials, called biomass, are burned in their natural state or converted into fuels that are burned to produce electricity. The natural materials used for biomass energy can be raised as energy crops, dedicated for that purpose, or can come from agricultural, forestry and natural municipal waste like paper, food and yard scraps. Even burning  COME TO THE GUNPOWDER WATERSHED FESTIVAL --ON EARTH DAY, APRIL 22nd AT OREGON RIDGE PARK 11am-5pm TO CELEBRATE THE WATERSHED AND LEARN OF EFFORTS TO PROTECT IT.

GX260-92-8945387	STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD RESOLUTION NO. 97ADOPTION OF FINDINGS AND THE MITIGATION MONITORING PLAN REQUIRED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)FOR APPROVAL OF THE REMEDIATION PLAN UNDER WATER CODE SECTION 13397 ET SEQ., FOR THE PENN MINE SITE LONG-TERM SOLUTION PROJECT WHEREAS: 1. On October 6, 1995, a Notice of Preparation of an Environmental Impact Report for the Penn Mine Site Long Term Solution Project (Project) was prepared and later circulated by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB) and East Bay Municipal Utilities District (EBMUD) as co-lead agencies in accordance with CEQA and applicable laws and regulations; and 2. Volume I of a Draft Environmental Impact Report (Draft EIR) for the Project (Volume I), which identified seven alternative projects, and Volume II of the Draft EIR, which identified Alternative 5A as the preferred project, were completed by the CVRWQCB and EBMUD; and 3. A Final Environmental Impact Report on the Project (Final EIR) that includes Volume I and II of the Draft EIR, as well as the Comment Response Document (CRD) containing responses to all comments upon the Draft EIR received by the CVRWQCB and EBMUD during the public comment period, and a Mitigation Monitoring Plan (MMP), were prepared by the CVRWQCB and EBMUD; and 4. At a public meeting of the CVRWQCB on February 28, 1997 in Sacramento, California, the CVRWQCB certified the Final EIR, adopted the findings and the MMP required by CEQA, and approved the Project after providing opportunity for comments from interested parties upon the Project and Final EIR; and 5. At a public meeting of the EBMUD Board of Directors on February 25, 1997 in Oakland, California, the EBMUD Board certified the Final EIR, adopted the findings and the MMP required by CEQA, and approved the Project after providing opportunity for comments from interested parties upon the Project and Final EIR; and 6. On May 16, 1997, the CVRWQCB the State Water Resources Control plan for the Penn Mine Long-Term Plan) and requested the SWRCB to Section 13397 et seq.; and and EBMUD jointly Board (SWRCB) a Solution Project approve it under submitted to remediation (Remediation Water Code   7. CEQA requires a responsible agency to make certain findings regarding that portion of the Project being approved by the responsible agency. The responsible agency must mitigate or avoid any significant environmental effect that is within its powers and that is caused by the portion of the Project that it approves. The SWRCB is a responsible agency for approval of the Remediation Plan. The SWRCB's powers are limited to protection of water quality, including regulation of waste disposal to land and surface water and protection of beneficial uses of water. The SWRCB also has jurisdiction to regulate water rights, but no significant environmental effects relating to water rights are identified in the Final EIR. Therefore, this resolution includes findings of mitigation of significant environmental effects regarding landfill stability, water quality, and impacts of water quality on biological resources. THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT: The SWRCB: 1. Finds the Project will provide long-term water quality protection from the effects of acid rock drainage (ARD) derived from the abandoned Penn Mine site located in the Sierra foothills near the inlet to Camanche Reservoir on the Mokelumne River. The ARD historically has been collected on site by several surface impoundments located in Hinkley Run and Mine Run Creeks. During high precipitation events and during periods of sustained precipitation and low evaporation, the capacity of the ponds has been exceeded, and pond solutions have been discharged from the mine site to the Mokelumne River or to Camanche Reservoir. The Project achieves source control through the excavation and removal of 300,000 to 332,000 cubic yards of waste materials that will be disposed of in an on-site landfill. All impoundments, including Mine Run Dam will be removed to allow the restored Hinkley Run and Mine Run Creeks to flow to Camanche Reservoir in their natural channels. A soil cover will be placed over areas of remediation for comprehensive habitat and vegetation restoration at the site. 2. Adopts an SWRCB Mitigation Monitoring Plan (SWRCB MMP) attached to this resolution as Exhibit A and imposes the SWRCB MMP as a provision of the Remediation Plan. These monitoring measures are imposed as conditions for approval of the Remediation Plan. 3. Finds with respect to impacts determined in the Final EIR to be that can be reduced to a less than imposition of mitigation measures a. Geology, Seismicity and Soils of Alternative 5A, which were potentially significant impacts significant level by within the powers of the SWRCB:   Impact: failure landfill Run Dam  As discussed in Volume I at pages 8-14 to 8-15, slope and seismic ground shaking could damage the on-site for the disposal of the mine waste material and the Mine before it is dismantled .  Findings: The following mitigation measures as discussed at pages 8-15 to 8-17 of the Final EIR are hereby imposed as a provision of the Remediation Plan and will be monitored in compliance with the SWRCB MMP. In order to mitigate the potential slope failure of the on-site landfill due to excessive erosion, landsliding, or earthquake ground shaking, the on-site landfill shall be designed to meet or exceed the requirements of the California Code of Regulations, Title 23, Chapter 15, for Group A mining wastes. Geological investigations will be conducted, and the slopes will be designed to withstand the appropriate design level earthquake. These mitigation measures will reduce geological, seismic, and soil impacts to a level of insignificance. b. Water Quality  Impact: As discussed in Volume I at pages 8-25 to 8-26, drainage with metal concentrations may be associated with Alternative 5A for a limited period after construction. Elevated levels of metals and other constituents, such as sulfates, are most likely during the first few years after waste removal, because fresh water flowing through the restored site will dissolve and flush residual salts that have been deposited in shallow bedrock and soil through leaching of the waste material over the last 150 years. Given the three-year construction schedule, it is expected that a significant portion of the flushing will occur during the wet season between the second and third years of construction after waste has been removed, but before Mine Run Dam is removed. During this period, before being dismantled, the existing In-Line System (ILS) will continue to operate as necessary to treat runoff in Mine Run Dam Reservoir (MRDR) so that significant discharges of metals will not occur. During later years (after dam removal), it is expected that the large volumes of high quality water flowing through the site from the Mine Run Creek and particularly Hinkley Run Creek drainages will result in metal concentrations in surface water that are comparable to or less than concentrations in other ephemeral streams in the region. Concentrations will decline as additional rainfall accumulates and as successive rainfall events occur. Findings: pages 8-29 15 and 19 provision The following mitigation measures, as discussed at to 8-30 of Volume I, page 43 of Volume II, and pages of the CRD of the Final EIR, are hereby imposed as a of the Remediation Plan and will be monitored in   compliance with the SWRCB MMP. There will be regular monitoring of water quality in Camanche Reservoir near the site of Mine Run Dam during construction of Alternative 5A and for not less than three years following implementation. During construction, active waste treatment will continue with the existing ILS in conjunction with surface water diversion and control in impoundments (potentially utilizing evaporation); and the physical hydraulic flushing of the remediated areas utilizing water hoses, or other equivalent means, during construction year two after the site has been cleaned of all bulk waste materials. The water generated by the flushing will be collected behind Mine Run Dam, treated, and released to Camanche Reservoir. The final design of the Shaft No. 4 plug will consider the need for grouting in the area of the shaft opening. Ground water extraction below MRDR will be considered if monitoring during construction indicates that ground water presents a risk to receiving water. After construction, if necessary to meet best management practices or other standards, a passive anoxic, limestone, or other comparable method will be used. These mitigation measures will reduce any water quality impacts to a level of insignificance. c. Biology  Impact: As discussed in Volume I at pages 8-54 to 8-55, releases of metals and other constituents to Camanche Reservoir could impact the fish or other aquatic biologic communities. This impact is potentially significant, but can be mitigated. Alternative 5A will moderately increase the discharge of copper and zinc in both ground water and surface water, but should be less than pre-Mine Run Dam conditions. Removal of surface impoundments and wastes in Hinkley Run and Mine Run Creeks will result in significantly lower releases of metals within the Creeks, and may have a beneficial impact on biological resources in the Creeks. Although Alternative 5A will result in moderately higher concentrations and loadings of metals to Camanche Reservoir than existing with Mine Run Dam in place, these incremental increases may not pose a substantial risk because, in terms of load reduction from historical levels, there is very little absolute difference between Alternative 5A and Alternative 1 (the existing condition as shown in Tables 4-22 and 4-23 on pages 4-112 and 4-113 of Volume I of the Final EIR). Based on physical and chemical water quality mitigation measures approved herein, including monitoring, it is not anticipated that fish in Camanche Reservoir with elevated tissue levels of metals will be identified. Findings: The following mitigation measures as discussed at pages 8-29 to 8-30 and 8-57 of Volume I are hereby imposed as provisions of the Remediation Plan and will be monitored in   compliance with the SWRCB MMP. Temporary measures such as the operation of treatment systems during construction will be taken. Treatment during construction will avoid or minimize the potential impact of metal discharges (see findings under b. Water Quality, above). Since it is anticipated that impacts to fish in Camanche Reservoir will be avoided as a result of the physical and chemical water quality mitigation measures being implemented, including monitoring, bioassays will not be required. These mitigation measures will reduce any health impacts to fish or humans to a level of insignificance. 4. The SWRCB anticipates that all of the significant impacts within the SWRCB's jurisdiction that are associated with implementation of Alternative 5A will be mitigated to a level of insignificance. However, to the extent that implementation of Alternative 5A results in unavoidable impacts, the SWRCB adopts and makes the following Statement of Overriding Considerations regarding the potentially unavoidable impacts of Alternative 5A. The SWRCB finds that any potentially unavoidable impact is overridden by and acceptable in light of the following benefits of adopting and implementing Alternative 5A. The SWRCB also finds that each matter set forth below is, independently of the other matters, an overriding consideration warranting approval of Alternative 5A notwithstanding any potentially unavoidable impacts. a. Alternative 5A will essentially eliminate the generation of ARD from the Penn Mine site. This is a substantial beneficial impact of the Project. b. Alternative 5A will remove surface impoundments and mine waste from Hinkley Run and Mine Run Creeks and restore their flow through their natural channels. This will greatly improve water quality in these creeks. Any increased metal loading in Camanche Reservoir and the Mokelumne River is likely to be temporary and probably will be mitigated during Project implementation to an insignificant level. If it cannot be mitigated to insignificance, there will be very little absolute difference in metal loadings between Project Alternative 5A and the no action alternative. After implementation of Alternative 5A, long-term water quality in the Creeks, Camanche Reservoir, and the Mokelumne River will be substantially better than the conditions before Mine Run Dam Reservoir was installed. This is a substantial beneficial impact of the Project. c. Alternative 5A includes substantial restoration of the physical and biological environment at the site. This is a   substantial long-term benefit in comparison to any short-term environmental impact. 5.

If no change in metal concentration is detected, further mitigation is not required. If an increase in metals is detected, monitoring shall continue to identify sources of contaminants, and additional mitigation measures shall be considered.  A detailed monitoring plan will be submitted to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) for review and approval pursuant to a revised 309 Order. The monitoring plan will specify surface and ground water sampling locations, sampling stations in receiving waters, parameters to be analyzed, and the frequency of sampling. The plan was described generally in the Environmental Impact Report (EIR), and in the Comment Response Document (CRD). During construction, the existing treatment plant will continue to operate, and sampling of discharges and receiving waters will continue in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. EPA 309 Order, which requires monthly monitoring reports. Following construction, EBMUD and the CVRWQCB will monitor runoff from the site to assess the effectiveness of the alternative. If monitoring identifies previously unrecognized sources of contaminates, additional measures, such as temporary passive systems utilizing chemical neutralizers (e.g., limestone or organic soils) may be installed.  As required by the plan, EBMUD and CVRWQCB staff, or their designees, will perform sampling, and submit periodic reports to U.S. EPA and other appropriate agencies, such as the SWRCB.

Approximately 80 feet of Felix Dam was washed out by floodwaters during Hurricane    Floyd. Water is now forced to the sides, causing erosion to the banks and threatening    a popular hiking trail in Muhlenberg Townhip.   ""The timing for removal of this dam is crucial,"" Conway said. ""Now    that the dam is exposed, it’s easily accessible to the public. Because of the    damaged timbers, we are very concerned about public safety.""   Contractors can submit bids until 1 p.m., Dec. 27, by fax only to DEP’s Bureau    of Waterways Engineering at (717) 772-0409.    The project includes removing the accumulated sediments impounded upstream    of the dam; removing of Felix Dam; removing the older dam; placing salvaged    rockfill in the eroded bank area on the east end of the older dam; seeding disturbed    areas, and cleaning the work area of equipment, demolition debris and project    materials.   The sediments will be disposed of in a state-owned impounding basin that is    part of the Schuylkill River Project, a program created to clean up pollution    caused by coal mining and processing operations upstream on the Schuylkill River.    All material will be disposed of off-site. The contractor can salvage as much    timber and steel as possible.    ""Submergence in water for all these years actually preserves the wood,""    Conway said. ""The minerals in the water also can enhance the wood color    and grain which gives value to the timber for use in wood flooring, furniture    making, etc.""   Felix Dam, a timber crib structure filled with rock, was originally constructed    for the Schuylkill Canal Navigation System. It replaced the original dam built    in the early 1800s. The state acquired it as part of the Schuylkill River Project.     The dam was constructed from white and pitch pine. Growth rings indicate that    some of the timbers were hewn from trees that were over 150 years old at the    time of construction, making them over 300 years old. These timbers may have    substantial value since this wood is no longer available.    Interested contractors can attend a pre-bid conference at 10 a.m., Dec. 20    at the dam to familiarize themselves with the project and the bid/specification    package. For more information on the bid package or the pre-bid conference,    contact Foster Schaffer, DEP Project Engineer, at (717) 783-7950.

GX150-70-9367230	Cascades  Diversion Dam Removal Project                       Yosemite   National Park      Lead Agency:  National Park Service      Finding of No Significant Impact      Purpose and Need      This Finding of No Significant Impact documents the  decision of the National Park Service (NPS) to adopt a plan to remove Cascades  Diversion Dam and the determination that no significant impacts on the human  environment are associated with that decision. The purpose of the Cascades  Diversion Dam Removal Project is to remove an unnatural obstruction on the  Merced   River  and to restore the river’s natural free-flowing condition.  This removal project is consistent with the Wild and  Scenic     River  guidance provided in the  Merced  Wild and Scenic River Comprehensive Management Plan  (Merced River Plan)  and will meet the direction of the  Yosemite  Valley Plan , which calls for the dam removal of the dam.       Cascades Diversion Dam is classified as a high-hazard  structure. It is in unsatisfactory condition due to flood damage sustained in  1997 and to continuing deterioration associated with age. In addition, the dam  no longer serves a useful purpose – water is not diverted from the site to  generate electricity or for other uses, and the impoundment does not regulate  high water. Removal of the existing dam structure is necessary to prevent  possible uncontrolled and sudden failure, which could result in a release of  impounded water and the deposition of concrete and timber debris, grouted  rockfill, and impounded sediment along the downstream channel. Such an  occurrence could pose a considerable threat to valued resources (such as  aquatic life, scenic vistas, and recreational opportunities), infrastructure ( El    Portal Road , wastewater, telephone, and electrical  lines), and human life. In addition, the National Park Service is entrusted with  conserving and restoring park values. This responsibility includes  protecting the biological and physical processes that created the park, along  with scenic features, natural landscapes, and native plants and wildlife. The  removal of the dam would work toward fulfilling this mandate by restoring this  segment of the  Merced River . A complete description of  the proposal and its environmental consequences are contained in the Cascades  Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment.       Alternatives Analyzed      The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental  Assessment analyzed three alternatives, Alternative 1: No Action, Alternative  2: Complete Dam Removal, and Alternative 3: Partial Dam Removal. The National  Park Service developed these alternatives based on the proposed action’s  purpose and need, issues raised during scoping, and other public comment. The  Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment disclosed the  potential environmental consequences that may result from implementation of  each alternative. Comments received during public review of the Cascades  Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment were considered in  preparation of this Finding of No Significant Impact and are summarized in the  Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Summary of Public Comments and Responses  (NPS 2003).      Alternative 1: No Action Alternative      The No Action Alternative maintains the status quo at  Cascades Diversion Dam, as described in Chapter III, Affected Environment. It  provides a baseline from which to compare the action alternatives, to evaluate  the magnitude of proposed changes, and to measure the environmental effects of  those changes.       Under the No Action Alternative, Cascades Diversion Dam  would continue to degrade and would eventually fail. Dam failure would likely  occur during high-flow conditions, releasing large debris and sediments to the  river and banks. In addition, continued deterioration of the dam over time  would result in the release of large debris. Dam debris could damage downstream  natural, cultural, and scenic resources as well as recreation opportunities and  park facilities. Dam debris could also result in serious injury and/or fatality  to recreational users of the river. There are voids under the existing timber crib  sheathing and many boards are on the verge of collapse that create a potential  safety hazard for people walking on the     wooden crest of the dam. The National Park Service would remove dam  debris from the river as soon as possible following release, although debris  retrieval would not likely commence until low-flow conditions, which could be  several months after dam failure or debris release. Diverted riverflows and  erosion could result in adverse impacts to vegetation, soils, and cultural  resources along the riverbanks. Over the long term, uncontrolled dam failure  would restore free flow of the  Merced River  at this  location.      Alternative 2: Complete Dam Removal      Alternative 2 includes complete removal of the dam, the  dam abutments, the intake structure, and the screenhouse, and restoration of  the related river channel located beneath the dam site. Approximately 4,400 to  5,400 cubic yards of sediments (including rock and boulders) in the area  upstream of the dam would be excavated and repositioned to stabilize the  river-right bank and decrease the potential for sediment erosion. Natural river  processes would continue to transport remaining sediments (up to a maximum  range of approximately 9,600 to 15,600 cubic yards of sediment) from the  impoundment area over time, allowing for a gradual re‑establishment of  the natural river channel and related riparian habitat. It is expected that the  river would fully recover over time, as sediments are transported from the  impoundment area. However, the rate of natural channel recovery and restoration  would be monitored to determine if additional restoration actions were  necessary. Following removal of the river-right abutment, intake structure, and  screenhouse, the river-right bank would be stabilized using a  bioengineered bank stabilization system   (brush layering incorporated into a boulder structure) to prevent erosion. The  objective of this alternative would be to restore the natural river character  with a mixture and distribution of boulders, cobbles, gravels, sand, silt,  soil, and vegetation similar to those found in adjacent riverbank segments.      Alternative 3: Partial Dam Removal      Alternative 3 includes complete removal of the dam, the  river-left dam abutment, and the screenhouse on the river-right intake  structure, and restoration of the related river channel located beneath the dam  site. Under this alternative the river-right dam abutment and intake structure  would be retained for use as a river viewing platform. Approximately 4,400 to  5,400 cubic yards of sediments (including rocks and boulders) in the area  upstream of the dam would be excavated and repositioned to stabilize the  river-right bank and decrease the potential for sediment erosion. Natural river  processes would continue to transport remaining sediments (up to a maximum  range of approximately 9,600 to 15,600 cubic yards of sediment) from the  impoundment area over time, allowing for a gradual re-establishment of the  natural river channel and related riparian habitat. It is expected that the  river would fully recover incrementally over time, as sediments are transported  from the impoundment area. However, the rate of natural channel recovery and  restoration would be monitored to determine if additional restoration actions  were necessary. Following removal of the dam and screenhouse, the river-right  bank would be stabilized upstream and downstream of the intake structure using  a bioengineered bank stabilization system to prevent erosion of the river-right  bank. The objective of this alternative would be to restore the natural river  character with a mixture and distribution of boulders, cobbles, gravels, sand,  silt, soil, and vegetation similar to those found in adjacent riverbank  segments.       Alternatives Considered but Dismissed      The National Park  Service considered five additional alternatives to the proposed action that  were dismissed from further consideration because they did not meet the  project's purpose and need. These included:      §            Remove Cascades Diversion Dam  and Complete Sediment Removal.    Removal of the Cascades Diversion Dam in conjunction with complete removal  of the 15,000 to 20,000 cubic yards of sediment in the upstream impoundment  would remove sediments that were present prior to construction of the dam in  1917. Removal of sediment present prior to dam construction would not result in  the re-establishment of a near-natural river channel and related riparian  habitat. In addition, this alternative would require 700 to 750 truck trips to  remove dam materials and sediment and would entail a project duration of seven  months. This would result in greater impacts to air quality, traffic and  access, and recreation-related experience than the action alternatives  considered in this environmental assessment.      §            Restore Cascades Diversion  Dam and Hydroelectric Generating Facility.  Repair of Cascades  Diversion Dam and the entire hydroelectric generating facility to fully  functioning capacity would require complete removal and reconstruction of the  dam overflow structure, reconstruction of approximately one mile of penstock,  which would need to be installed under El Portal Road (Highway 140),  reconstruction of the tailrace (or outlet channel), and purchase and  installation of new generating equipment in the powerhouse. Although this  alternative would alleviate the high-hazard condition of the dam, consistent  with the project’s Need, it is inconsistent with the Purpose of the project to  remove an unnatural obstruction on the Merced River and to restore the river’s  free-flowing condition, consistent with the Merced River Plan (NPS 2001a) and  Yosemite Valley Plan (NPS 2000a).      §            Replace Cascades Diversion  Dam with Boulders.   This  option would require complete removal of the dam overflow structure and  installation of large boulders at the current dam site to impound water and  limit downstream sediment transport. This option would perpetuate unnatural  conditions at the site, limiting free flow of the  Merced River   and other natural processes. Similar to the above scenario, this option is  inconsistent with the Purpose of the project.      §            Remove Portions of the Dam  Over Time.   This option  would remove the dam overflow structure, abutments, and the intake structure in  phases over a series of years, ultimately resulting in complete removal of all  structures and impounded sediments. Phased removal of the dam over a period of  years would expand removal-related impacts. For example, transportation- and  recreation-related effects of removal would last years instead of one season.  Removing only a portion of the dam’s overflow structure in the first season could  destabilize remaining structures and could result in uncontrolled failure.  Uncontrolled failure of the remaining structures would have downstream impacts  on resources and free flow of the  Merced River  and has  potential to adversely affect park facilities, recreational uses, and visitors,  similar to the No Action Alternative. Therefore, this alternative would not be  consistent with the Need for this project.       §            Combine the Removal of  Cascades Diversion Dam with the Final Phase of the El Portal Road Improvement  Project.  The National Park Service intends to remove Cascades  Diversion Dam, let natural processes prevail through this reach of the  Merced   River , and allow the river to stabilize.    If the National Park Service decides to  proceed with the El Portal Road Improvement Project – Cascades Dam to  Pohono     Bridge , potential future designs  will need to comply with the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act as well as other  legislation and park planning documents. Although the Cascades Diversion Dam  Removal Project is completely distinct from the El Portal Road Improvement  Project, the road improvement project is included in the cumulative impact  analysis in the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment  because it is a reasonably foreseeable project that the National Park Service  may decide to pursue.      Environmentally Preferable Alternative      The environmentally preferred alternative is determined by  applying criteria identified in Section 101 of the National Environmental  Policy Act to each alternative considered. In accordance with the National  Environmental Policy Act, the environmentally preferred alternative would best:  (1) fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the  environment for succeeding generations; (2) assure for all generations  safe, healthful, productive, and esthetically and culturally pleasing  surroundings; (3) attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment  without degradation, risk of health or safety, or other undesirable and  unintended consequences; (4) preserve important historic, cultural and  natural aspects of our national heritage and maintaining, wherever possible, an  environment that supports diversity and variety of individual choice;  (5) achieve a balance between population and resource use that will permit  high standards of living and a wide sharing of life’s amenities; and (6)  enhance the quality of renewable resources and approaching the maximum  attainable recycling of depletable resources.      The National Park Service has considered all alternatives  in this analysis in accordance with National Environmental Policy Act and  Council on Environmental Quality regulations (Council on Environmental Quality  Regulations, Section 1505.2) and has determined that Alternative 2: Complete  Dam Removal, as presented in the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project  Environmental Assessment is environmentally preferable. After review of  potential resource and visitor impacts, and developing mitigation for impacts  to natural and cultural resources, the preferred alternative achieves the  greatest balance between (1) providing a high level of protection of  natural and downstream cultural resources while concurrently attaining the  widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation;  (2) reducing risks to public health and safety; and (3) providing  aesthetically pleasing surroundings.      Why the Preferred Alternative Will Not Have a Significant Effect on the  Human Environment      Complete dam removal under Alternative 2 would restore the  free-flowing condition of the  Merced River  and return  this portion of the river to a more natural condition, thereby enhancing its  biologic and hydrologic integrity. Overall, there would be long-term minor to  moderate beneficial impacts on soils, public safety with respect to geologic  hazards, hydrologic processes, water quality, vegetation, fish and wildlife  habitat, scenic resources, orientation and interpretation, and park operations.  There would be negligible to minor beneficial impacts related air quality,  noise, transportation, recreation, and socio-economics. There would be adverse  short-term removal-related impacts to the above resources, which would be  reduced by the application of Best Management Practices and resource-specific  mitigation measures (see Mitigation, below).      There would be no net loss of wetland habitat as a result  of the project. As the base level of the river drops following dam removal, and  the river stabilizes, the channel of the  Merced River   would narrow in the vicinity of the dam. As the river narrows, there would be a  change in wetland habitat from riverine upper perennial wetland (currently  located in the main channel of the  Merced River ) to  palustrine forest, scrub shrub, or emergent wetlands that would line the  narrower river channel. There could be a temporary reduction in the size of  wetlands that line the  Merced River  channel, as wetland  vegetation establishes in proximity to the new river channel.        Dam removal activities would have a short-term impact to  special-status species associated with ground disturbance and the potential  introduction of pollutants. However, dam removal activities would occur in a  controlled manner, with the application of mitigation, reducing the adverse  effect to a negligible intensity. Removal of Cascades Diversion Dam and revegetation  would restore the free-flowing condition of the  Merced River   and return this portion of the river to a more natural state, thereby enhancing  the biological integrity of this segment for Wawona rifle beetle and harlequin  duck. The bioengineered bank stabilization and revegetation would have a  beneficial effect on habitat for special-status bats and  California   spotted owl at this location.       Ground-disturbing activities under the preferred  alternative could have a local, long-term, minor, adverse impact to as-yet  unknown archeological resources. Any actions would be performed in accordance  with stipulations in the park’s 1999 Programmatic Agreement.   Ground-disturbing activities under the  preferred alternative could also affect ethnographic resources. Any actions  would be performed in accordance with stipulations in the park’s 1999  Programmatic Agreement, such as disturbance avoidance or culturally sensitive  design measures. In addition, the park would continue to consult with  culturally associated American Indian tribes under this Programmatic Agreement  and the cooperative agreement for traditional uses. Therefore, the preferred  alternative would result in a local, short-term, negligible, adverse impact to  ethnographic resources. These impacts are not considered significant because of  their short duration and low intensity. In addition, mitigations are  incorporated into the project design.      The impact of the removal of Cascades Diversion Dam was  evaluated and disclosed in the  Yosemite Valley Plan Supplemental  Environmental Impact Statement  (Yosemite Valley Plan)(NPS 2000). This  environmental assessment is tiered to the Yosemite Valley Plan and provides  greater detail on the manner in which the dam would be removed. Controlled  removal of Cascades Diversion Dam under the preferred alternative would be  conducted in compliance with the park’s 1999 Programmatic Agreement. This would  avoid impacts to downstream cultural properties. As to the removal of the dam  itself, the Yosemite Valley Plan disclosed that the impact of removing this  cultural property is moderate and adverse. The park has already satisfied the  mitigation requirements specified for this point in the process in the 1986  Memorandum of Agreement between the park and the State Historic Preservation  Officer. The Memorandum of Agreement requires additional mitigation measures  once the dam is removed.       The Cascades Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment  also analyzed cumulative impacts of the project, and in no case were cumulative  impacts considered significant. Complete removal of Cascades Diversion Dam  would have both long-term and short-term impacts on natural, cultural, and  social resources, though none of the impacts are considered a significant  effect on the human environment as defined in the National Environmental Policy  Act. In addition, no highly uncertain or controversial impacts, unique or  unknown risks, or elements of precedence have been identified, and implementing  the preferred alternative will not violate any federal, state, or local  environmental laws.       Non-impairment of Park Resources      Pursuant to the 1916 Organic Act, the National Park  Service has a management responsibility “to conserve the scenery and the  natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the  enjoyment of future generations.” Therefore, the National Park Service cannot  take an action that would “impair” park resources or values.      Based on the analysis provided in the Cascades Diversion  Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment, the National Park Service  concludes that implementation of Alternative 2, Complete Dam Removal, would  have no major adverse impacts to a resource or value whose conservation is (1)  necessary to fulfill specific purposes identified in the establishing  legislation or proclamation of Yosemite National Park; (2) key to the natural  or cultural integrity of Yosemite National Park or to opportunities for  enjoyment of the park; or (3) identified as a goal in the park’s General  Management Plan or other relevant National Park Service planning documents.  Consequently, implementation of the proposed action will not violate the  National Park Service Organic Act.      Mitigation      The following mitigation measures (table 1-1) have been  incorporated into the project to avoid or reduce impacts to park resources.

Alternatively, if activities take place    during the breeding season, a qualified biologist shall conduct a pre-work    survey for individuals no more than two weeks prior to construction in March    through August. If any special-status species is observed nesting, a    determination shall be made as to whether or not the proposed action will    impact the active nest or disrupt reproductive behavior. If it is determined    that the action will not impact an active nest or disrupt breeding behavior,    work shall proceed without any restriction or mitigation measure. If it is    determined that dam removal activities will impact an active nest or disrupt    reproductive behavior, then avoidance strategies shall be implemented. Dam    removal activities could be delayed within 500 feet of such a nest until a    qualified biologist determines that the subject birds are not nesting or    until any juvenile birds are no longer using the nest as their primary day    and night roost.

National Park    Service Project Manager      Yosemite       National Park  Contractor                Concurrent with    project activities                                           Public Involvement and Coordination      Public Involvement      Scoping History      The National Park  Service conducted public scoping for the proposed action during Spring 2001.  The Yosemite National Park Superintendent mailed a letter announcing the  beginning of the planning process for removal of the Cascades Diversion Dam to  individuals and organizations on the park’s planning mailing list. The letter  was also posted on the park’s web site.       During the planning process, alternatives were developed  that addressed dam removal and compliance with the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act  of 1968, as amended (16  United States   Code [USC] 1274[d]). Through scoping and the public comment review process on  the  Cascades Diversion Dam  Removal  Project Environmental Assessment, the planning process is being conducted in  consultation with affected federal agencies, state and local governments,  tribal groups, and interested organizations and individuals.      On-Site Public Meeting      On  April 18, 2001 ,  the National Park Service held an informal public scoping meeting to discuss  the potential removal of Cascades Diversion Dam. The meeting included project  orientation, group discussion, and a visit to the dam site to view the existing  conditions. The purpose of the informal public scoping meeting was to: (1)  provide participants with an overview of existing conditions and the proposed  action; (2) ask participants to identify key issues that should be analyzed  during the environmental review and compliance process; and (3) provide an  opportunity for participants to ask questions regarding project alternatives  and the overall environmental review and compliance process.      Results of Scoping      Scoping comments were received through  April 27, 2001 . As a result of the  scoping effort, over 75 public scoping comments were elicited. All  comments were reviewed and analyzed to determine public concerns. In addition,  the National Park Service posts a project fact sheet and project planning  updates on the park’s web site. Project planning updates have also been  presented at ongoing open house meetings and in the park’s planning update  newsletter. Based on public scoping comments, and applicable federal law,  regulations, and executive orders, the National Park Service determined that an  environmental assessment (not an en environmental impact statement) would be  the appropriate level of compliance for the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal  Project. Public scoping comments, and issues raised by National Park Service  staff, provided input used in the alternatives development process and in the  analysis presented in this document.      Public Comment      The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental  Assessment was released for a 30-day public review period beginning  February 19, 2003  and closed  March 24, 2003 . In addition, the  National Park Service held regular Open Houses during 2003 to disseminate  information and collect informal written comments on the Cascades Dam Removal  and other projects. Comments received during the formal public comment period  consisted of 22 letters, emails, and faxes from 23 individuals with a total of  81 comments. Issues raised included NEPA compliance, alternatives, bank  stabilization, interpretation, aesthetics, and cumulative projects. None of the  comments received introduced substantive new information nor raised any issues  not fully considered in the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project  Environmental Assessment. No modifications to the proposed action were made as  a result of comments.

In December 2002, the  National Park Service requested an extension on the timeline of the permit for  dam removal activities. The extended permit would be valid only for actions  related to dam removal, and would not be valid for actions regarding possible  future  El Portal Road   improvements. In addition, the National Park Service notified the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers that the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project was a  discrete project from the future El Portal Road Improvement Project and would  not include road improvements. The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project will  not be implemented until the extended permit is in place.      Central Valley  Regional Water Quality Control Board      The National Park  Service is in the process of applying for California Regional Water Quality  Control Board Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification. The  National Park Service may be required to submit a report of waste discharge,  and obtain Waste Discharge Requirements or an individual waiver. Copies of the  existing waste discharge waiver are on file at  Yosemite   National Park . The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project will  not be initiated until the certification is place.      U.S.  Fish  and Wildlife Service      The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that the  Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project is not likely to adversely affect any  threatened or endangered species or critical habitat (U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service Letter,  March 10, 2003 ,  Reference Number 1-1-03-I-1275).      California   State   Historic Preservation Officer      Cascades Diversion Dam has been the subject of previous  evaluation and mitigation actions, as described at the beginning of this  chapter. In 1986, the National Park Service evaluated the impacts associated  with the demolition, relocation, and/or rehabilitation of all components of the  Yosemite Hydroelectric Power Plant (also known as the Cascades Powerhouse).  This evaluation included the removal of the dam. With the completion of this  evaluation, the National Park Service completed the consultation process associated  with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as  amended. As part of this process, the National Park Service signed a Memorandum  of Agreement with the California State Historic Preservation Officer and the  Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. A copy of the memorandum is located  at the end of Chapter VI of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project  Environmental Assessment. A copy of the verification letter is also on file at  Yosemite     National Park . The National Park  Service has complied with the various stipulations of the Memorandum of  Agreement and has sent a letter to the State Historic Preservation Officer  indicating that the Section 106 consultation process is complete. A letter  of concurrence was received from the California State Historic Preservation  Officer on  March 18, 2003 .  The letter requested additional details regarding compliance with stipulations  of the Memorandum of Agreement, but indicated there is no objection to any  aspect of the notification regarding the adverse effects, provided the proposed  mitigation measures are implemented (table 1-1). A copy of the verification  letter is on file at  Yosemite   National    Park .

So far a couple of                      controversial proposals for removal of hydropower generating                      dams in Maine have been the drivers for much of the debate.                      A couple of attempts at dam removal legislation were offered                      last session but were not adopted.                                           The kind of case-by-case, de facto approach to dam removal                      that Maine has used in the past has worked until now. We don’t                      want to fix what might not be broken, but at the same time,                      by initiating this discussion, SPO hopes to identify and address                      any needs for change in or creation of policy for dam removals.                      Such a policy or legislative initiative on dam removal should                      apply broadly to all dams but not limit flexibility or restrict                      creative solutions which may be applied on a case by case                      basis.                                           The purpose of SPO’s involvement in the debate arrives                      out of an impulse to facilitate the development of a constructive                      and visionary approach to dam removals in Maine. SPO should                      in no way be interpreted to be promoting dam removal. SPO                      upholds the existing hydropower law and its intent, which                      recognizes the unique attributes and contribution to the indigenous                      energy supply that hydropower provides for the people of Maine.                      We are merely posing the question, “How different is                      dam deconstruction from dam development and is it accommodated                      adequately in current law and protocol?” We realize that                      dam removals have different impacts and are dissimilar enough                      from developments that they may require specialized treatment.                      This is what motivates our interest in facilitating a constructive                      dialogue on the topic. We hope that by doing so we can avert                      reactive and narrow approaches to dam removal policy in Maine.

Public education is an essential component of this;                       A free flowing river system has intrinsic value;                        The potential for recreational, economic, environmental                        benefits resulting from dam removal should be publicly identified                        and recognized in any removal proceeding;                       The potential for habitat restoration and ecological impacts                        resulting from dam removal should be publicly identified                        and recognized; and                        Flood control benefits, fire protection and dam safety                        issues should be publicly identified and recognized in any                        removal proceeding.                                                                                      Observations with respect to Dam Removal Policy                      in Maine                                              Any changes in dam removal policy should occur only after                        a comprehensive analysis of the law and identification of                        deficiencies within current application of the law.                        There is a balance to achieve between clean air and energy                        policies in any dam removal proceeding.                        Can we calculate the effect of dam removal on climate                        change?                        How should the State’s dam removal policies reflect                        purposes of MWDCA?                        The legal processes surrounding dam removal need further                        clarification.                        FERC dams should be exempt from further State regulation.                                             The same permit process should be employed for dam removal                        as in a hydro construction or development.                        It is essential to scientifically analyze the possible                        impacts before attempting a dam removal and it is necessary                        to follow-up with scientific analysis after a dam removal                        in order to fully comprehend the outcome of a removal and                        it’s impacts on the entire ecosystem.                        There is a need to analyze the dynamics of FERC protocol                        in juxtaposition to local interests in any dam removal proceeding.                                             There is a need to analyze the costs of removal. Who is                        accountable and under what conditions?                        It is essential to study both environmental and socio-economic                        impacts of a removal.                        The primary and secondary purposes of a dam should be                        fully explored and understood in any removal proceeding.

As a result, water levels in the river have changed between Augusta and Waterville/Winslow. Along much of this stretch of river the normal high-water line will likely also change significantly. This shift in the normal high-water line will have a direct affect on adjacent land use activities as they relate to two specific state environmental laws.      Shoreland Zoning   The state Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Act (38 MRSA sections 435-449) requires all municipalities to adopt ordinances regulating land-use activities adjacent to certain bodies of water. The relevant consideration here is that the ordinances must apply to areas within 250 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of rivers such as the Kennebec.    These municipal shoreland zoning ordinances establish land use standards for numerous activities that occur within the ""shoreland zone."" For instance, they generally require a 75-foot vegetative strip (buffer area) between land uses and the normal high-water line of the river. Within this buffer, no new cleared openings are permitted. Tree removal is limited to no more than 40% of the volume of trees in any ten-year period, and a well-distributed stand of trees must remain. Furthermore, new structural development must occur beyond the 75-foot buffer area.    The lowering of the Kennebec will have a direct impact on the above issues. For example, if the new normal high-water line has receded by 75 feet at a certain location, this 75-foot area will become the new setback/buffer zone, although it may presently be devoid of vegetation. The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has discussed this matter with appropriate municipal officials so that proper water setbacks will be maintained and adequate vegetative buffers will be reestablished consistent with the purposes of the shoreland zoning law.    We can be s certain that the normal high-water line will change between Augusta and the Waterville/Winslow area, but the new line can not be determined until several years of highwater levels occur during the spring runoff. (Physical features used to establish the normal high-water line include visual markings on the shoreline, changes in the character of the soils due to prolonged action of the water, and the presence of wetland vegetation. )     Until a new normal high-water line is clearly established by river flows, DEP has recommended that code enforcement officers in the affected municipalities consider the normal high-water line to be the same as that before the breaching occurred.      Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA)   The Natural Resources Protection Act (38 MRSA sections 480-A thru 480-Z), a state law administered and enforced by DEP, requires a permit from the Department before:             Placing fill or disturbing/bulldozing soil within 100 feet of the normal high-water line       of the river;       Filling, dredging, or removing vegetation below the normal high-water line; or       Constructing, repairing, or altering any permanent structure located in, on, or over the       river.          As with the shoreland zoning law, the changes in water levels resulting from the dam’s breaching will directly affect those areas subject to the Natural Resources Protection Act. For soil disturbance activities in most locations, the area subject to the NRPA will shift toward the center of the river. Again, however, the new normal high-water line of the river can not be determined immediately. Until such time as that new line is established by river flow, landowners should consider the old line as the normal high-water line of the river.    For certain, though, the newly exposed land along the river will be subject to the NRPA. A landowner who is contemplating any of the above listed activities, including: construction of water-access areas; removal of rocks and boulders; placement of fill; or construction of permanent structures such as docks, is advised to contact the Department’s Division of Land Resource Regulation at 287-2111 for further guidance on permit requirements. Such activities may also be subject to local permitting through the town’s code enforcement officer or planning board.      Additional Considerations   Finally, structural development and filling activities within the floodplain of the river are subject to the local Floodplain Management Ordinance that is administered by the respective municipality. Landowners must be aware of the requirements of the ordinance and obtain any necessary permits pursuant to that ordinance as well."
GX026-97-2645135	May 23, 1997 DRAFT      STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD       RESOLUTION NO. 97-      ADOPTION OF FINDINGS AND THE      MITIGATION MONITORING PLAN REQUIRED BY THE       CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)       FOR APPROVAL OF THE REMEDIATION PLAN UNDER       WATER CODE SECTION 13397 ET SEQ., FOR THE       PENN MINE SITE LONG-TERM SOLUTION PROJECT             WHEREAS:      1. On October 6, 1995, a Notice of Preparation of an  Environmental Impact Report for the Penn Mine Site Long Term  Solution Project (Project) was prepared and later circulated by  the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB)  and East Bay Municipal Utilities District (EBMUD) as co-lead  agencies in accordance with CEQA and applicable laws and  regulations; and      2. Volume I of a Draft Environmental Impact Report (Draft EIR)  for the Project (Volume I), which identified seven alternative  projects, and Volume II of the Draft EIR, which identified  Alternative 5A as the preferred project, were completed by the  CVRWQCB and EBMUD; and       3. A Final Environmental Impact Report on the Project (Final  EIR) that includes Volume I and II of the Draft EIR, as well as  the Comment Response Document (CRD) containing responses to all  comments upon the Draft EIR received by the CVRWQCB and EBMUD  during the public comment period, and a Mitigation Monitoring  Plan (MMP), were prepared by the CVRWQCB and EBMUD; and      4. At a public meeting of the CVRWQCB on February 28, 1997 in  Sacramento, California, the CVRWQCB certified the Final EIR,  adopted the findings and the MMP required by CEQA, and approved  the Project after providing opportunity for comments from  interested parties upon the Project and Final EIR; and      5. At a public meeting of the EBMUD Board of Directors on  February 25, 1997 in Oakland, California, the EBMUD Board  certified the Final EIR, adopted the findings and the MMP  required by CEQA, and approved the Project after providing  opportunity for comments from interested parties upon the Project  and Final EIR; and      6. On May 16, 1997, the CVRWQCB and EBMUD jointly submitted to  the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) a remediation  plan for the Penn Mine Long-Term Solution Project (Remediation  Plan) and requested the SWRCB to approve it under Water Code  Section 13397 et seq.; and      7. CEQA requires a responsible agency to make certain findings  regarding that portion of the Project being approved by the  responsible agency. The responsible agency must mitigate or avoid  any significant environmental effect that is within its powers  and that is caused by the portion of the Project that it  approves. The SWRCB is a responsible agency for approval of the  Remediation Plan. The SWRCB's powers are limited to protection of  water quality, including regulation of waste disposal to land and  surface water and protection of beneficial uses of water. The  SWRCB also has jurisdiction to regulate water rights, but no  significant environmental effects relating to water rights are  identified in the Final EIR. Therefore, this resolution includes  findings of mitigation of significant environmental effects  regarding landfill stability, water quality, and impacts of water  quality on biological resources.      THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT:      The SWRCB:      1. Finds the Project will provide long-term water quality  protection from the effects of acid rock drainage (ARD) derived  from the abandoned Penn Mine site located in the Sierra foothills  near the inlet to Camanche Reservoir on the Mokelumne River. The  ARD historically has been collected on site by several surface  impoundments located in Hinkley Run and Mine Run Creeks. During  high precipitation events and during periods of sustained  precipitation and low evaporation, the capacity of the ponds has  been exceeded, and pond solutions have been discharged from the  mine site to the Mokelumne River or to Camanche Reservoir. The  Project achieves source control through the excavation and  removal of 300,000 to 332,000 cubic yards of waste materials that  will be disposed of in an on-site landfill. All impoundments,  including Mine Run Dam will be removed to allow the restored  Hinkley Run and Mine Run Creeks to flow to Camanche Reservoir in  their natural channels. A soil cover will be placed over areas of  remediation for comprehensive habitat and vegetation restoration  at the site.      2. Adopts an SWRCB Mitigation Monitoring Plan (SWRCB MMP)  attached to this resolution as Exhibit A and imposes the SWRCB  MMP as a provision of the Remediation Plan. These monitoring  measures are imposed as conditions for approval of the  Remediation Plan.       3. Finds with respect to impacts of Alternative 5A, which were  determined in the Final EIR to be potentially significant impacts  that can be reduced to a less than significant level by  imposition of mitigation measures within the powers of the SWRCB:      a. Geology, Seismicity and Soils      Impact: As discussed in Volume I at pages 8-14 to 8-15, slope  failure and seismic ground shaking could damage the on-site  landfill for the disposal of the mine waste material and the Mine  Run Dam before it is dismantled .      Findings: The following mitigation measures as discussed at  pages 8-15 to 8-17 of the Final EIR are hereby imposed as a  provision of the Remediation Plan and will be monitored in  compliance with the SWRCB MMP. In order to mitigate the potential  slope failure of the on-site landfill due to excessive erosion,  landsliding, or earthquake ground shaking, the on-site landfill  shall be designed to meet or exceed the requirements of the  California Code of Regulations, Title 23, Chapter 15, for Group A  mining wastes. Geological investigations will be conducted, and  the slopes will be designed to withstand the appropriate design  level earthquake. These mitigation measures will reduce  geological, seismic, and soil impacts to a level of  insignificance.      b. Water Quality      Impact: As discussed in Volume I at pages 8-25 to 8-26,  drainage with metal concentrations may be associated with  Alternative 5A for a limited period after construction. Elevated  levels of metals and other constituents, such as sulfates, are  most likely during the first few years after waste removal,  because fresh water flowing through the restored site will  dissolve and flush residual salts that have been deposited in  shallow bedrock and soil through leaching of the waste material  over the last 150 years. Given the three-year construction  schedule, it is expected that a significant portion of the  flushing will occur during the wet season between the second and  third years of construction after waste has been removed, but  before Mine Run Dam is removed. During this period, before being  dismantled, the existing In-Line System (ILS) will continue to  operate as necessary to treat runoff in Mine Run Dam Reservoir  (MRDR) so that significant discharges of metals will not occur.  During later years (after dam removal), it is expected that the  large volumes of high quality water flowing through the site from  the Mine Run Creek and particularly Hinkley Run Creek drainages  will result in metal concentrations in surface water that are  comparable to or less than concentrations in other ephemeral  streams in the region. Concentrations will decline as additional  rainfall accumulates and as successive rainfall events occur.       Findings: The following mitigation measures, as discussed at  pages 8-29 to 8-30 of Volume I, page 43 of Volume II, and pages  15 and 19 of the CRD of the Final EIR, are hereby imposed as a  provision of the Remediation Plan and will be monitored in  compliance with the SWRCB MMP. There will be regular monitoring  of water quality in Camanche Reservoir near the site of Mine Run  Dam during construction of Alternative 5A and for not less than  three years following implementation. During construction, active  waste treatment will continue with the existing ILS in  conjunction with surface water diversion and control in  impoundments (potentially utilizing evaporation); and the  physical hydraulic flushing of the remediated areas utilizing  water hoses, or other equivalent means, during construction year  two after the site has been cleaned of all bulk waste materials.  The water generated by the flushing will be collected behind Mine  Run Dam, treated, and released to Camanche Reservoir. The final  design of the Shaft No. 4 plug will consider the need for  grouting in the area of the shaft opening. Ground water  extraction below MRDR will be considered if monitoring during  construction indicates that ground water presents a risk to  receiving water. After construction, if necessary to meet best  management practices or other standards, a passive anoxic,  limestone, or other comparable method will be used. These  mitigation measures will reduce any water quality impacts to a  level of insignificance.      c. Biology      Impact: As discussed in Volume I at pages 8-54 to 8-55,  releases of metals and other constituents to Camanche Reservoir  could impact the fish or other aquatic biologic communities. This  impact is potentially significant, but can be mitigated.  Alternative 5A will moderately increase the discharge of copper  and zinc in both ground water and surface water, but should be  less than pre-Mine Run Dam conditions. Removal of surface  impoundments and wastes in Hinkley Run and Mine Run Creeks will  result in significantly lower releases of metals within the  Creeks, and may have a beneficial impact on biological resources  in the Creeks. Although Alternative 5A will result in moderately  higher concentrations and loadings of metals to Camanche  Reservoir than existing with Mine Run Dam in place, these  incremental increases may not pose a substantial risk because, in  terms of load reduction from historical levels, there is very  little absolute difference between Alternative 5A and  Alternative 1 (the existing condition as shown in Tables  4-22 and 4-23 on pages 4-112 and 4-113 of Volume I of the Final  EIR). Based on physical and chemical water quality mitigation  measures approved herein, including monitoring, it is not  anticipated that fish in Camanche Reservoir with elevated tissue  levels of metals will be identified.      Findings: The following mitigation measures as discussed at  pages 8-29 to 8-30 and 8-57 of Volume I are hereby imposed as  provisions of the Remediation Plan and will be monitored in  compliance with the SWRCB MMP. Temporary measures such as the  operation of treatment systems during construction will be taken.  Treatment during construction will avoid or minimize the  potential impact of metal discharges (see findings under b. Water  Quality, above). Since it is anticipated that impacts to fish in  Camanche Reservoir will be avoided as a result of the physical  and chemical water quality mitigation measures being implemented,  including monitoring, bioassays will not be required. These  mitigation measures will reduce any health impacts to fish or  humans to a level of insignificance.      4. The SWRCB anticipates that all of the significant impacts  within the SWRCB's jurisdiction that are associated with  implementation of Alternative 5A will be mitigated to a level of  insignificance. However, to the extent that implementation of  Alternative 5A results in unavoidable impacts, the SWRCB adopts  and makes the following Statement of Overriding Considerations  regarding the potentially unavoidable impacts of Alternative 5A.  The SWRCB finds that any potentially unavoidable impact is  overridden by and acceptable in light of the following benefits  of adopting and implementing Alternative 5A.       The SWRCB also finds that each matter set forth below is,  independently of the other matters, an overriding consideration  warranting approval of Alternative 5A notwithstanding any  potentially unavoidable impacts.      a. Alternative 5A will essentially eliminate the generation of  ARD from the Penn Mine site. This is a substantial beneficial  impact of the Project.      b. Alternative 5A will remove surface impoundments and mine  waste from Hinkley Run and Mine Run Creeks and restore their flow  through their natural channels. This will greatly improve water  quality in these creeks. Any increased metal loading in Camanche  Reservoir and the Mokelumne River is likely to be temporary and  probably will be mitigated during Project implementation to an  insignificant level. If it cannot be mitigated to insignificance,  there will be very little absolute difference in metal loadings  between Project Alternative 5A and the no action alternative.       After implementation of Alternative 5A, long-term water  quality in the Creeks, Camanche Reservoir, and the Mokelumne  River will be substantially better than the conditions before  Mine Run Dam Reservoir was installed. This is a substantial  beneficial impact of the Project.      c. Alternative 5A includes substantial restoration of the  physical and biological environment at the site. This is a  substantial long-term benefit in comparison to any short-term  environmental impact.      5.

MRD was designed and constructed in          accordance with DSOD requirements (Department of Water          Resources Certificate of Approval 3132, dated January 3,          1979). During construction, inspection and monitoring          will continue to ensure the dam is maintained and          dismantled consistent with DSOD requirements.            Periodic inspections are performed          monthly by EBMUD Operations. Annual inspections are also          performed by the Materials Engineering group at EBMUD and          State DSOD personnel. The Federal Energy Regulatory          Commission also performs annual inspections.            The Operations group of EBMUD is          responsible for inspection and maintenance of MRD.          Materials Engineering Group at EBMUD evaluates inspection          reports, and is responsible for safety aspects of the          dam.

If no change in metal concentration is          detected, further mitigation is not required. If an          increase in metals is detected, monitoring shall continue          to identify sources of contaminants, and additional          mitigation measures shall be considered.            A detailed monitoring plan will be          submitted to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (U.S.          EPA) for review and approval pursuant to a revised 309          Order. The monitoring plan will specify surface and          ground water sampling locations, sampling stations in          receiving waters, parameters to be analyzed, and the          frequency of sampling. The plan was described generally          in the Environmental Impact Report (EIR), and in the          Comment Response Document (CRD).            During construction, the existing treatment plant will          continue to operate, and sampling of discharges and          receiving waters will continue in accordance with the          requirements of the            U.S. EPA 309 Order, which requires monthly monitoring          reports.                       As required by the plan, EBMUD and          CVRWQCB staff, or their designees, will perform sampling,          and submit periodic reports to U.S. EPA and other          appropriate agencies, such as the SWRCB.

Following construction, EBMUD and the          CVRWQCB will monitor runoff from the site to assess the          effectiveness of the alternative. If monitoring          identifies previously unrecognized sources of          contaminates, additional measures, such as temporary          passive systems utilizing chemical neutralizers (e.g.,          limestone or organic soils) may be installed.            The monitoring program will include          inspection of the site and documentation of sampling and          analysis results to assess the effectiveness of the site          restoration.

GX014-38-2184244	STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD      RESOLUTION NO. 97-050      ADOPTION OF FINDINGS AND THE MITIGATION MONITORING PLAN REQUIRED  BY THE      CALIFORNIA ENVIROMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA) FOR APPROVAL OF THE  REMEDIATION PLAN UNDER WATER CODE SECTION 13397 ET SEQ . , FOR THE PENN  MINE SITE LONG-TERM SOLUTION PROJECT             WHEREAS:      1. On October 6, 1995, a Notice of Preparation of an Environmental Impact  Report for the Penn Mine Site Long -Term Solution Project (Project) was  prepared and later circulated by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality  Control Board (CVRWQCB) and East Bay Municipal Utilities District (EBMUD)  as co-lead agencies in accordance with the CEQA and applicable laws and  regulations; and      2. Volume I of a Draft Environmental Impact Report (Draft EIR) for the  Project (Volume I) , which identified seven alternative projects, and Volume  II of the draft EIR, which identified Alternative 5A as the preferred project,  were completed by the CVRWQCB and EBMUD; and      3. A final Environmental Impact Report on the Project (Final EIR) that  includes Volume I and II of the Draft EIR, as well as the Comment Response  Document (CRD) containing responses to all comments upon the Draft EIR received  by the CVRWQCB and EBMUD during the public comment period, and a Mitigation  Monitoring Plan (MMP) , were prepared by the CVRWQCB and EBMUD; and      4. At a public meeting of the CVRWQCB on February 28, 1997 in Sacramento,  California, the CVRWQCB certified the Final EIR, adopted the findings and  the MMP required by CEQA, and approved project after providing opportunity  for comments from interested parties upon the Project and Final EIR; and      5. At a public meeting of the EBMUD Board of Directors on February 25,  1997 in Oakland, California, the EBMUD Board certified the Final EIR, adopted  the findings and the MMP required by CEQA, and approved the Project after  providing opportunity for comments from interested parties upon the Project  and Final EIR; and      6. On May 16, 1997 the CVRWQCB and EBMUD jointly submitted to the State  Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) a remediation plan for the Penn Mine  Long- Term Solution Project (Remediation Plan) and requested the SWRCB to  approve it under Water Code Section 13397 et seq. ; and      7. CEQA requires a responsible agency to make certain findings regarding  the portion of the project being approved by the responsible agency. The  responsible agency must mitigate or avoid any significant Environmental  effect that is within its powers and that is caused by the portion of the  Project that it approves. The SWRCB is a responsible agency for approval  of the Remediation Plan. The SWRCB's powers are limited to protection of  water quality, including regulation of waste disposal to land and surface  water and protection of beneficial uses of water. The SWRCB also has jurisdiction  to regulate water rights, but no significant Environmental effects relating  to water rights are identified in the Final EIR. Therefore, this resolution  includes findings of mitigation of significant environmental effects regarding  landfill stability, water quality, and impacts of water quality on biological  resources.              THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT :      The SWRCB:      1. Finds the Project will provide long-term water quality protection  from the effects of acid rock drainage (ARD) derived from the abandoned  Penn Mine site located in the Sierra foothills near the inlet to Camanche  Reservoir on the Mokelumne River. The ARD historically has been collected  on site by several surface impoundments collected on the site by several  surface impoundments located in Hinkley Run and Mine Run Creeks. During  high precipitation events and during periods of sustained precipitation  and low evaporation, the capacity of the ponds has been exceeded, and pond  solutions have been discharged from the mine site to the Mokelumne River  or Camanche Reservoir. The project achieves source control through the excavation  and removal of 300,000 to 332,000 cubic yards of waste materials that will  be disposed of in an on-site landfill. All impoundments, including Mine  Run Dam will be removed to allow the restored Hinkley Run and Mine Run Creeks  to flow to Camanche Reservoir in their natural channels. A soil cover will  be placed over areas of remediation for comprehensive habitat and vegetation  restoration at the site.      2. Adopts an SWRCB Mitigation Monitoring Plan (SWRCB MMP) attached to  this resolution as Exhibit A and imposes the SWRCB MMP as a provision of  the remediation plan. These monitoring measures are imposed as conditions  for approval of the Remediation Plan.      3. Finds with respect to impacts of Alternative 5A, which were determined  in the Final EIR to be potentially significant impacts that can be reduced  to a less than significant level by imposition of mitigation measures within  the powers of the SWRCB:      a. Geology, Seismicity and Solis      Impact: As discussed in Volume I at pages 8-14 to 8-15, slope failure  and seismic ground shaking could damage on-site landfill for the disposal  of the mine waste material and the Mine Run Dam before it is dismantled.      Findings: The following mitigation measures as discussed at pages 8-15  to 8-17 of the Final EIR are hereby imposed as a provision of the Remediation  Plan and will be monitored in compliance with the SWRCB MMP. In order to  mitigate the potential slope failure of the on-site landfill due to excessive  erosion, landsliding, or earthquake ground shaking, the on-site landfill  shall be designed to meet or exceed the requirements of the California Code  of Regulations, Title 23, Chapter 15, for Group A mining wastes. Geological  investigations will be conducted, and the slopes will be designed to withstand  the appropriate design level earthquake. These mitigation measures will  reduce geological, seismic, and soil impacts to a level of insignificance.      b. Water Quality      Impact: As discussed in Volume I at pages 8-25 to 8-26, drainage with  the metal concentrations may be associated with the Alternative 5A for a  limited period after construction. Elevated levels of metals and other constituents,  such as sulfates, are most likely during the first few years after waste  removal, because fresh water flowing through the restored site will dissolve  and flush residual salts that have been deposited in shallow bedrock and  soil through leaching of the waste material over the last 150 years. Given  the three-year construction schedule, it is expected that a significant  portion of the flushing will occur during the wet season between the second  the third years of construction after waste has been removed, but before  Mine Run Dam is removed. During this period, before being dismantled, the  existing In-Line system (ILS) will continue to operate as necessary to treat  runoff in Mine Run Dam Reservoir (MRDR) so that significant discharge of  metals will not occur. During later years (after dam removal) , it is expected  that the large volumes of high quality water flowing through the site from  the Mine Run Creek and particularly Hinkley Run Creek drainages will result  in metal concentrations in surface water that are comparable to or less  that concentrations in our other ephemeral streams in the region. Concentrations  will decline as additional rainfall accumulates and as successive rainfall  events occur.      Findings: The following mitigation measures, as discussed at pages 8-29  to 8-30 of Volume I, page 43 of Volume II, and pages 15 and 19 of the CRD  of the Final EIR, are hereby imposed as a provision of the Remediation Plan  and will be monitored in compliance with the SWRCB MMP. There will be regular  monitoring of water quality in Camanche Reservoir near the site of Mine  Run Dam during construction of Alternative 5A implementation. During construction,  active waste treatment will continue with the existing ILS in conjunction  with surface water diversion and control in impoundments (potentially utilizing  evaporation) ; and the physical hydraulic flushing of the remediated areas  utilizing water hoses, or other equivalent means, during construction year  two after the site has been cleaned of all bulk waste materials. The water  generated by the flushing will be collected behind Mine Run Dam, treated,  and released to Camanche Reservoir. The final design of the Shaft No. 4  plug will consider the need for grouting in the area of the shaft opening.  Ground water extraction below MRDR will be considered if monitoring during  construction indicates that ground water presents a risk to receiving water.  After construction, if necessary to meet best management practices or other  standards, a passive anoxic, limestone, or other comparable method will  be used. These mitigation measures will reduce any water quality impacts  to a level of insignificance.      c. Biology      Impact: As discussed in Volume I at pages 8-54 to 8-55, release of metals  and other constituents to Camanche Reservoir could impact the fish or other  aquatic biologic communities. This impact is potentially significant, but  can be mitigated. Alternative 5A will moderately increase the discharge  of copper and zinc in both ground water and surface water, but should be  less than pre-Mine Run Dam conditions. Removal of surface impoundments and  waste in Hinkley Run and Mine Run Creeks will result in significantly lower  releases of metals within the Creeks, and may have a beneficial impact on  biological resources in the creeks. Although Alternative 5A will result  in moderately higher concentrations and loadings of metals to Camanche Reservoir  than existing with Mine Run Dam in place, these incremental increases may  not pose a substantial risk because, in terms of load reduction from historical  levels, there is very little absolute difference between Alternative 5A  and Alternative 1 (the existing condition as shown in Tables 4-22 and 4-23  on pages 4-112 and 4-113 of Volume I of the Final EIR). Based on physical  and chemical water quality mitigation measures approved herein, including  monitoring, it is not anticipated that fish in Camanche Reservoir with elevated  tissue levels of metals will be identified.      Findings: The following mitigation measures as discussed at pages 8-29  to 8-30 and 8-57 of Volume I are hereby imposed as provisions of the Remediation  Plan and will be monitored in compliance with the SWRCB MMP. Temporary measures  such as the operation of treatment systems during construction will be taken.  Treatment during construction will be taken. Treatment during construction  will avoid or minimize the potential impact of metal discharges (see findings  under b. Water Quality, above) . Since Camanche Reservoir will be avoided  as a result of the physical and chemical water quality mitigation measures  being implemented, including monitoring, bioassays will not be required.  These mitigation measures will reduce any health impacts to fish or humans  to a level of insignificance.      4. The SWRCB anticipates that all of the significant impacts within the  SWRCB's jurisdiction that are associated with implementation of Alternative  5A will be mitigated to a level of insignificance. However, to the extent  that implementation of Alternative 5A results in unavoidable impacts, the  SWRCB adopts and makes the following statement of Overriding Considerations  regarding the potentially unavoidable impact of Alternative 5A. and implementing  Alternative 5A. The SWRCB finds that any potentially avoidable impact is  overriden by and acceptable in light of the following benefits of adopting  and implementing Alternative 5A.      a. Alternative 5A will essentially eliminate the generation of ARD from  the Penn Mine site. This is a substantial beneficial impact of the project.      b. Alternative 5A will remove surface impoundments and mine waste from  Hinkley Run and Mine Run and Mine Run Creeks and restore their flow through  their natural channels. This will greatly improve water quality in these  creeks. Any increased metal loading in Camanche Reservoir and the Mokelumne  River is likely to be temporary and probably will be mitigated during project  implementation to an insignificant level. If it cannot be mitigated to insignificance,  there will be very little absolute difference in metal loadings between  Project Alternative 5A and the no action alternative.      After implementation of Alternative 5A, long-term water quality in the  Creeks, Camanche Reservoir, and the conditions before Mine Run Dam Reservoir  was installed. This is a substantial beneficial impact of the Project.      c. Alternative 5A includes substantial restoration of the physical and  biological environment at the site. This is a substantial long-term benefit  in comparison to any short-term environmental impact.      5.

Description of Nuclear Power Plants and Sites,    Plant Interaction with the Environment, and Environmental Impact Initiators    Associated with License Renewal     [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents  ]       2.1 Introduction       [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents     ]   Currently, 118 1  commercial nuclear power plants are located at 74 sites    in 33 of the contiguous United States. Of these, 57 sites are located east    of the Mississippi River, with most of this nuclear capacity located in the    Northeast (New England states, New York, and Pennsylvania); the Midwest    (Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin); and the Southeast (the Carolinas, Georgia,    Florida, and Alabama). No commercial nuclear power plants are located in Alaska    or Hawaii. Approximately half of these 74 sites contain two or three nuclear    units per site. Three of the 118 plants have been shut down and will be    decommissioned. The plant characteristics and environmental settings for these    nuclear power plant sites are provided in Appendix A. Table 2.1    provides a summary overview of the plants considered in preparing this Generic    Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS).   The total capacity of generating U.S. commercial nuclear power plants is approximately    99 GW(e), with plant generating capacities ranging from 67 MW(e) to    1270 MW(e). In 1992, the U.S. electric utility industry generated about    2.8 x 10 12  kWh, 21.6 percent of which was supplied by nuclear    power. The range of annual electricity production for these plants is approximately    390 x 10 6  kWh/year to 6900 x 10 6  kWh/year using    an assumed annual capacity factor of 62 percent. It is anticipated that    the electric utility industry will seek to operate many of these nuclear power    plants beyond the current operating license term of 40 years. This GEIS    examines how these plants and their interactions with the environment would    change if such plants were allowed to operate (under the proposed license renewal    regulation 10 CFR Part 54) for a maximum of 20 years past    the term of the original plant license of 40 years.   The purpose of this section is to provide an orientation from the perspective    of environmental considerations and assessments. Section 2.2 describes    commercial nuclear power plants and their major features and plant systems.    Section 2.3 describes the ways nuclear power plants interact with and affect    the environment. The license renewal rule, particularly its requirements that    may result in changes to nuclear plant environmental impacts, is discussed in    Section 2.4. Section 2.5 reviews the generation of particular environment impacts,    or precursors to such impacts, that are typical of current nuclear plant operation.    It discusses the ""baseline"" values to be used in comparing incremental effects    resulting from license renewal. Section 2.6 describes major refurbishment    activities and changes that could occur at nuclear power plants during license    renewal refurbishment and the extended years of operation. This section provides    the background for more thorough evaluations and environmental impact assessments    discussed in Sections 3 through 10.       2.2 Plant and Site Description and Plant Operation           [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents     ]   2.2.1 External Appearance and Setting   Nuclear power plants generally contain four main buildings or structures:       Containment or reactor building. A massive containment structure that houses      the reactor vessel, the suppression pool [boiling-water reactors (BWRs) only],      steam generators, pressurizer [pressurized-water reactors (PWRs) only], pumps,      and associated piping. The building is generally designed to withstand such      disasters as hurricanes, earthquakes, and aircraft collisions. The containment's      ability to withstand such disasters, as well as the effects of accidents initiated      by system failures, is the principal deterrent to release of radioactive materials      to the environment.     Turbine building. Plant structures that house the steam turbine and generator,      condenser, waste heat rejection system, pumps, and equipment that supports      those systems.     Auxiliary buildings. Buildings that house such support systems as the ventilation      system, the emergency core cooling system, the water treatment system, and      the waste treatment system, along with fuel storage facilities and the plant      control room.     Cooling towers. Structures designed to remove excess heat from the condenser      without dumping such heat directly into water bodies.     A plant site also contains a large switchyard, where the electric voltage is    stepped up and fed into the regional power distribution system, and may also    include various administrative and security buildings. During the operating    life of a plant, its basic appearance remains unchanged.   Typically, nuclear power plant sites and the surrounding area are flat-to-rolling    countryside in wooded or agricultural areas. More than 50 percent of the    sites have 80-km (50-mile) population densities of less than 200 persons per    square mile, and over 80 percent have 80-km (50-mile) densities of less    than 500 persons per square mile. The most notable exception is the Indian Point    Station, located within 80 km (50 miles) of New York City, which has a    projected 1990 population density within 80 km (50 miles) of almost 2000    persons per square mile.   Site areas range from 34 ha (84 acres) for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating    Station in California to 12,000 ha (30,000 acres) for the McGuire Nuclear Station    in North Carolina. As shown in Table 2.1, 28 site areas range    from 200 to 400 ha (500 to 1000 acres), and an additional 12 sites are in the    400- to 800-ha (1000- to 2000-acre) range. Thus, almost 60 percent of the    plant sites encompass 200 to 800 ha (500 to 2000 acres). Larger land-use    areas are associated with plant cooling systems that include reservoirs, artificial    lakes, and buffer areas.   2.2.2 Reactor Systems   U.S. reactors employed for domestic electric power generation are conventional    (thermal) light-water reactors (LWRs), using water as moderator and coolant.    The two types of LWRs are PWRs ( Figure 2.1 ) and    BWRs ( Figure 2.2 ). Of the 118 power reactors in the United    States, 80 are PWRs and 38 are BWRs.

Figure 2.1  Pressurized-water-reactor power generation    system.   Figure 2.2  Boiling-water-reactor generating system.   In the PWR, reactor heat is transferred from the primary coolant to a secondary    coolant loop that is at a lower pressure, allowing steam to be generated in    the steam generator. The steam then flows to a turbine for power production.    In contrast, the BWR generates steam directly within the reactor core, which    passes through moisture separators and steam dryers and then flows to the turbine.   All domestic power reactors employ a containment structure as a major safety    feature to prevent the release of radionuclides in the event of an accident.    PWRs employ three types of containments: (1) large, dry containments; (2) subatmospheric    containments; and (3) ice condenser containments. Of the 80 U.S. PWRs,    65 have large, dry containments; 7 have subatmospheric containments;    and 8 have ice condenser containments. BWR containments typically are composed    of a suppression pool and dry well. Three types of BWR containments (Mark I,    Mark II, and Mark III) have evolved. There are 24 Mark I, 10 Mark II,    and 4 Mark III containment designs in the United States.   NUREG/CR-5640 provides a comprehensive overview and description of U.S.    commercial nuclear power plant systems.   2.2.3 Cooling and Auxiliary Water Systems   The predominant water use at a nuclear power plant is for removing excess heat    generated in the reactor by condenser cooling. The quantity of water used for    condenser cooling is a function of several factors, including the capacity rating    of the plant and the increase in cooling water temperature from the intake to    the discharge. The larger the plant, the greater the quantity of waste heat    to be dissipated, and the greater the quantity of cooling water required.   In addition to removing heat from the reactor, cooling water is also provided    to the service water system and to the auxiliary cooling water system. The volume    of water required for these systems for once-through cooling is usually less    than 15 percent of the volume required for condenser cooling. In closed-cycle    cooling, the additional water needed is usually less than 5 percent of    that needed for condenser cooling.   Of the 118 nuclear reactors, 48 use closed-cycle cooling systems (see Table 2.2,    which groups the 74 plant sites into three broad categories according to environment).    Most closed-cycle systems use cooling towers. Some closed-cycle system units    use a cooling lake or canals for transferring heat to the atmosphere. Once-through    cooling systems are used at 70 units. A few of these systems are augmented    with helper cooling towers to reduce the temperature of the effluent released    to the adjacent body of water.   In closed-cycle systems, the cooling water is recirculated through the condenser    after the waste heat is removed by dissipation to the atmosphere, usually by    circulating the water through large cooling towers constructed for that purpose.    Several types of closed-cycle cooling systems are currently used by the nuclear    power industry. Recirculating cooling systems consist of either natural draft    or mechanical draft cooling towers, cooling ponds, cooling lakes, or cooling    canals. Because the predominant cooling mechanism associated with closed-cycle    systems is evaporation, most of the water used for cooling is consumed and is not returned to a water source.

Of the 70 plants with    once-through cooling systems, 24 discharge to a river, 11 discharge to the Great    Lakes, 19 discharge to the ocean or an estuary, and 16 discharge to a reservoir    or lake. Five of the once-through plants can also switch to cooling towers.    In a once-through cooling system, circulating water for condenser cooling is    drawn from an adjacent body of water, such as a lake or river, passed through    the condenser tubes, and returned at a higher temperature to the adjacent body    of water. The waste heat is dissipated to the atmosphere mainly by evaporation    from the water body and, to a much smaller extent, by conduction, convection,    and thermal radiation loss.   All sites with two or three reactors use the same cooling system for all reactors,    except for two sites: Arkansas Nuclear One in Arkansas and Nine Mile Point in    New York. These two sites use once-through cooling for one unit and closed-cycle    for the other.   For both once-through and closed-cycle cooling systems, the water intake and    discharge structures are of various configurations to accommodate the source    water body and to minimize impact to the aquatic ecosystem. The intake structures    are generally located along the shoreline of the body of water and are equipped    with fish protection devices (ORNL/TM-6472). The discharge structures are generally    of the jet or diffuser outfall type and are designed to promote rapid mixing    of the effluent stream with the receiving body of water. Biocides and other    chemicals used for corrosion control and for other water treatment purposes    are mixed with the condenser cooling water and discharged from the system.   In addition to surface water sources, some nuclear power plants use groundwater    as a source for service water, makeup water, or potable water. Other plants    operate dewatering systems to intentionally lower the groundwater table, either    by pumping or by using a system of drains, in the vicinity of building foundations.   2.2.4 Radioactive Waste Treatment Systems   During the fission process, a large inventory of radioactive fission products    builds up within the fuel. Virtually all of the fission products are contained    within the fuel pellets. The fuel pellets are enclosed in hollow metal rods    (cladding), which are hermetically sealed to further prevent the release of    fission products. However, a small fraction of the fission products escapes    the fuel rods and contaminates the reactor coolant. The primary system coolant    also has radioactive contaminants as a result of neutron activation. The radioactivity    in the reactor coolant is the source of gaseous, liquid, and solid radioactive    wastes at LWRs.   The following sections describe the basic design and operation of PWR and BWR    radioactive-waste-treatment systems.   2.2.4.1 Gaseous Radioactive Waste   For BWRs, the sources of routine radioactive gaseous emissions to the atmosphere    are the air ejector, which removes noncondensable gases from the coolant to    improve power conversion efficiency, and gaseous and vapor leakages, which,    after monitoring and filtering, are discharged to the atmosphere via the building    ventilation systems.   The off-gas treatment system collects noncondensable gases and vapors that    are exhausted at the condenser via the air ejectors. These off-gases are processed    through a series of delay systems and filters to remove airborne radioactive    particulates and halogens, thereby minimizing the quantities of the radionuclides    that might be released. Building ventilation system exhausts are another source    of gaseous radioactive wastes for BWRs.    PWRs have three primary sources of gaseous radioactive emissions:       discharges from the gaseous waste management system;     discharges associated with the exhaust of noncondensable gases at the main      condenser if a primary-to-secondary system leak exists; and     radioactive gaseous discharges from the building ventilation exhaust, including      the reactor building, reactor auxiliary building, and fuel-handling building.     The gaseous waste management system collects fission products, mainly noble    gases, that accumulate in the primary coolant. A small portion of the primary    coolant flow is continually diverted to the primary coolant purification, volume,    and chemical control system to remove contaminants and adjust the coolant chemistry    and volume. During this process, noncondensable gases are stripped and routed    to the gaseous waste management system, which consists of a series of gas storage    tanks. The storage tanks allow the short-half-life radioactive gases to decay,    leaving only relatively small quantities of long-half-life radionuclides to    be released to the atmosphere. Some PWRs are using charcoal delay systems rather    than gas storage tanks (e.g., Seabrook).   2.2.4.2 Liquid Radioactive Waste   Radionuclide contaminants in the primary coolant are the source of liquid radioactive    waste in LWRs. The specific sources of these wastes, the modes of collection    and treatment, and the types and quantities of liquid radioactive wastes released    to the environment are in many respects similar in BWRs and PWRs. Accordingly,    the following discussion applies to both BWRs and PWRs, with distinctions made    only where important differences exist.   Liquid wastes resulting from LWR operation may be placed into the following    categories: clean wastes, dirty wastes, detergent wastes, turbine building floor-drain    water, and steam generator blowdown (PWRs only).  Clean wastes  include    all liquid wastes with a normally low conductivity and variable radioactivity    content. They consist of reactor grade water, which is amenable to processing    for reuse as reactor coolant makeup water. Clean wastes are collected from equipment    leaks and drains, certain valve and pump seal leaks not collected in the reactor    coolant drain tank, and other aerated leakage sources. These wastes also include    primary coolant.  Dirty wastes  include all liquid wastes with a moderate    conductivity and variable radioactivity content that, after processing, may    be used as reactor coolant makeup water. Dirty wastes consist of liquid wastes    collected in the containment building sump, auxiliary building sumps and drains,    laboratory drains, sample station drains, and other miscellaneous floor drains.     Detergent wastes  consist principally of laundry wastes and personnel    and equipment decontamination wastes and normally have a low radioactivity content.     Turbine building floor-drain wastes  usually have high conductivity    and low radionuclide content. In PWRs,  steam generator blowdown  can    have relatively high concentrations of radionuclides depending on the amount    of primary-to-secondary leakage. Following processing, the water may be reused    or discharged.   Each of these sources of liquid wastes receives varying degrees and types of    treatment before storage for reuse or discharge to the environment under the    site National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The extent    and types of treatment depend on the chemical and radionuclide content of the    waste; to increase the efficiency of waste processing, wastes of similar characteristics    are batched before treatment.   The degree of processing, storing, and recycling of liquid radioactive waste    has steadily increased among operating plants. For example, extensive recycling    of steam generator blowdown in PWRs is now the typical mode of operation, and    secondary side wastewater is routinely treated. In addition, the plant systems    used to process wastes are often augmented with the use of commercial mobile    processing systems. As a result, radionuclide releases in liquid effluent from    LWRs have generally declined or remained the same.   2.2.4.3 Solid Radioactive Waste   Solid low-level radioactive waste (LLW) from nuclear power plants is generated    by removal of radionuclides from liquid waste streams, filtration of airborne    gaseous emissions, and removal of contaminated material from various reactor    areas. Liquid contaminated with radionuclides comes from primary and secondary    coolant systems, spent-fuel pools, decontaminated wastewater, and laboratory    operations. Concentrated liquids, filter sludges, waste oils, and other liquid    sources are segregated by type, flushed to storage tanks, stabilized for packaging    in a solid form by dewatering, slurried into 55-gal steel drums, and stored    on-site in shielded Butler-style buildings or other facilities until suitable    for off-site disposal (NUREG/CR-2907). These buildings usually contain volume    reduction facilities to reduce the volume of LLW requiring off-site disposal    (EPRI NP-5526-V1).   High-efficiency particulate filters are used to remove radioactive material    from gaseous plant effluents. These filters are compacted in volume reduction    facilities that have volume reduction equipment and are disposed of as solid    wastes.   Solid LLW consists of contaminated protective clothing, paper, rags, glassware,    compactible and noncompactible trash, and non-fuel-irradiated reactor components    and equipment. Most of this waste comes from plant modifications and routine    maintenance activities. Additional sources include tools and other material    exposed to the reactor environment (EPRI-NP-5526-V1; EPRI NP-5526-V2). Before    disposal, compactible trash is usually taken to on- or off-site VR facilities.    Compacted dry active waste is the largest single form of LLW disposed from nuclear    plants, comprising one-half and one-third of total average annual volumes from    PWRs and BWRs, respectively (EPRI NP-5526V1).   Volume reduction efforts have been undertaken in response to increased disposal    costs and the passage of the 1980 Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act and    the 1985 Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act (LLRWPAA) (Pub. L. 96-573;    Pub. L. 99-240), which require LLW disposal allocation systems for    nuclear plants (see Section 6.3). Volume reduction is performed both on- and    off-site. The most common on-site volume reduction techniques are high-pressure    compacting of waste drums, dewatering and evaporating wet wastes, monitoring    waste streams to segregate wastes, minimizing the exposure of routine equipment    to contamination, and decontaminating and sorting radioactive or nonradioactive    batches before off-site shipment. Off-site waste management vendors compact    compactible wastes at ultra-high pressure (supercompaction); incinerate dry    active waste; separate and incinerate oily, organic wastes; solidify the ash;    and occasionally undertake waste crystallization and asphalt solidification    of resins and sludges (EPRI NP-6163; EPRI NP-5526-V1; EPRI NP-5526-V2;    DOE/RW-0220).   Spent fuel contains fission products and actinides produced when nuclear fuel    is irradiated in reactors, as well as any unburned, unfissioned nuclear fuel    remaining after the fuel rods have been removed from the reactor core. After    spent fuel is removed from reactors, it is stored in racks placed in storage    pools to isolate it from the environment. Delays in siting an interim monitored    retrievable storage (MRS) facility or permanent repository, coupled with rapidly    filling spent-fuel pools, have led utilities to seek other storage solutions,    including expansion of existing pools, aboveground dry storage, longer fuel    burnup, and shipment of spent fuel to other plants (Gerstberger 1987; DOE RW-0220).   Pool storage has been increased through (1) enlarging the capacity of    spent-fuel racks, (2) adding racks to existing pool arrays (""dense-racking""),    (3) reconfiguring spent fuel with neutron-absorbing racks, and (4) employing    double-tiered storage (installing a second tier of racks above those on the    pool floor).   Efforts are under way to develop dry storage technologies; these ude casks,    silos, dry wells, and vaults (DOE December 1989). Dry storage facilities    are simpler and more readily maintained than fuel pools. They are growing in    favor because they offer a more stable means of storage and require relatively    little land area (less than 0.2 ha--half an acre in most cases) (Johnson    1989). Dry storage is currently in use at about 5 percent of the sites.   2.2.4.4 Transportation of Radioactive Materials   There are four types of radioactive material shipments to and from nuclear    plants: (1) routine and refurbishment-generated LLW transported from plants    to disposal facilities, (2) routine LLW shipped to off-site facilities    for volume reduction, (3) nuclear fuel shipments from fuel fabrication    facilities to plants for loading into reactors (generally occurring on a 12-    to 18-month cycle), and (4) spent-fuel shipments to other nuclear power    plants with available storage space (an infrequent occurrence usually limited    to plants owned by the same utility).   Workers and others are protected from exposure during radioactive material    transport by the waste packaging. Operational restrictions on transport vehicles,    ambient radiation monitoring, imposition of licensing standards (which ensure    proper waste certification by testing and analysis of packages), waste solidification,    and training of emergency personnel to respond to mishaps are also used (NUREG-0170;    O'Sullivan 1988). Additional regulations may be imposed by states and communities    along transportation corridors (Pub. L. 93-633; OTA-SET-304).   A typical PWR makes approximately 44 shipments of LLW per year; an average    BWR makes 104 shipments per year (EPRI NP-5983). Most of this LLW is Class A    waste packaged in 55-gal drums or other ""Type A"" containers and shipped    to disposal facilities on flatbed trucks (DOE August 1989). (A ""Type A""    container permits no release of radioactive material under normal transportation    conditions and must maintain sufficient shielding to limit radiation exposure    to handling personnel). LLW shipments require manifests that describe the contents    of the packages to permit inspection by state, local, and facility personnel    and to ensure that the waste is suitable for a particular disposal facility    (NUREG-0945).   Currently, the only spent-fuel shipments from nuclear plants are to other plants.    A few spent-fuel shipments have, in the past, been made to fuel reprocessing    plants. These shipments are packaged in ""Type B"" casks designed to retain the    highly radioactive contents under normal and accident conditions. These containers    range in size from 23-36 metric tons (25-40 tons) for truck shipment (each    cask is capable of holding seven fuel assemblies) to 109 metric tons (120 tons)    for rail transport (with a capacity for 36 assemblies) (DOE/RW-0065). The    casks are resistant to both small-arms fire and high-explosive detonation (NUREG-0170).   2.2.5 Nonradioactive Waste Systems   Nonradioactive wastes from nuclear power plants include boiler blowdown (continual    or periodic purging of impurities from plant boilers), water treatment wastes    (sludges and high saline streams whose residues are disposed of as solid waste    and biocides), boiler metal cleaning wastes, floor and yard drains, and stormwater    runoff. Principal chemical and biocide waste sources include the following:       Boric acid used to control reactor power and lithium hydroxide used to control      pH in the coolant. (These chemicals could be inadvertently released because      of pipe or steam generator leakage.)     Sulfuric acid, which is added to the circulating water system to control      scale.     Hydrazine, which is used for corrosion control. (It is released in steam      generator blowdown.)     Sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid, which are used to regenerate resins.      (These are discharged after neutralization.)     Phosphate in cleaning solutions.     Biocides used for condenser defouling.     Other small volumes of wastewater are released from other plant systems depending    on the design of each plant. These are discharged from such sources as the service    water and auxiliary cooling systems, water treatment plant, laboratory and sampling    wastes, boiler blowdown, floor drains, stormwater runoff, and metal treatment    wastes. These waste streams are discharged as separate point sources or are    combined with the cooling water discharges.   2.2.6 Nuclear Power Plant Operation and Maintenance   Nuclear power reactors are capable of generating electricity continuously for    long periods of time. However, they operate neither at maximum capacity nor    continuously for the entire term of their license. Plants can typically operate    continuously for periods of time ranging from 1 year to 18 months    on a single fuel load. Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance outages and less    than peak power generation resulting from diminished consumer demand, or operational    decisions, have reduced the power output for the U.S. nuclear power industry    as a whole to an average annual capacity of between 58 and 73 percent of the    maximum capability for the years 1975 through 1993, inclusive (NUREG-1350, vol. 6).     Maintenance activities are routinely performed on systems and components to    help ensure the safe and reliable operation of the plant. In addition, inspection,    testing, and surveillance activities are conducted throughout the operational    life of a nuclear power plant to maintain the current licensing basis of the    plant and ensure compliance with federal, state, and local requirements regarding    the environment and public safety.   Nuclear power plants must periodically discontinue the production of electricity    for refueling, periodic in-service inspection (ISI), and scheduled maintenance.    Refueling cycles occur approximately every 12 to 18 months. The duration of    a refueling outage is typically on the order of 2 months. Enhanced or expanded    inspection and surveillance activities are typically performed at 5- and 10-year    intervals. These enhanced inspections are performed to comply with Nuclear Regulatory    Commission (NRC) and/or industry standards or requirements such as the American    Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Five-year ISIs    are scheduled for the 5th, 15th, 25th, and 35th years of operation, and 10-year    ISIs are performed in the 10th, 20th, and 30th years. Each of these outages    typically requires 2 to 4 months of down time for the plant. For economic reasons,    many of these activities are conducted simultaneously (e.g., refueling activities    typically coincide with the ISI and maintenance activities).    Many plants also undertake various major refurbishment activities during their    operational lives. These activities are performed to ensure both that the plant    can be operated safely and that the capacity and reliability of the plant remain    at acceptable levels. Typical major refurbishments that have occurred in the    past include replacing PWR steam generators, replacing BWR recirculation piping,    and rebuilding main steam turbine stages. The need to perform major refurbishments    is highly plant-specific and depends on factors such as design features, operational    history, and construction and fabrication details. The plants may remain out    of service for extended periods of time, ranging from a few months to more than    a year, while these major refurbishments are accomplished. Outage durations    vary considerably, depending on factors such as the scope of the repairs or    modifications undertaken, the effectiveness of the outage planning, and the    availability of replacement parts and components.   Each nuclear power plant is part of a utility system that may own several nuclear    power plants, fossil-fired plants, or other means of generating electricity.    An on-site staff is responsible for the actual operation of each plant, and    an off-site staff may be headquartered at the plant site or some other location.    Typically, from 800 to 2300 people are employed at nuclear power plant sites    during periods of normal operation, depending on the number of operating reactors    located at a particular site. The permanent on-site work force is usually in    the range of 600 to 800 people per reactor unit. However, during outage periods,    the on-site work force typically increases by 200 to 900 additional workers.    The additional workers include engineering support staff, technicians, specialty    craftspersons, and laborers called in both to perform specialized repairs, maintenance,    tests, and inspections and to assist the permanent staff with the more routine    activities carried out during plant outages.   2.2.7 Power-Transmission Systems   Power-transmission systems associated with nuclear power plants consist of    switching stations (or substations) located on the plant site and transmission    lines located primarily off-site. These systems are required to transfer power    from the generating station to the utility's network of power lines in its service    area.   Switching stations transfer power from generating sources to power lines and    regulate the operation of the power system. Transformers in switching stations    convert the generated voltage to voltage levels appropriate for the power lines.    Equipment for regulating system operation includes switches, power circuit breakers,    meters, relays, microwave communication equipment, capacitors, and a variety    of other electrical equipment. This equipment meters and controls power flow;    improves performance characteristics of the generated power; and protects generating    equipment from short circuits, lightning strikes, and switching surges that    may occur along the power lines. Switching stations occupy on-site areas generally    two to four times as large as areas occupied by reactor and generator buildings,    but are not as visible as the plant buildings.   The length of power transmission lines constructed for nuclear plants varies    from a few miles for some plants to hundreds of miles for others. Power line    systems include towers (structures), insulator strings, conductors, and ground    wires strung between towers. Power lines associated with nuclear plants usually    have voltages of 230 kV, 345 kV, 500 kV, or 765 kV (see    Section 4.5.1). They operate at a low frequency of 60 Hz (60 cycles    per second) compared with frequencies of 55-890 MHz for television transmitters    and 1000 MHz and greater for microwaves.   Most power line towers are double wooden poles (""H-frame"" structure) or metal    lattice structures that support one or two sets of conductors (three conductors    per set; see Section 4.5.1). Tower height, usually between 21 and 51 m    (70 and 170 ft), increases with line voltage. Strings of insulators    connect the conductors to the towers. The tops of the towers support two ground    wires that transmit the energy of lightning strikes to the ground. Thus, the    ground wires prevent lightning strikes to the conductors, minimize the occurrence    of power system outages, and protect vital power system components that could    be damaged by lightning-caused power surges on the conductors.       2.3 Plant Interaction with the Environment          [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents     ]   This section describes how nuclear plants interact with the environment. Nuclear    power plants are sited, designed, and operated to minimize impacts to the environment,    including plant workers. Land that could be used for other purposes is dedicated    to electric power production for the life of the plant. The aesthetics of the    landscape are altered because of the new plant structures; the surface and groundwater    hydrology and terrestrial and aquatic ecology may be affected; the air quality    may be affected; and, finally, the community infrastructure and services are    altered to accommodate the influx of workers into the area. The environmental    impact from plant operation is determined largely by waste effluent streams    (gaseous, liquid, and solid); the plant cooling systems; the exposure of plant    workers to radiation; and plant expenditures, taxes, and jobs.   Operational activities associated with nuclear power plants, including maintenance    actions, often produce liquid discharges that are released to the surrounding    environment. The major liquid effluent occurs in once-through cooling systems    which discharge heat and chemicals into a receiving body of water, but all nuclear    power plants have liquid effluents to some extent. To operate, power plants    must obtain an NPDES permit that specifies discharge standards and monitoring    requirements, and they are required to be strictly in compliance with the limits    set by the permit. NPDES permits are issued by the Environmental Protection    Agency (EPA) or a designated state water quality agency. They must be renewed    every 5 years.   Any gaseous effluents generated are similarly controlled by the EPA and state    permitting agencies, which require compliance with the Clean Air Act and any    amendments added by the states. On-site incineration of waste products is controlled    in this manner.    2.3.1 Land Use   Nuclear power plants are large physical entities. Land requirements generally    amount to several hundred hectares for the plant site, of which 20 to 40 ha    (50 to 100 acres) may actually be disturbed during plant construction.    Other land commitments can amount to many thousands of hectares for transmission    line rights-of-way (ROWs) and cooling lakes, when such a cooling option is used.   Nuclear power plants that began initial operation after the promulgation of    the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190) or the Endangered    Species Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-205) are sited and operate in compliance with    these laws. Any modifications to the plants after the effective dates of these    acts must be in compliance with the requirements of these laws. The Endangered    Species Act applies to both terrestrial and aquatic biota. The individual states    may also have requirements regarding threatened and endangered species; the    state-listed species may vary from those on the federal lists.   2.3.2 Water Use   Nuclear power plants withdraw large amounts of mainly surface water to meet    a variety of plant needs (Section 2.2.3). Water withdrawal rates are large    from adjacent bodies of water for plants with once-through cooling systems.    Flow through the condenser for a 1,000-MW(e) plant may be 45 to 65 m 3 /s    (700,000 to 1,000,000 gal/min). Water lost by evaporation from the heated    discharge is about 60 percent of that which is lost through cooling towers.    Additional water needs for service water, auxiliary systems, and radioactive    waste systems account for 1 to 15 percent of that needed for    condenser cooling.   Water withdrawal from adjacent bodies of water for plants with closed-cycle    cooling systems is 5 to 10 percent of that for plants with once-through    cooling systems, with much of this water being used for makeup of water by evaporation.    With once-through cooling systems, evaporative losses are about 40 percent    less but occur externally in the adjacent body of water instead of in the closed-cycle    system. The average makeup water withdrawals for several recently constructed    plants having closed-cycle cooling, normalized to 1,000 MW(e), are about    0.9 to 1.1 m 3 /s (14,000 to 18,000 gal/min). Variation results    from cooling tower design, concentration factor of recirculated water, climate    at the site, plant operating conditions, and other plant-specific factors.   Consumptive loss normalized to 1,000 MW(e) is about 0.7 m 3 /s    (11,200 gal/min), which is about 80 percent of the water volume taken    in. Consumptive water losses remove surface water from other uses downstream.    In those areas experiencing water availability problems, nuclear power plant    consumption may conflict with other existing or potential closed-cycle uses    (e.g., municipal and agricultural water withdrawals) and in-stream uses (e.g.,    adequate in-stream flows to protect aquatic biota, recreation, and riparian    communities). The environmental impacts of consumptive water use are considered    in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.   As discussed in Section 2.2.3, some nuclear power plants use groundwater    as an additional source of water. The rate of usage varies greatly among users.    Many plants use groundwater only for the potable water system and require less    than 0.006 m 3 /s (100 gal/min); however, withdrawals at other    sites can range from 0.02 to 0.2 m 3 /s (400 to 3000 gal/min). Impacts    associated with groundwater use are discussed in Sections 4.2.2, 4.3.2,    and 4.4.3.   Nuclear plant water usage must comply with state and local regulations. Most    states require permits for surface water usage. Groundwater usage regulations    vary considerably from state to state, and permits are typically required.   2.3.3 Water Quality   Water quality is impacted by the numerous nonradioactive liquid effluents discharged    from nuclear power plants (Section 2.1.6). Discharges from the heat dissipation    system account for the largest volumes of water and usually the greatest potential    impacts to water quality and aquatic systems, although other systems may contribute    heat and toxic chemical contaminants to the effluent. The relatively small volumes    of water required for the service water and auxiliary cooling water systems    do not generally raise concerns about thermal or chemical impacts to the receiving    body of water. However, because effluents from these systems contain contaminants    that could be toxic to aquatic biota, their concentrations are regulated under    the power plant's NPDES discharge permit. The quality of groundwater may also    be diminished by water from cooling ponds seeping into the underlying groundwater    table.   Sewage wastes and cleaning solvents, including phosphate cleaning solutions,    are treated as sanitary wastes. They are treated before release to the environment    so that, after release, their environmental impacts are minimized. In cases    where nonradioactive sanitary or other wastes cannot be processed by on-site    water treatment systems, the wastes are collected by independent contractors    and trucked to off-site treatment facilities. Water quality issues relate to    the following: NPDES permit system for regulating low-volume wastewater, adequate    wastewater treatment capacity to handle increased flow and loading associated    with operational changes to the plant and discharges of wastes through emission    of phosphates from utility laundries, suspended solids and coliforms from sewage    treatment discharges, and other effluents that cause excessive biological oxygen    demand.   Many power plants are periodically treated with biocidal chemicals (most commonly    some form of chlorine) to control fouling and bacterial slimes. Discharge of    these chemicals to the receiving body of water can have toxic effects on aquatic    organisms. The biological and water quality impacts of discharges from the discharge    systems are considered in Sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4.   Chlorine is used widely as a biocide at nuclear power plants and represents    the largest potential source of chemically toxic release to the aquatic environment.    Chlorine application as a cooling system biocide is typically by injection in    one of several different forms, including chlorine gas or sodium hypochlorite.    It may be injected at the intake or targeted at various points (such as the    condensers) on an intermittent or continuous basis. Such treatments control    certain pest organisms such as the Asiatic clam or the growth of bacterial or    fungal slime (TVA 1978). The control of biological pests or growths is critical    to maintaining optimum system performance and minimizing operating costs (EPRI    CS-3748).   Because of the evolution of the guidelines pertaining to chlorine and changes    in biocide technologies over the past 15 years, the potential for any adverse    impacts of chlorine has been decreasing. Improvements in dechlorination technologies    are likely to significantly reduce the level of chlorine in the aquatic environment.    Given the critical need for controlling biofouling in the cooling system, both    alternative and chlorine treatment technologies are expected to keep pace with    regulatory requirements.   All effluent discharges are regulated under the provisions of the Clean Water    Act and the implementing effluent guidelines, limitations, and standards established    by EPA and the states. Conditions of discharge for each plant are specified    in its NPDES permit issued by the state or EPA.   2.3.4 Air Quality   Transmission lines have been associated with the production of minute amounts    of ozone and oxides of nitrogen. These issues are associated with corona, the    breakdown of air very near the high-voltage conductors. Corona is most noticeable    for the higher-voltage lines and during foul weather. Through the years, line    designs have been developed that greatly reduce corona effects.   The effluents created and released from the incineration of any waste products    must comply with EPA and state requirements regarding air quality. Permits for    release of controlled amounts of these effluents to the atmosphere are controlled    by state permitting agencies. Because nuclear power plants generally do not    produce gaseous effluents, the impact on air quality is minimal.   2.3.5 Aquatic Resources   Operation of the once-through (condenser cooling) system requires large amounts    of water that are withdrawn directly from surface waters. These surface waters    contain aquatic organisms that may be injured or killed through their interactions    with the power plant. Aquatic organisms that are too large to pass through the    intake debris screens, which commonly have a 1-cm (0.4-in.) mesh, and that cannot    move away from the intake, may be impinged against the screens. If the organisms    are held against the screen for long periods, they will suffocate; if they receive    severe abrasions, they may die. Impingement can harm large numbers of fish and    large invertebrates (e.g., crabs, shrimp, and jellyfish).   Aquatic organisms that are small enough to pass through the debris screens    will travel through the entire condenser cooling system and be exposed to heat,    mechanical, and pressure stresses, and possibly biocidal chemicals, before being    discharged back to the body of water. This process, called entrainment, may    affect a wide variety of small plants (phytoplankton), invertebrates (zooplankton),    fish eggs, and larvae (ichthyoplankton). Entrainment mortality is variable.    Conditions at some plants with once-through cooling may result in relatively    low levels of mortality, although at such plants the volumes of water (and numbers    of entrained organisms) are often high. On the other hand, generally no aquatic    organisms survive at plants with closed-cycle cooling that recirculate water    through cooling towers, although the volumes of water withdrawn are relatively    low. Biological effects of entrainment and impingement are considered in Section 4.2.3.   Discharges from the plant heat rejection system may affect the receiving body    of water through heat loading and chemical contaminants, most notably chlorine    or other biocides. Heated effluents can kill aquatic organisms directly by either    heat shock or cold shock. In addition, a number of indirect or sublethal stresses    are associated with thermal discharges that have the potential to alter aquatic    communities (e.g., increased incidence of disease, predation, or parasitism,    as well as changes in dissolved gas concentrations).   As stated in Section 2.3.3, all effluent discharges are regulated by the Clean    Water Act and standards established by the EPA and the individual states. Conditions    of discharge for each plant are specified in the NPDES permit issued for that    plant.   2.3.6 Terrestrial Resources   A number of ongoing issues associated with terrestrial resources can arise    in the immediate area around the plant or its power transmission lines. Most    power lines are located on easements (or ROWs) that the utility purchased from    the landowner. Land uses on the easements are limited to activities compatible    with power-line operation. In areas with rapidly growing vegetation, utilities    must periodically cut or spray the vegetation to prevent it from growing so    close to the conductors that it causes short circuits and endangers power line    operation. Other terrestrial resource issues can result from changes in local    hydrology. Such changes can occur from altered contouring of the land, reduced    tree cover, and increased paving. These changes can reduce the value of land    and contribute to local erosion and flooding. Additional impacts can include    the effects of cooling tower effluent drift, reduced habitat for plants and    animals, disruption of animal transit routes, and bird collisions with cooling    towers and transmission lines.   Each plant planning to apply for license renewal will need to consult with    the appropriate agency administering the Endangered Species Act of 1973 about    the presence of threatened or endangered species. Compliance with the Endangered    Species Act will be a necessary part of each plant's environmental documentation    at the time of license renewal.   2.3.7 Radiological Impacts   2.3.7.1 Occupational Exposures   Plant workers conducting activities involving radioactively contaminated systems    or working in radiation areas can be exposed to radiation. Most of the occupational    radiation dose to nuclear plant workers results from external radiation exposure    rather than from internal exposure from inhaled or ingested radioactive materials.    Experience has shown that the dose to nuclear plant workers varies from reactor    to reactor and from year to year. Since the early 1980s, when NRC regulatory    requirements and guidance placed increased emphasis on maintaining nuclear power    plant occupational radiation exposures as low as reasonably achievable, there    has been a decreasing trend in the average annual dose per nuclear plant worker.   The effect of plant refurbishment on occupational doses is evaluated in Sections 3.8.2    and in Appendix B. Similarly, the effect of continued operation associated with    license renewal on occupational doses is evaluated in Section 4.6.3.   2.3.7.2 Public Radiation Exposures   Commercial nuclear power reactors, under controlled conditions, release small    amounts of radioactive materials to the environment during normal operation.    These releases result in radiation doses to humans that are small relative to    doses from natural radioactivity. Nuclear power plant licensees must comply    with NRC regulations (e.g., 10 CFR Part 20, Appendix I to    10 CFR Part 50, 10 CFR Part 50.36a, and 40 CFR Part 190)    and conditions specified in the operating license.   Potential environmental pathways through which persons may be exposed to radiation    originating in a nuclear power reactor include atmospheric and aquatic pathways.    Radioactive materials released under controlled conditions include fission products    and activation products. Fission product releases consist primarily of the noble    gases and some of the more volatile materials like tritium, isotopes of iodine,    and cesium. These materials are monitored carefully before release to determine    whether the limits on releases can be met. Releases to the aquatic pathways    are similarly monitored. Radioactive materials in the liquid effluents are processed    in radioactive waste treatment systems (Section 2.2.4). The major radionuclides    released to the aquatic systems are tritium, isotopes of cobalt, and cesium.   When an individual is exposed through one of these pathways, the dose is determined    in part by the exposure time, and in part by the amount of time that the radioactivity    inhaled or ingested is retained in the individual's body. The major exposure    pathways include the following:       inhalation of contaminated air,     drinking milk or eating meat from animals that graze on open pasture on      which radioactive contamination may be deposited,     eating vegetables grown near the site, and      drinking (untreated) water or eating fish caught near the point of discharge      of liquid effluents.     Other less important exposure pathways include external irradiation from surface    deposition; consumption of animals that drink irrigation water that may contain    liquid effluents; consumption of crops grown near the site using irrigation    water that may contain liquid effluents; shoreline, boating, and swimming activities;    and direct off-site irradiation from radiation coming from the plant.   Radiation doses to the public are calculated in two ways. The first is for    the maximally exposed person (that is, the real or hypothetical individual potentially    subject to maximum exposure). The second is for average individual and population    doses. Doses are calculated using site-specific data where available. For those    cases in which site-specific data are not readily available, conservative (overestimating)    assumptions are used to estimate doses to the public.   2.3.7.3 Solid Waste   Both nonradioactive and radioactive wastes are generated at nuclear power plants.    The nonradioactive waste is generally not of concern unless it is classified    as Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) waste. All waste that is hazardous,    that is, classified as RCRA waste, is packaged and disposed of in a licensed    landfill consistent with the provisions of RCRA.   Hazardous chemicals, properly handled and controlled, do not present a major    health risk to personnel at nuclear power plants, but they must be understood    and treated carefully. Hazardous chemicals may be encountered in the work environment    during adjustments to the chemistry of the primary and secondary coolant systems,    during biocide application for fouling of heat removal equipment, during repair    and replacement of equipment containing hazardous oils or other chemicals, in    solvent cleaning, and in the repair of equipment. Exposures to hazardous chemicals    are minimized by observing good industrial hygiene practices. Disposal of essentially    all of the hazardous chemicals used at nuclear power plants is regulated by    RCRA or NPDES permits.   Solid radioactive waste consists of LLW, mixed waste, and spent fuel. LLW is    generated by removal of radionuclides from liquid waste streams, filtration    of airborne gaseous emissions, and removal of contaminated material from the    reactor environment.   Mixed waste is LLW that contains chemically hazardous components as defined    under RCRA. Mixed waste consists primarily of decontamination wastes and ion    exchange resins. The volume of mixed wastes produced at nuclear power plants    is typically a small fraction of their overall waste stream, accounting for    less than 3 percent by volume of the annual LLW discharged.   Spent fuel is produced during reactor operations. The buildup of fission products    and actinides during normal operation prevents the continued use of the fuel    assembly. Spent fuel is stored at the reactor site. Uncertainty exists as to    when an MRS or permanent spent-fuel repository may become available. However,    NRC has examined this issue and determined that licensees may, without significant    impact on the environment, store spent fuel on-site for 80 years after ceasing    reactor operation (55 FR 38474).    Four major considerations must be addressed when managing solid radioactive    waste: (1) the adequacy of interim storage on-site in lieu of permanent off-site    disposal, (2) transport of the radiological wastes to disposal sites over the    nation's highways and railways, (3) worker and public radiation exposure resulting    from handling and processing operations and transportation, and (4) final    disposal.   LLW is normally temporarily stored on-site before being shipped to licensed    LLW disposal facilities. Previously these facilities were at Barnwell, South    Carolina; Beatty, Nevada; and Hanford, Washington. Under the Low Level Radioactive    Waste Policy Act of 1980 and the LLRWPAA of 1985, states must secure their own    disposal capacity for LLW generated within their boundaries after 1992 by forming    waste compacts that are responsible for siting regional disposal facilities,    or by siting their own disposal facilities.   For disposal purposes, mixed waste is principally regulated by NRC (10 CFR Part    61). Although the LLRWPAA of 1985 required states to certify they are capable    of providing storage and disposal of mixed wastes in an NRC/EPA-licensed facility    by 1992, there are currently no licensed disposal facilities accepting commercially    generated mixed waste. Because these facilities are not yet available, mixed    waste is currently stored on-site.   Originally, disposal of spent fuel in a deep-geological repository was contemplated.    However, because of delays in siting a permanent repository on the part of the    Department of Energy and delays in developing an interim MRS facility, as required    by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, nuclear power plants are storing their    spent fuel on-site.   LLW is compacted and packaged, typically in 55-gal drums, then transported    via truck or railcar. The packaging and transportation of both LLW and mixed    waste must comply with EPA requirements. NRC specifications for reviewing the    environmental effects of the transport of spent fuel are contained in the  Table    S-4  Rule (54 FR 187; 10 CFR Part 51.52). States and communities along transportation    corridors may impose additional restrictions on the transport of nuclear waste.   Workers receive radiation exposure during the storage and handling of radioactive    waste and during the inspection of stored radioactive waste. However, this source    of exposure is small compared with other sources of exposure at operating nuclear    plants. Members of the general public are also exposed when the LLW is shipped    to a disposal site. No other type of radioactive waste is currently being transported    from the reactor sites. The public radiation exposures from radioactive material    transportation have been addressed rically in  Table    S-4  of 10 CFR Part 51.  Table    S-4  indicates that the cumulative dose to the exposed public from the transport    of both LLW and spent fuel is estimated to be about 0.03 person-sievert (3 person-rem)    per reactor year.   2.3.8 Socioeconomic Factors   2.3.8.1 Work Force   Although the size of the work force varies considerably among U.S. nuclear    power plants, the on-site staff responsible for operational activities generally    consists of 600 to 800 personnel per reactor unit. The average permanent staff    size at a nuclear power plant site ranges from 800 to 2400 people, depending    on the number of operating reactors at the site. In rural or low population    communities, this number of permanent jobs can provide employment for a substantial    portion of the local work force. Table 2.3 depicts mean employment during    normal operations in the 1975-1990 period, grouped by the number of reactors.   In addition to the work force needed for normal operations, many nonpermanent    personnel are required for various tasks that occur during outages, for example,    refueling outages, ISIs, or major refurbishments. Between 200 and 900 additional    workers may be employed during these outages to perform the normal outage maintenance    work. These are work force personnel who will be in the local community only    a short time, but during these periods of extensive maintenance activities,    the additional personnel will have a substantial effect on the locality. Table 2.4    indicates the levels of additional personnel typically required for different    types of outages.   A substantial portion of the regular plant work force is normally involved    in many of the efforts listed in Table 2.4, supplemented as needed by contractor    personnel for support during specialized projects. Peak crew sizes are greatly    affected by the specific requirements at each plant, utility decisions to make    major repairs to systems and components to improve or sustain plant performance,    and the relative phasing (schedule overlap) of these activities. Exact crew    sizes can, therefore, vary widely from plant to plant.   2.3.8.2 Community   Typically, the immediate environment in which a nuclear power plant is located    is rural, but the population density of the larger area surrounding the plant    and the distance from a medium- or large-sized metropolitan center varies substantially    across sites. Most sites, however, are not extremely remote [i.e., not more    than about 30 km (20 miles) from a community of 25,000 or 80 km (50 miles)    from a community of 100,000]. The significance of any given nuclear power plant    to its host area will depend to a large degree on its location, with the effects    generally being most concentrated in those communities closest to the plant. Major influences on the local communities include the    plant's effects on employment, taxes, housing, off-site land use, economic structure,    and public services.               Table 2.3 Changes in mean operations-period        employment at nuclear power plants over time                Operations period       One-unit plants a       Two-unit plants a       Three-unit plants a                Current b       832 (34)       1247 (28)       2404 (4)                1985-1989       841 (30)       1094 (26)       2095 (4)                1980-1984       447 (19)       946 (21)       1078 (3)                1975-1979       233 (17)       515 (16)       699 (3)         a Number in parentheses indicates        number of plants providing data.        b Approximately half the respondents reported data        for 1989 and half for 1990.                       Table 2.4 Mean additional employment          per reactor unit associated with three outage types at nuclear power plants                      Outage type a         Number of workers                      Typical planned (58)         783                      In-service inspection (23)         734                      Largest single (45)         1148                  a Number in parentheses indicates          number of plants providing data for the survey (NUMARC).     As noted in Section 2.3.8.1, the average nuclear power plant directly employs    800 to 2400 people. Many hundreds of additional jobs are provided through plant    subcontractors and service industries in the area. In rural communities, industries    that provide this number of jobs at relatively high wages are major contributors    to the local economy. In addition to the beneficial effect of the jobs that    are created, local plant purchasing and worker spending can generate considerable    income for local businesses.   Nuclear power plants represent an investment of several billion dollars. Such    an asset on the tax rolls is extraordinary for rural communities and can constitute    the major source of local revenues for small or remote taxing jurisdictions.    Often, this revenue can allow local communities to provide higher quality and    more extensive public services with lower tax rates. In general, capital expenditures    and large changes in public services are seldom necessitated by the presence    of the plant and its operating workers, particularly after local communities    have adapted to greater and more dynamic changes experienced during plant construction.   As this discussion indicates, nuclear power plants can have a significant positive    effect on their community environment. These effects are stable and long term.    Because these socioeconomic effects generally enhance the economic structure    of the local community, nuclear power plants are accepted by the community,    and indeed, become a major positive contributor to the local environs.       2.4 License Renewal--The Proposed Federal Action       [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents  ]   This section provides a brief overview of the most significant requirements    of the proposed revision to 10 CFR Part 54, ""Nuclear Power Plant License Renewal""    (FR 59, no. 174, p. 46574).   Under the license renewal rule (10 CFR Part 54), nuclear power plant    licensees would be allowed to operate their plants for a maximum of 20 years    past the terms of their original 40-year operating licenses provided that certain    requirements are met (Section 1.1). The rule requires licensees submitting    license renewal applications to perform specified types of evaluations and assessments    of their facilities, and to provide sufficient information for the NRC to determine    whether continued operation of the facility during the renewal term would endanger    public safety or the environment.   License renewal will be based on ensuring plant compliance with its current    licensing basis (i.e., the original plant licensing basis as amended during    the initial license term). In addition, licensees will be required to demonstrate    for certain important systems, structures, and components (SSCs) that the effects    of aging will be managed in the renewal period in a manner so that the important    functions of these SSCs will be maintained. The SSCs of concern in the renewal    period are those which traditionally do not have readily monitorable performance    or condition characteristics and include most passive, long-lived plant SSCs.    Therefore, the NRC's license renewal rule requires a systematic review of, at    least, passive, long-lived SSCs that support safety or other critical functions    of a nuclear power plant (as delineated in the rule). To make these determinations    regarding these SSCs, it is expected that licensees will implement aging management    activities for SSCs for which current programs may not be adequate to ensure    continued functionality in the renewal term. These aging management activities    are expected to include surveillance, on-line monitoring, inspections, testing,    trending, repair, refurbishment, replacement, and recordkeeping, as appropriate.   The license renewal rule seeks to ensure that the effects of aging in the period    of extended operation are adequately managed. The rule allows credit for existing    programs and regulatory requirements that continue to be applicable in the period    of extended operation and that provide adequate management of the effects of    aging for SSCs. This provision includes credit for rules or requirements, such    as those incorporated in the maintenance rule, which could impact license renewal    activities performed to detect and mitigate age-related functionality degradation.   The rule requires an integrated plant assessment (IPA). License renewal applicants    must perform an IPA to determine which SSCs will be subject to additional review.    The IPA would then determine whether additional programs, over and above the    current operational and maintenance programs, are required to manage the effects    of aging so that equipment function is maintained.   In addition, the license renewal rule requires licensees submitting an application    for license renewal to provide the following:       information noting any changes in the current licensing basis that occur      during NRC's review of the submittal; and     an evaluation of time-limited aging analyses (i.e., issues such as fatigue,      equipment qualification, and reactor-vessel neutron embrittlement which have      inherent time limits associated with them).     Key aspects of 10 CFR Part 54 could result in environmental impacts because    of the requirements imposed. These key aspects are (1) the enhanced surveillance,    on-line monitoring, inspections, testing, trending, and recordkeeping (SMITTR)    on SSCs identified in the IPA and (2) the resulting actions taken to ensure    that aging would be effectively managed and that the functionality of these    SSCs would be maintained throughout the term that the new license would be in    effect.   Note that the license renewal rule does not require any specific repairs, refurbishments,    or modifications to nuclear facilities, but only that appropriate actions be    taken to ensure the continued functionality of SSCs in the scope of the rule.         2.5 Baseline Environmental Impact Initiators Associated    with Continued Operation of Nuclear Power Plants      [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents  ]    The previous sections identified the various types of environmental impacts    associated with current nuclear power plant operation. Before discussing incremental    impacts associated with license renewal, it is useful to first establish a baseline    from which to evaluate incremental effects. This baseline is provided by current    experience with nuclear power plant operation and the related interactions with    the environment. This section presents quantitative information on selected    environmental ""impact initiators."" The term ""impact initiators"" is defined,    followed by estimates of the quantities of each initiator currently generated    by typical nuclear power plant operation.   2.5.1 Definition of Environmental Impact Initiators   The terms ""environmental impact initiators"" and ""impact initiators"" as used    here refer to the precursors to possible environmental impacts. For example,    the incremental work force needed to accomplish license renewal activities is    not an environmental impact, but the associated effects on housing, transportation,    schools, etc., are environmental or socioeconomic impacts. The environmental    impact initiators that need to be quantified to estimate overall environmental    effects resulting from license renewal are as follows:       Labor hours and work force size associated with on-site craft workers, engineering      and administrative personnel, and health physics personnel are needed to estimate      socioeconomic impacts to communities affected by personnel employed temporarily      at nuclear plants.     Labor costs are used to estimate both economic impacts to affected communities      and economic viability of extended plant operation through license renewal.     Occupational radiation exposure is used to estimate radiation-related impacts      to workers.     Capital costs of hardware, materials, and equipment are used both to estimate      tax-base-related impacts to affected communities and to provide information      related to the overall economics of license renewal.     Radioactive waste types, volumes, and disposal costs are used to estimate      environmental impacts related to the disposal of such wastes.     These impact initiators are the key elements expected to change, relative to    current nuclear plant operation, as a result of actions taken to support license    renewal. Other environmental considerations, including water usage, land usage,    chemical usage/discharges, and air quality, are not anticipated to change significantly    as a result of license renewal activities.   The impact initiators assessed--labor force, labor costs, capital costs, occupational    radiation exposure, and radioactive waste volumes--help determine most of the    potential changes in environmental impacts resulting from license renewal. For    example, estimates of refurbishment labor and capital cost, together with a    description of the types of refurbishment activities that might be undertaken,    help define potential environmental impacts related to refurbishment period    land use, water use, air quality, socioeconomics, nonradiological solid wastes,    etc. The impact initiators assessed form a sufficient set from which to assess    most license renewal-related environmental impacts. Also, the focus is on changes    in impact initiators originating from plant activities, as opposed to changes    in the plant environs or receptors (e.g., changes in the population affected    by the plant).    2.5.2 Baseline Environmental Impact Initiator Estimates   The following discussions provide estimates of the baseline quantities for    each of the foregoing impact initiators. These baseline quantities are typical    of current nuclear plant operation.   2.5.2.1 Baseline Work Force Size and Expenditures for Labor   Table 2.3 indicates that the current work force at nuclear plant sites is typically    in the range of 830 to 2400 permanent staff, depending on the number of operating    reactors at a site. On-site personnel responsible for operational activities    generally number between 600 and 800 per reactor unit. The average number of    permanent staff per reactor unit is estimated to be about 700 people, and this    number is approximately the same for both BWRs and PWRs. Assuming a normal 40-hour    work week for most on-site staff, this staffing translates into an annual labor    effort of about 1.5 million labor hours per unit. The permanent staff is augmented    by temporary workers called in to assist with outage activities and special    projects. The associated expenditures for labor, including an allowance of roughly    20 percent for temporary staff to support outages and special projects,    is estimated to be about $77,000,000 annually per unit.   2.5.2.2 Baseline Capital Expenditures   Nuclear power plants incur expenditures for three major types of capital additions.    There are (1) major plant retrofits needed to satisfy NRC requirements    to ensure safe plant operation (e.g., changes required as a result of resolution    of a generic safety issue), (2) major repairs needed to keep the plant operational    (such as main turbine-generator repairs), and (3) discretionary activities undertaken    to improve plant performance and labor productivity (DOE/EIA-0547). Expenditures    for capital additions have varied widely from plant to plant and from one year    to another. In 1989, the average expenditure for capital additions was about    $24 per kilowatt, or roughly $24 million for a 1000-MW(e) plant (1989 dollars).    These expenditures equate to about $28 million per year per 1000-MW(e) plant    in 1994 dollars.   2.5.2.3 Baseline Occupational Radiation Exposure   Occupational radiation exposures vary considerably from plant to plant and    from year to year at a given plant. The long-term trends indicate that overall    worker exposure has been decreasing on a per-plant basis. The average occupational    exposure for the year 1989 was roughly 4.4 person-sievert (440 person-rem)    per plant at BWRs and about 3 person-sievert (300 person-rem) per plant at PWRs.    For the years 1991 to 1993, the average exposure for all U.S. nuclear plants    was about 2.5 person-sievert (250 person-rem) per plant (NUREG-1350, v.6). Significant    deviations from these averages are routinely experienced, depending largely    on whether a given plant had an outage during a given year and the nature and    extent of refurbishment or repair activities undertaken during outages.   2.5.2.4 Baseline Radioactive Waste Generation   Section 2.2.4.3 discussed the different types of radioactive wastes typically    generated at nuclear power plants. The type of waste generated in the greatest    volumes is LLW. The volume of LLW disposed of annually has shown a decreasing    trend over the past several years. Most recently, the amount of LLW disposed    of at PWRs has been about 250 m 3 /year (8800 ft 3 /year);    in contrast, the amount disposed of at BWRs has been about 560 m 3 /year    (19,700 ft 3 /year).   Small volumes of mixed wastes are also generated by nuclear plant operation.    However, any such waste that cannot be treated to eliminate the chemical hazards    is currently stored on-site at the nuclear plants and not shipped for disposal.   U.S. reactors generate high-level wastes, primarily in the form of spent fuel.    The quantities of spent fuel generated on a per-reactor-year basis is not expected    to change with license renewal.       2.6 Environmental Impact Initiators Associated with License    Renewal and Continued Operation      [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents  ]   2.6.1 Scope and Objectives of Section 2.6   A major objective of the GEIS is to support the proposed changes to 10 CFR Part    51 by defining the issues that need to be addressed by the NRC and the applicants    in plant-specific license renewal proceedings. First, the environmental issues    are defined by characterizing and evaluating the actions and activities that    may be undertaken by licensees in pursuit of license renewal and extended plant    life. These actions and activities are then used to characterize their associated    potential environmental impacts.    This section discusses potential actions nuclear power plant licensees may    undertake to achieve license renewal and an extended plant life. This section    also estimates the extent of the environmental initiators associated with these    actions during license renewal and the extended term of operation.    The preceding section noted that the license renewal rule requires that the    functionality of important SSCs be maintained throughout the period of the renewed    license. To provide this assurance, licensees will likely undertake enhanced    SMITTR activities on SSCs identified in the IPA and, based on the findings of    these efforts, take appropriate action to ensure that aging is effectively managed    and that the functionality of these SSCs is maintained. Incremental repair,    refurbishment, and/or replacement of SSCs, as well as related changes to plant    operations and maintenance, may be performed to ensure that this objective is    achieved. These actions, either directly or indirectly, will produce incremental    impacts to the local environment. These incremental effects are over and above    those expected if plants were simply to continue to operate as at present.   Licensees may also choose to undertake various refurbishment and upgrade activities    at their nuclear facilities to better maintain or improve reliability, performance,    and economics of power plant operation during the extended period of operation.    These are activities which would be performed at the option of the licensee    and which are in addition to those performed to satisfy the license renewal    rule requirements.   The set of activities undertaken is expected to vary widely from plant to plant.    Some plants may require little refurbishment and upgrading. Other plants may    require considerable refurbishment and upgrading. For purposes of the GEIS,    two types of license renewal programs were considered for which the environmental    impact initiators were developed:       a ""typical"" or ""mid-stream"" license renewal program, intended to be representative      of the type of program that many plants seeking license renewal might implement,      and     a ""conservative"" or ""bounding"" program encompassing considerably more activities      by licensees, intended to characterize an upper bound, or near upper bound,      of the impacts that could be generated at a nuclear power plant.      Each program applies to both BWRs and PWRs. Thus, there are four separate cases    or scenarios considered: a typical BWR, an upper bound or conservative BWR,    a typical PWR, and a conservative PWR.   The typical scenarios can be used to estimate environmental impacts from an    ""average"" license renewal program and to estimate the nationwide impacts of    the total nuclear power plant population. The bounding license renewal scenarios,    being much more conservative, are intended to address what might occur for those    plants whose impacts will be considerably greater than is typical of the nuclear    power reactor population as a whole.   Section 2.6.2 presents the bases and assumptions used in developing the different    license renewal scenarios. Section 2.6.3 describes and characterizes the    typical license renewal scenarios and the resulting environmental impact initiators.    The conservative scenario program is described in Section 2.6.4.      2.6.2 Bases, Assumptions, and Approach      2.6.2.1 Structures, Systems, and Components of Interest   The SSCs of interest for assessing license renewal-related environmental impacts    are those that are critical to the safe operation of the plant and that traditionally    do not have readily monitorable performance characteristics, which means that    the effects of aging may go undetected and lead to the loss of SSC functionality.    Many structures and components in currently-licensed LWRs are subject to programs    such as the maintenance rule, periodic surveillances, and periodic replacement    and refurbishment and have readily monitorable performance or condition characteristics    so that these programs can reveal the effects of aging in sufficient time to    prevent loss of SSC functionality. However, many other nuclear plant components,    such as passive, long-lived structures and components, may not be subject to    programs which reveal the effects of aging in sufficient time to ensure their    functionality. Therefore, these passive, long-lived structures and components    are the items that may need new or incremental aging management activities.    The SSCs used in the current evaluation are discussed in Sections 2.6.3.1 and    2.6.4.1 for the typical and conservative programs, respectively.   2.6.2.2 Definition of Candidate Aging Management Activities   A comprehensive list of possible license renewal-related activities with potential    environmental impacts was developed. Emphasis was placed on defining those activities    clearly associated with license renewal, that is, those activities which would    not be included in a continuation or extrapolation of the activities that occurred    during the original licensing term. The types of activities considered ranged    from enhanced inspection programs to component replacement. In turn, the potential    environmental impacts of each identified activity were examined and analyzed.     Following the identification of candidate SSCs and the related aging management    activities for each of the different license renewal programs, quantitative    estimates of potential environmental impact initiators were developed. The estimates    apply to a particular approach to aging management.   The data needed to characterize aging management activities were developed    in the context of the four major license renewal programs previously identified:    a typical BWR, a conservative BWR, a typical PWR, and a conservative PWR. Each    program consisted of the following:       lists of SSCs for which incremental activities would be performed to ensure      that safe and economical operation could be achieved throughout the extended      life of the plant;     lists of the activities performed on each SSC to manage aging;     the number of times each activity would be performed, accounting for repetitive      actions on individual SSCs and the number of similar items in the plant subject      to these activities; and     the specific times during which each activity is performed.     The generic license renewal programs utilized in this evaluation were based    on similar schedules for carrying out the selected aging management activities.    Any major refurbishment work called for by the programs was assumed to start    shortly after a renewed license had been granted. In these example programs,    this would occur in roughly year 30 of the original 40-year license term. This    work was assumed to be completed over several successive outages, including    one at the end of the 40th year of plant operation. Incremental SMITTR actions,    and the installation of enhanced or additional surveillance and monitoring equipment    and systems, were also assumed to be initiated at this time. The SMITTR actions    continue throughout the remaining life of the plants. This is true for both    the typical and conservative case scenarios.   2.6.2.3 Incremental Effects Only   All aging management programs of interest to the current effort deliberately    omit, to the extent possible, current practice as it has evolved and is expected    to evolve in the license renewal period. The programs also exclude any changes    in the basic design or technology of the plant. Rather, they include only those    activities that would constitute a discrete change in the plant's operation    and maintenance program and would be implemented only after issuance of the    renewal license. In particular, all normal repair activities, as well as any    activities undertaken to satisfy recently enacted requirements such as the Maintenance    Rule, are considered to fall within the scope of current practice and were excluded    from consideration. Therefore, the impact initiators considered here are incremental    to those resulting from the extension of current practice.   2.6.2.4 Reference Plant Size and Characteristics   All assessments presented here reflect design features and quantities consistent    with 1000-MW(e) plant designs. For the PWRs, the features and sizing chosen    were consistent with those for a four-loop Westinghouse plant design with a    large dry containment. The BWR features used were representative of designs    utilizing internal jet pumps and two recirculation loops. Mark III containment    features were used.   2.6.2.5 Reference SMITTR Program   The generic BWR and PWR aging management programs used in the present evaluations    for both the typical and conservative scenarios were based on the safety-centered    SMITTR programs that were used in the regulatory analysis for 10 CFR Part    54 (NUREG-1362). These basic SMITTR programs were supplemented by activities    planned for the Lead Plant programs (Sciacca 1/3/93 and Sciacca 1/13/93). In    addition, the aging management programs used as the basis for the current impact    initiator estimates included actions anticipated for non-safety-related systems    and equipment, but which licensees may undertake to maintain or enhance plant    availability and performance. The conservative case scenarios, in particular,    assumed considerable expansion of the basic Part 54 programs to include actions    on many balance-of-plant SSCs. The inclusion of activities directed toward non-safety-related    SSCs considerably expanded the number of times given activities would be performed    and significantly increased the variety of activities performed, compared with    those considered for the 10 CFR Part 54 Regulatory Analysis. The inclusion of    aging management activities beyond those characterized for safety-centered SMITTR    programs enhances the comprehensiveness and conservatism of the estimates used    in the preparation of the GEIS conservative cases. The typical license renewal    program scenarios also include more SMITTR actions than those used for the 10 CFR Part    54 assessments, but to a lesser degree than the conservative case scenarios.    The typical program SMITTR activities incremental to those anticipated under    Part 54 were included to allow for voluntary actions on the part of licensees    to better manage aging of balance-of-plant SSCs. All typical program activities    were reviewed for possible overlap with the Maintenance Rule activities; any    activities perceived to fall within the scope of the Maintenance Rule or other    rules were eliminated from the programs.   2.6.2.6 Major Refurbishments and Replacements   The major refurbishment/replacement class of activities included in the license    renewal programs characterized here is intended to encompass actions which typically    take place only once in the life of a nuclear plant, if at all. Replacement    of BWR recirculation piping and PWR steam generators falls into this category    of activities. Many such activities were included in the conservative case license    renewal scenarios. The items making up this category include both activities    which have already been performed at some operating LWRs and activities which    have not yet been performed, at least not to the extent assumed for the purpose    of defining potential environmental impacts. The inclusion of activities which    have already been performed on some existing nuclear plants is based on the    premise that there are certain plants in the reactor population that will not    have to perform these activities during the current license term, but that would    elect to perform these major activities to enable safe and economic operation    for the incremental term allowed with license renewal. In addition, major refurbishment    activities included in these example license renewal programs encompass all    areas of a nuclear power plant (e.g., structures, mechanical and electrical    systems, fluid systems). This approach further ensures that the impacts characterized    for the conservative case scenarios have a high probability of bounding the    impacts likely to accrue to any individual plant seeking license renewal and    extended plant operation.   The typical scenarios, in contrast, included fewer major refurbishment activities    of this type. For these scenarios the assumption was made that most plants will    have ongoing effective maintenance and refurbishment programs that preclude    the need for refurbishment/replacement of all but a few components and structures.   2.6.2.7 Prototypic License Renewal Schedule   Figure 2.3  shows representative timelines for the    license renewal process of a nuclear plant. The timelines shown were judged    to be reasonable by the NRC staff. The schedule is applicable to both the typical    and conservative license renewal scenarios. The upper timeline shows the relationship    of the new license period to the initial license period. The lower line indicates    the various outage types and their assumed timing over the period covered by    a renewed license. The key underlying assumption for the timelines is that the    licensee should be assured by the NRC 10 years before the expiration of    its current operating license that the plant in question is suitable for license    renewal. These 10 years are required for the licensee to arrange for alternative    sources of power should a renewed license not be granted. The license renewal    process is presumed to start with the licensee initiating a number of studies    and analyses to support the license renewal application 3 years before    submitting the application to the NRC. The NRC would then perform a detailed    review of the application and, in the successful cases, issue a new license    (with conditions) within 2 years after the application is received. The    new license would go into effect at that point, covering the balance of the    original 40-year term, as well as the additional 20-year term.   It was assumed that licensees would initiate incremental aging detection and    management activities as soon as the new license was granted, as called for    by 10 CFR Part 54. Discretionary major refurbishment activities might also    be undertaken early into the license renewal term.   2.6.2.8 Schedule for Performing Major Refurbishment Activities   The reference schedule assumes that major refurbishment activities associated    with    Figure 2.3  License renewal schedule and outage periods    considered for environmental impact initiator definition.   license renewal are started shortly after the new license is granted, and that    these are accomplished over several successive outages. They are completed by    the time the plant completes its 40th year of operation, which is about    10 years into the new license term. The schedule for performing any major refurbishment    activities will undoubtedly be highly plant specific, and such activities could    well be spread throughout the term of the renewed license. Earlier timing of    these activities provides the utilities with more time to recover the cost of    the investment through the sale of energy produced. Thus, the schedules utilized    for the present evaluations are reasonable, but alternative schedules are also    possible.   The schedules utilized were similar for both the BWR and PWR programs. However,    the typical programs have little need for an extended outage because the extent    of major refurbishment activities is relatively modest. The ""major refurbishment    outage"" duration for the typical programs was reduced compared with that deemed    necessary for the conservative case scenarios.   2.6.2.9 Outage Types and Durations   Activities carried out in support of license renewal and extended plant life    were assumed to be performed primarily during selected outages. Five types of    outages were used: normal refuelings, 5-year ISI outages, 10-year ISI outages,    current term refurbishment outages, and major refurbishment outages.  Figure 2.3     illustrates when these outages are assumed to occur. The current term outages    fall within the 40-year period initially covered by the plant's current license,    but with license renewal they occur during the period covered by the new license.   Outage types and durations were established to allow estimation of the rates    at which environmental impacts might be generated as a result of license renewal    activities. For example, the number of workers required at a site for a given    outage is dependent on the amount of work to be performed (labor hours), the    time available to accomplish the work, and the number of labor hours expended    per person-week or person-day. The number of workers so identified, in turn,    allows estimation of potential socioeconomic and other impacts to affected communities.   Table 2.5 summarizes the different outage types and durations for both reactor    types and for both the typical and conservative license renewal scenarios. Additional    discussion of the basis used in selecting outage durations is provided in Appendix B.   2.6.3 Typical License Renewal Scenario   The characteristics of the typical license renewal program are discussed briefly    in Section 2.6.3.1. Listings of the SSCs likely to be subject to incremental    aging management activities are provided. Listings of the types of SMITTR actions    and major refurbishment activities that may be performed as part of a typical    license renewal program are reviewed and discussed in Appendix B. Section    2.6.3.2 summarizes the impact initiator quantities expected to be generated    by such a program. Section 2.6.3.2 compares the impact initiator quantities    for the typical program scenarios with the impactor initiator quantities currently    produced from routine reactor operation.   2.6.3.1 Characterization of Typical License Renewal Programs   The characterization of license renewal programs required that three key types    of information be developed: (1) identification of the SSCs likely to be    subject to incremental aging management activities, (2) candidate lists of the    activities to be performed on these systems and components to suitably manage    aging effects that could have potential environmental consequences, and (3) identification    of environmental attributes (impact initiators) associated with those activities.    The typical programs are intended to be representative of the typical or ""average""    plant's activities in support of license renewal. However, the typical programs    are still somewhat conservative; that is, some plants will not require all of    the actions identified in the typical programs. The typical license renewal    scenarios were based on the following.       The Monticello and Yankee Rowe lead plant life extension (PLEX) programs      were carefully reviewed. Activities included in either program were, with      some exceptions, incorporated into the typical license renewal scenarios.      The information obtained from the lead plants was also used to establish both      the numbers of SSCs subject to a given activity and the schedule for performing      such activities.     All activities included in the Part 54 Regulatory Analysis which were pertinent      to passive, long-lived SSCs and which were not likely to be implemented because      of other rules or regulations were retained as incremental actions. The Part      54 activities were retained both to maintain consistency with the updated      Part 54 Regulatory Analysis and to allow for a modest amount of conservatism      in the typical scenarios.     As noted previously, recently enacted rules and regulations, in particular      the Maintenance Rule, were taken into account in developing typical license      renewal or PLEX-related activities.     Surveys were made to help establish the likelihood that certain major activities      would be performed by typical licensees seeking license renewal. In particular,      assessments were made relative to steam     generator replacement and reactor vessel annealing for PWRs, and for recirculation    piping replacement for BWRs. These assessments reviewed the fraction of the    affected reactor population that has already performed these refurbishment/replacement    activities and ascertained whether such activities might need to be repeated    for extended plant life. Based on the results of these reviews, it was assumed    that typical license renewal programs will not need to include many such major    activities.                      Table 2.5 Outage duration summary                                Outage duration (months)                      Outage type         Conservative         Typical                      Refueling         2         2                      5-Year in-service inspection         3         3                      10-Year in-service inspection         4         3                      Current-term outage (refurbishment)         4         3                      Major refurbishment outage         9         4               Typical program structures, systems, and components subject to incremental    activities   Tables 2.6 and 2.7 list the SSCs used in the typical program evaluations for    which incremental activities are assumed to be onducted during license renewal    and extended life. Table 2.6 lists the items subject to incremental    SMITTR actions; Table 2.7 lists items subject to major refurbishment/replacement    activities. Table 2.6 includes SSCs subject to the addition of new    or improved condition monitoring systems, as well as those subject to incremental    SMITTR activities. Most of the items in these tables are common to both BWRs    and PWRs.   Although the specific numbers of components and design features may be different    for these two reactor types, they are similar enough that the environmental    impacts resulting from aging management activities on these items will be reasonably similar for both reactor types.  Differences in the numbers of like items employed in each plant design were taken into account in assessing impacts.

Potential impacts from aging management    activities on such items were treated separately for the two major plant categories.   Definition of aging management activities   The incremental aging management activities carried out to allow operation    of a nuclear power plant beyond the original 40-year license term will be from    one of two broad categories: (1) SMITTR actions, most of which are repeated    at regular intervals, and (2) major refurbishment or replacement actions,    which usually occur fairly infrequently and possibly only once in the life of    the plant for any given item.   Most of the SMITTR activities included in the present assessment were taken    from the Safety-Centered Aging Management program defined previously and utilized    for the 10 CFR Part 54 License Renewal Regulatory Analysis (NUREG-1362). However,    the current effort includes additional items and activities, because the previous    analysis focused only on SSCs important to safety, whereas for the current efforts    it has been assumed that licensees will also perform actions aimed at ensuring    reliable and efficient electrical power production. Thus, many balance-of-plant    SSCs are included here which were not included in the 10 CFR Part 54 evaluations.   In certain cases a SMITTR activity could involve replacement or refurbishment    of the SSC being addressed. Any such SMITTR replacement/refurbishment activities    for a particular item typically occur more than once in the extended life of    the plant.   Table B.1 of Appendix B lists the incremental SMITTR actions used as the basis    for estimating license renewal environmental impacts. It indicates the specific    aging detection and mitigation actions performed on each SSC of concern. These    activities include some which are undertaken only to improve reliability or    economic performance; thus, Table B.1 includes several active components    in addition to the passive, long-lived SSCs that are the focus of 10 CFR Part    54.   Table B.2 of Appendix B lists the major refurbishment or replacement activities    used to estimate environmental impacts. The table indicates the fractions or    portions of the SSCs involved which are subject to the stated actions. Unless    otherwise noted, 100 percent of an SSC was assumed to be replaced or refurbished.    As with the list of actions cited in Table B.1, the quantities assumed    were based in part on the information provided in the industry pilot and lead    plant studies and from reported existing industry experience on major refurbishments    (Sciacca 1/3/93 and 1/13/93). In other cases engineering judgment provided the    basis for the portions of the systems or structures being replaced or refurbished.    The extent of major refurbishments envisioned for typical license renewal programs    is fairly modest.   2.6.3.2 Typical Program Incremental Initiator Quantities   Table 2.8 summarizes the typical program impact initiator quantities resulting    from the incremental SMITTR and major refurbishment/replacement activities assumed    to be carried out in support of license renewal and extended plant life. Estimates    of the amounts generated are shown for each of the outage types previously discussed,    during which these impact initiators are expected to be generated from license    renewal activities. Separate estimates are provided for BWRs and PWRs. All figures    are shown on a per-plant basis (i.e., for a single nuclear plant).   A comparison of the figures shown in Table 2.8 with current reactor experience    as discussed in Section 2.5.2 indicates that, for the typical license renewal    scenario, incremental license renewal effects are expected to be relatively    modest. For example, with current nuclear plant operation, roughly 1.5 million    person-hours are expended each year for on-site operations and maintenance activities.    The incremental efforts associated with license renewal-related activities are    estimated to add between 500,000 and 700,000 person-hours for all such activities    over the remaining life of a typical plant. Thus, the license renewal activities would add roughly 20,000 person-hours per year, which is a small increment compared to the 1.5    million person-hours per year typical of current reactor operation.

Table 2.8 indicates that the number of additional on-site personnel needed    to accomplish license renewal-related activities is quite modest for most periods    when such activities will be performed. The exception is the major refurbishment    outage, when an average of between 200 and 400 additional personnel may be needed.    Note that these personnel are in addition to the 700- to 800-person temporary    work force typically called in to assist with current outages at nuclear power    plants (see Table 2.4). The estimates of additional personnel presented    in Table 2.8 are based on the assumption that the incremental work efforts    are spread uniformly over the entire duration of the associated outages. In    reality, some peaking of staffing requirements will occur during each outage.    Additional analyses were performed to evaluate the extent of such peaking, and    these analyses are discussed in Appendix B. For the typical BWR license renewal    scenario, these analyses indicated that the on-site temporary work force would    peak at about 1000 personnel. This peak occurs during the major refurbishment    outage, and it includes the temporary work force needed to accomplish refueling    and routine outage activities (e.g. routine maintenance and ISI activities)    as well as license renewal-related activities. For the PWR, the corresponding    temporary worker requirements reach a peak at about 900 additional staff. This    peak requirement occurs during the current term outages.   The incremental occupational radiation exposure estimated to accrue because    of license renewal activities is between 2.5 and 5 person-sievert (250 and 500    person-rem). On an annualized basis, this represents an increase in annual exposures    of about 3 to 4 percent relative to current reactor operation experience.   LLW generation resulting from license renewal activities is projected to be    between 185 and 220 m 3  (6,000 and 8,000 ft 3 ) of as-shipped    LLW over the remaining life of the plants. Currently, PWRs typically generate    about 250 m 3 /year (8800 ft 3 /year); the amount disposed    of at BWRs has been about 560 m 3 /year (19,700 ft 3 /year).    Thus, the amount of LLW expected to be added because of license renewal activities    is roughly the equivalent of one-half to one year's production of waste under    current operating conditions. This represents an increment over the remaining    life of the plants of about 1 to 3 percent relative to what would be produced    with continued present-basis plant operation.   Table 2.8 presents several types of costs associated with license renewal and    extended plant life. These include incremental costs associated with additional    labor, waste disposal, capital costs, and off-site costs (off-site engineering    and administrative support). For the typical BWR license renewal program, the    total incremental costs are estimated to be almost $110 million; those for the    typical PWR program are estimated to be about $90 million. Although these costs    will be incurred over the remaining life of a plant, more than half of these    costs might well be incurred in the first few years after a renewed license    is granted. For comparison purposes, recent non-fuel operations and maintenance    (O&M) costs at U.S. nuclear plants have averaged about $75 million    per year for a 1000-MW(e) plant, and capital additions have averaged about $28 million    per year (1994 dollars). Thus, the estimated labor and capital expenditures    associated with incremental license renewal activities over the remaining life    of a plant with a renewed license are the equivalent of roughly a year's expenditures    for O&M and capital additions currently experienced by LWRs, or less than    a 5 percent increase for such expenditures on an annualized basis.   2.6.4 Conservative License Renewal Scenario   The characteristics of the conservative case license renewal programs are discussed    briefly in Section 2.6.4.1. As was done in Section 2.6.3.1 for the typical    programs, listings are provided of the SSCs likely to be subject to incremental    aging management activities. Listings of the types of SMITTR actions and major    refurbishment activities that may be performed as part of a conservative license    renewal program are reviewed and discussed in Appendix B. Section 2.6.4.2 summarizes    the impact initiator quantities expected to be generated by such programs and    compares the impact initiator quantities for the conservative program scenarios    with the impactor initiator quantities currently produced in routine reactor    operation.   2.6.4.1 Characterization of the Conservative Program   The conservative license renewal scenarios are intended to capture what might    occur for those outlier plants whose impacts will be considerably greater than    what is typical of the reactor population as a whole. Because these conservative,    or bounding, programs are quite comprehensive, they subsume impacts from more    atypical plants.   The conservative case license renewal scenario uses a conservative basis for    projecting activities and impacts. The primary bases and assumptions are as    follows.       In contrast with the typical programs, the recently enacted rules and regulations,      in particular the Maintenance Rule, were not taken into account in revising      license renewal or PLEX-related activities. This simplified approach was taken      because accounting for such effects would have a negligible impact on the      estimates of environmental impact initiator quantities.      All activities included in the Part 54 Regulatory Analysis were retained      as incremental actions. In many instances, the number of SSCs subjected to      particular SMITTR activities was increased to reflect optional actions on      the part of licensees to better ensure reliable and economical service for      balance-of-plant systems and components.     The major refurbishment and replacement activities included in the programs      are quite expansive and encompass all aspects of the plant designs (e.g.,      structural, mechanical, and electrical). Similarly, the extent of such activities      for particular SSCs is considerable in most cases and is more extensive than      that anticipated for the average plant seeking license renewal.     As was previously noted, several of the major refurbishment activities included      in the present estimates have already occurred at many nuclear plants. These      are activities such as steam generator replacement in PWRs and recirculation      piping replacement in BWRs. These activities are included in the conservative      case scenarios to encompass those plants that must perform such activities      to achieve the desired extended plant life and efficiency, but that have not      already done so or that might have to repeat such actions.     License renewal program definition   Conservative program SSCs subject to incremental activities .    The conservative program SSCs assumed to be subject to incremental SMITTR activities    included all of the SSCs identified in Table 2.6 for the typical program.    In addition, the conservative program included the items listed in Table    2.9. The conservative program, in most instances, also included a greater number    of a given type of SSC subject to SMITTR actions than did the typical programs.    For example, the conservative programs included roughly twice the number of    motor-operated valves subject to incremental aging detection and mitigation    actions as did the typical programs. This approach was taken with the conservative    programs to encompass what might occur at outlier plants.   Both the SSCs subject to incremental SMITTR activities and those subject to    major refurbishment activities for the conservative program are more inclusive    than those included in the typical program scenarios. A comparison of Tables    2.6 and 2.7 with Tables 2.9 and 2.10 readily demonstrates the more comprehensive    nature of the conservative program compared with the typical program scenarios.

Table 2.10 lists items subject to major refurbishment/replacement activities.    Most of the items in these tables are common to both BWRs and PWRs.    Definition of conservative program aging management activities .    As for the typical programs, the incremental aging management activities carried    out for the conservative license renewal scenarios to allow operation beyond    the original 40-year license term will include both SMITTR activities and major    refurbishment activities.   The SMITTR activities associated with the conservative programs are quite similar    to those developed for the typical programs, except that they cover additional    types and numbers of SSCs. The scenarios developed for the conservative programs assumed that many balance-of-plant SSCs would be subject to license renewal-related activities to better ensure reliable and economical operation for the extended life of the plant.

Table B.1 of Appendix B lists the incremental SMITTR actions used as the basis    for estimating license renewal environmental impacts. It indicates the specific    aging detection and mitigation actions performed on each SSC of concern.   Table B.1 indicates the specific SMITTR activities included in each type of    program, but it does not indicate the number of SSCs subject to a particular    activity. The programs defined for the conservative case scenarios in all instances    match or exceed the number of SSCs included in the corresponding typical license    renewal programs.   The list of major replacement and refurbishment activities included here was    derived largely from areas of concern identified in the industry pilot and lead    NP-5181M, EPRI NP-5289P, EPRI NP-5002). This is true for both the conservative    and typical scenarios. Those studies did not necessarily indicate that all of    the items addressed should be replaced or undergo major overhauls. However,    for all items addressed, there was sufficient concern over their long-term integrity    that investigators thought, as a minimum, that additional analysis was warranted.   Although replacement may not have been indicated for the pilot and lead plants,    at least a few plants may well face extensive actions of this type to ensure    safe and economical operation throughout the renewal term. Therefore, regardless    of the specific determinations for the pilot and lead plants, the SSCs of concern    identified in those studies form a representative list of candidate items for    inclusion in major replacement and refurbishment actions for outlier plants,    and thus for the conservative scenarios. Other items included in this list were    drawn from actions that have already occurred at one or several operating power    plants. BWR recirculation piping replacement and PWR steam generator replacement    fall into this category. Although many plants will undertake the replacement    of such items during the current license term, there may be other plants which    would undertake such tasks only to allow for extended plant operation. Inclusion    of these activities in the conservative scenario evaluations provides for an    upper bound estimate of what at least a few plants may undertake for license    renewal.   Table B.2 of Appendix B lists the major refurbishment or replacement activities    used to estimate environmental impacts for the conservative case scenarios.    Unless otherwise noted, 100 percent of an SSC was assumed to be replaced    or refurbished.   2.6.4.2 Conservative Program Incremental Initiator Quantities   Table 2.11 summarizes the conservative program impact initiator quantities    resulting from the incremental SMITTR and major refurbishment/replacement activities    assumed to be carried out in support of license renewal and extended plant life.    A comparison with the estimates provided for the typical programs (Table 2.8)    indicates that the conservative program scenario estimates of impact initiator    quantities are factors of four to six greater than those for the typical programs.    The type of information provided in Table 2.11 is identical to that provided    in Table 2.8. Separate estimates are provided for BWRs and PWRs, and all    figures are shown on a per-plant basis.

A comparison of the figures shown in Table 2.11 with current reactor experience    as discussed in Section 2.5.2 indicates that, for the conservative license renewal    scenario, incremental license renewal effects are expected to be fairly significant.    The incremental efforts associated with license renewal-related activities are    estimated to add between 5 million and 7 million person-hours for all such activities    over the remaining life of a conservative plant. These increments for license    renewal can be compared with the roughly 1.5 million person-hours expended annually    with current reactor operation.    If the license renewal efforts were uniformly spread over the 30-year period    that a renewed license would be in effect, they would increase annual labor    requirements by 10 to 15 percent. The effect of the incremental license renewal    labor will be even more significant for certain periods. For example, the number    of additional workers needed to accomplish the major refurbishment activities    during the major refurbishment outage could potentially double or triple the    number needed during a normally scheduled outage. The projected number of additional    workers needed for the BWR major refurbishment outage is almost 900, averaged    over the entire outage. For certain periods during this outage, the number of    additional workers is estimated to be about 1200. For the PWR, the outage average    increment in additional personnel needed for the major refurbishment outage    is about 1700, and the number is expected to peak at about 2300 for certain    periods during this outage. Note that these estimates of peak incremental personnel    include the 700- to 800-person temporary work force typically called in to assist    with current outages at nuclear power plants (see Table 2.4). Appendix    B provides additional discussion of license renewal-related incremental staffing    requirements.   The overall occupational radiation exposure estimated to accrue because of    conservative program license renewal activities is between 23 and 24 person-sievert    (2300 and 2400 person-rem). The large increase compared with the exposures anticipated    for the typical programs is largely a result of the extensive major refurbishment    activities expected to be undertaken with the conservative program scenarios.    On an annualized basis, this is equivalent to an increase in annual exposures    of about 20 to 30 percent relative to current reactor operation experience.   LLW generation from license renewal activities is projected to be between 1,900    and 2,500 m 3  (65,000 and 90,000 ft 3 ) of as-shipped LLW    over the remaining life of the plants. Currently, PWRs typically generate about    250 m 3 /year (8800 ft 3 /year); the amount disposed of at    BWRs has been about 560 m 3 /year (19,700 ft 3 /year). Thus,    the amount of LLW expected to be added because of conservative program license    renewal activities represents several years worth of production of waste under    current operating conditions. This represents an increment over the remaining    life of the plants of about 11 percent annually for the BWRs and about    30 percent annually for the PWRs relative to what would be produced with    present-basis, continued plant operation. The larger percentage of PWR LLW results    primarily from the large volume of the steam generators, which it is assumed    will be replaced for the conservative program.   Table 2.11 indicates that the overall incremental costs associated with conservative    program license renewal activities are projected to be in the range of $450    million to $500 million per plant (1994 dollars). With current nuclear plant    operation, annual expenditures for fuel, O&M, and capital costs are in the    range of $150 million to $250 million, depending on individual plant conditions.    Thus, the license renewal expenditures represent 2 to 4 years of current    overall operating costs.   2.6.5 Impact Initiator Estimate Uncertainties   The NRC staff believes that the license renewal scenarios presented in Section    2.6.4 reasonably characterize both the nature and magnitude of licensee activities    that may be undertaken in support of license renewal and extended plant life.    Both the typical and conservative programs include some discretionary activities    that are assumed to be undertaken by licensees to better ensure economical and    reliable plant operation, and that are in addition to those activities performed    to meet the requirements of 10 CFR Part 54. The licensee actions in response    to the 10 CFR Part 54 requirements, believed to be fairly modest, consist of    a considerably smaller set of activities than those characterized for the typical    license renewal scenarios. Appendix B presents estimates of impact initiator    quantities strictly related to meeting the requirements of the license renewal    rule. Thus, a broad spectrum of license renewal programs are possible, and the    license renewal-related environmental impacts can vary widely from one plant    to another, depending on specific plant conditions and on discretionary activities    undertaken by each licensee/applicant. This variability in program characteristics,    coupled with uncertainties in parameter values used to estimate specific initiator    quantities, results in a considerable degree of uncertainty in the estimates    presented in Tables 2.8 and 2.11. Although a rigorous uncertainty analysis    has not been performed, the estimates of individual impact initiators provided    in Table 2.8 for the typical programs are judged to have uncertainties    in the range of 30 percent. The more bounding assumptions employed for    the conservative scenarios reduce the likelihood that the actual impact initiators    experienced could be much higher than those presented in Table 2.11. The    uncertainty range for the Table 2.11 estimates, therefore, is judged to    be on the order of +10 percent to -30 percent.       2.7 Summary       [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents  ]   This chapter described operating U.S. nuclear power plants and described the    nature of their interactions with the environment. The basic requirements of    the license renewal rule, 10 CFR Part 54, were reviewed with the focus    on aspects which may result in incremental environmental impacts. Chapter 2    also described both typical and conservative license renewal programs characterized    for the purpose of estimating license renewal-related environmental impacts.    Estimates were provided of environmental impact initiators associated with these    programs. These impact initiators are used in the balance of this document to    identify and quantify anticipated environmental impacts associated with nuclear    power plant license renewal.       2.8 Endnotes       [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents  ]       Construction of nuclear units Grand Gulf Unit 2, Perry Unit 2, and Washington      Nuclear Project Units 1, 3, 4, and 5 has been suspended; therefore, these      units are not considered in this GEIS.

This is referred to as the Condit Dam Removal Project .    PacifiCorp has applied to the Department of Ecology for a section 401 certification under the Clean Water Act. Ecology has also determined that a stormwater NPDES permit under the Clean Water Act, which Ecology has state jurisdiction to issue, will likely be required for the project.   Ecology has determined that an environmental impact statement (EIS) will be required for the Project pursuant to Chapter 43.21C RCW. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared an EIS in connection with its decision on relicensing the hydroelectric project. Ecology has determined that supplemental environmental review needs to be completed to address aspects of the dam removal project not covered by the 1996 EIS.    NOTE:  This  public notice   (PDF) is requesting comments on both the scoping of an EIS and the notice of application for a 401 Water Quality Certification for the proposed project. Deadline for comments is  November 21, 2001    Additional documents relating to the Condit Dam include:    Determination of Significance and Scoping Notice and Public Notice of Application for Water Quality Certification  (PDF)    PacifiCorp's Application for New License -- Vol. 1, Exhibits A and B  (PDF)    Condit Hydroelectric Project Removal Plan Summary  (PDF)    PDFs require version 4.0 or later of  Adobe Acrobat Reader Software .  This software is free      If you have questions about the 401 Certification process, please contact  Loree' Randall .

GX269-86-4093369	"Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota 1. What is nuclear power?  Generically, nuclear power uses the heat from nuclear fission (the splitting of uranium atoms) to heat water. In turn, the hot water is used to turn a turbine to create electricity. Prairie Island is a pressurized-water reactor (PWR). PWRs keep water under pressure so that it heats, but does not boil. See Attachment 1 for a picture of a PWR. One loop of water runs out of the reactor core where it is heated, through a steam generator where its heat is transferred to a second loop of water, and back to the reactor core to be reheated. A second loop of water runs out of a condenser where it is cooled, into the steam generator to gain heat from the first loop, past a turbine to create electricity, and back to the condenser again. In this way, water from the reactor and the water in the steam generator that turns the turbine never mix; most of the radioactivity stays in the reactor area. Finally, there is a third loop of cooling water which runs into and out of the condenser to cool the second loop. By contrast, Monticello is a boiling water reactor (BWR). BWRs are similar to PWRs but actually boil the water. See Attachment 1 for a picture of a BWR. At Monticello, the water in the core is boiled into steam, which is sent through a turbine to create electricity, through a condenser where it is cooled, and back to the reactor core. There is a second loop of cooling water which runs into and out of the condenser to cool the first loop. 2. How does the reactor work?  In both PWRs and BWRs the reactor operates in the same manner. Uranium-235, representing about 3.5 percent of the Uranium in the reactor fuel absorbs a neutron, transforming U-235 into U-236. Since U-236 is unstable, it breaks down or ""fissions"" into a small amount of heat, 2 smaller radioactive elements, plus new neutrons. These new neutrons can also be absorbed by some of the surrounding U-235, creating more U236 fissions and, thus, a chain reaction. In addition, some of the neutrons are absorbed by Uranium-238, which eventually leads to Plutonium. When the chain reaction is selfsustaining, the reactor is said to have reached criticality. The chain reaction is controlled in different ways, but most prominently through control rods. Basically, control rods are made of materials that can absorb neutrons without fissioning. Control rods are separate from fuel rods, which contain the Uranium. More control rods absorb more neutrons, slowing the chain reaction while fewer control rods absorb fewer neutrons, speeding up the chain reaction. Thus, through the control rods, criticality is maintained without allowing a run-away chain reaction. In power reactors,   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 2 of 16  12/12/02  if a run-away chain reaction occurs, the nuclear fuel overheats and begins to melt; it would not explode. 3. So what happened to Three Mile Island and Chernobyl?  At Three Mile Island, a combination of two failures  a main feedwater pump failed and a valve in the emergency feedwater system was left closed after a test  caused some of the fuel to melt and the release of a small amount of radiation. At Chernobyl, the reactor was undergoing a test. During the test, the power level dropped too low, which causes instability in Chernobyl-type reactors. The operators continued the test when they should have shutdown. The result was that the fuel overheated and turned the water into steam. The pressure from the steam led to a ""steam explosion"" which destroyed the area around the reactor, leading to fires and a release of radiation. A summary from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of these accidents is included as Attachment 2. 4. How much nuclear power does Minnesota use?  In 2001 Minnesotans used a total of approximately 61,725 Giga-Watt Hours1 (GWh) of electricity produced by all kinds of fuel,2 while Xcel provided a total of approximately 29,675.3 GWh of this total to its Minnesota customers. Approximately 19 percent of the GWh used by Minnesotans and 40 percent of the GWh used by Xcel's customers comes from nuclear facilities (Prairie Island and Monticello). See Table 1 below. Table 1: Nuclear Power in Minnesota Production Prairie Island Monticello Total Nuclear 5. 2001 GWh 7,912.7 3,876.3 11,789.0 % of Minn. 12.8% 6.3% 19.1% 3  % of Xcel 26.7% 13.1% 39.7%  So, what is a giga-watt hour?

Fuels include coal, natural gas, wind, etc. Data from Xcel's September 19, 2002 Electric Utility Annual Report-Correction (REIS).  2   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 3 of 16  12/12/02  It takes 100 watt-hours to light a one hundred-watt light bulb for one hour. Therefore, 1 giga-watt hour can light up 10 million hundred-watt light bulbs for one hour each (to determine this, divide 1 billion watt-hours (1 GWh) by 100). 6. What is the cost to ratepayers for nuclear power?  Xcel's Prairie Island facility is among the cheapest producing facilities it owns. See Table 2 below. Table 2: Costs at Xcel's Major Power Plants Plant Sherburne County A.S. King Riverside Prairie Island High Bridge Monticello Black Dog Angus Anson 7. Production Expenses per kWh $0.0131 $0.0149 $0.0164 $0.0192 $0.0207 $0.0243 $0.0265 $0.0737 4  Primary Fuel Coal Coal Coal Nuclear Coal Nuclear Coal Natural Gas  What is the cost of the plant at Prairie Island?  As of the beginning of 2002 the gross plant balance of Prairie Island was $895,031,102 for the generating station and $32,584,176 for the interim storage facility. Thus, the total gross plant balance was $927,615,278. Gross plant balance is the cost of the equipment currently at Prairie Island. This amount is currently scheduled to be fully depreciated in 2007 and was about 67 percent depreciated as of the beginning of 2002. 8. What kinds of waste result from nuclear power?  5  There are two types of radioactive waste from nuclear power plants, high-level waste and low-level waste. The low-level radioactive waste can be defined as everything that is not high-level waste (that is waste from power reactors or bomb making) or Uranium mining tailings. See Attachment 3 for more details on definitions. 9. What is the low-level waste situation?  4 Data taken from purposes ""major"" connected to load 5 Data taken from  Xcel's FERC Form No. 1 filing for the year ended December 31, 2001. For these is defined as plants with over 100 MW of installed capacity and more than 1,000 hours in 2001. Xcel's 2002 Review of Remaining Lives made February 15, 2002.  3   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 4 of 16  12/12/02  Low-level waste is less radioactive and can come from nuclear reactors or other users of radioactive material, like hospitals or research institutes. The NRC has defined four different types of low-level waste, referred to as Class A, Class B, Class C, and Greater than C. Class A has the lowest level of radioactivity and Class C and above has the highest level of radioactivity. Under the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980, states have responsibility for disposing of low-level waste. Specifically, states are responsible for disposing Class A, Class B, and Class C waste while Greater than C waste is a federal responsibility. The states were encouraged by the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act to join regional compacts to jointly find a single disposal site for all members of the compact. Since low-level waste is less radioactive, it is less hazardous than high-level waste and can be shipped to disposal facilities where it can be packaged, buried in trenches, and covered with soil. Minnesota is a member of the Midwest Compact along with Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Ohio. The Midwest Compact failed to find a disposal site, voting on June 26, 1997 to halt development of a facility in Ohio. Currently, Minnesota's low-level waste is shipped out of state for disposal at a commercial disposal facility. 10. Where can the low-level waste go?  There have been seven operating commercial facilities in the United States licensed to bury low-level radioactive wastes. They are located at:        West Valley, New York; Maxey Flats near Morehead, Kentucky; Sheffield, Illinois; Betty, Nevada; Hanford, Washington; Clive, Utah; and Barnwell, South Carolina.  At the present time, only the latter three sites are receiving waste for burial. The Hanford site is accepting waste only from 10 states in the northwest and Rocky Mountains.6 State law in South Carolina phases out acceptance of non-Atlantic Compact Waste by 2008.7 Finally, the site in Utah can only receive Class A waste. The owner, Envirocare of Utah, Inc., filed a request to be able to receive all types of low-level waste. A final decision granting the request was issued on July 9, 2001. However, this approval was conditioned on Legislative approval. Envirocare recently determined it would not seek legislative or gubernatorial approval for its Class B and Class C waste proposal. 6 These states are Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming from the Northwest Compact and Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico from the Rocky Mountain Compact. 7 The Atlantic Compact consists of South Carolina, Connecticut, and New Jersey.  4   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 5 of 16  12/12/02  Currently, the low-level waste from Prairie Island goes to Barnwell, South Carolina but will most likely go to Clive, Utah as South Carolina phases-out accepting non-Atlantic Compact wastes. 11. How much low-level waste does Minnesota produce?  According to the Midwest Compact, in 1998 Minnesota produced a total of 1,316.6 cu. ft. of low level waste by volume and 314.0 curies by activity. In volume terms, about 95 percent of the waste came from utilities. In activity terms about 80 percent of the waste came from utilities. The other sources of waste were academia, government, and industry. The low-level waste originating in Minnesota represents about 0.10 percent of the nation's low-level waste that was disposed in 2000.8 12. What is the high-level waste situation?  Each reactor at Prairie Island holds 121 fuel assemblies. Each fuel assembly will eventually fill 1 slot in the spent fuel pool or a single slot in a dry cask. A fuel assembly is a bundle of 179 fuel rods. The fuel rod is a tube about 12 feet long filled with uranium pellets and is as wide as your finger. The reactor can run about a year and a half before it must shut down for refueling and maintenance. During refueling approximately 48 of the fuel assemblies are removed from the reactor and replaced with new fuel. Spent fuel is highly radioactive because it contains byproducts that were created while the reactor was operating. Some of these byproducts will take many years to decay or lose their radioactivity. The half-life of a radioactive element is the amount of time it takes for one-half of the quantity of that element to decay--either to a stable form, or to another radioactive element in a ""decay chain."" After ten half-lives, one thousandth of the original concentration is left; after 20 half lives, one millionth. Generally 10 to 20 half lives is called the hazardous life of the waste. Example: Plutonium-239, which is contained in spent fuel, has a half-life of 24,400 years. Thus, Pu-239 is hazardous for at least a quarter million years (24,400 years per half-life x 10 half-lives). Due to the intense radioactivity and long half-life, a special disposal site is needed for high-level wastes in the long-term. The U. S. Department of Energy is exploring building a long-term, high-level waste disposal site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.9 These activities are being paid for by the users of nuclear power by a special, $0.001 per kWh fee. Individual utilities are responsible for the short-term storage needed until the longterm storage site is available. 13. 8  How much have Xcel's ratepayers paid to DOE for high-level waste storage?  Data from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Midwest Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact Commission. 9 The latest step taken by DOE was the site recommendation that was approved by Congress in 2002. DOE's schedule calls for site recommendation to be followed by a license application in 2003, construction authorization in 2006, amended license to receive spent fuel in 2008, and initial acceptance of spent fuel in 2010.  5   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 6 of 16  12/12/02  As of March 2002 Xcel's ratepayers have paid $360.1 million. This consists of $236.4 million in principle and $123.7 million in interest. Going forward, this will be 1 mil per kWh, or about $11.8 million annually based on 2001 production. Overall, DOE has collected $20.1 billion from state, federal, and industry sources in principle and interest through March 2002. Of that amount, less than $6 billion has been disbursed. The Defense Waste Account also funds high-level waste storage. 14. When will Yucca Mountain be ready?  In 1982 Congress directed DOE to build a permanent national high-level waste storage facility and begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. DOE signed contracts with utilities owning nuclear plants to that effect. However, Yucca Mountain is currently estimated to be ready to accept waste in 2010 at the earliest. The U.S. Government Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report in December 2001 which estimated that Yucca Mountain may not be ready to accept waste until 2015, five years later than the current estimate of 2010. That GAO estimate assumed that no other problems, such as failure of congress to increase the project's budget as needed, occurred. This report noted that DOE is exploring other ways to begin accepting waste in 2010. 15. Since DOE missed its deadline, what happened?  In 1998 Xcel brought a lawsuit against the DOE. Xcel's claim is that DOE breached the contract under which DOE was to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. Xcel's lawsuit seeks more than $1 billion in damages resulting from DOE's breach. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed Xcel's lawsuit. However, on August 31, 2000 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington D.C. revived Xcel's lawsuit and sent the case back to the Federal Court of Claims for a determination of damages. At this time, a determination of damages is still pending. 16. Since Yucca Mountain isn't ready, how much space does Prairie Island need?  According to Xcel, Prairie Island would require a total of 2,393 storage spaces on site to operate until the end of Prairie Island's licenses in 2013 and 2014.10 Current law in effect authorizes a total of 1,971 storage spaces.11 Thus, 422, more storage spaces are required in order to operate to the end of the current licenses. If Prairie Island's license life were extended significant additional storage would be required. 17. How does a license life get extended? 8 consolidated assemblies, equals  2014, filed July 10, 2000. for dual-core off load, less 48 taken from Xcel's Resource Plan  10 2,653 total assemblies used, less 242 assemblies left in reactor, less 1 2,393 assemblies to store. Data taken from Xcel's Resource Plan 2000 11 1,386 normal spaces in pool, plus 680 spaces in casks, less 47 spaces spaces filled with hardware equals 1,971 storage spaces available. Data 2000  2014, filed July 10, 2000.  6   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 7 of 16  12/12/02  The process of extending the license life of a nuclear power plant is referred to as relicensing. To relicense, the owner of the power plant must file an application with the NRC at least 5 years prior to the expiration of the current license. To allow the staff of the NRC to a review the application's completeness, an application should be submitted at least 6 months prior to the deadline. Monticello's current license expires September 8, 2010. Thus, if Xcel chooses to relicense Monticello, the Company would need to file a relicensing application in early 2005. At this time several plants in the United States have either completed or started the relicensing process. Five plants representing a total of 10 units have had their applications approved. Ten plants representing a total of 16 units have relicensing applications under review. Several additional plants have indicated an intention to apply for relicensing during the 2003-2005 time frame. 18. What are the options for storing high-level nuclear waste in the short-term?  There are three main sites that could be considered for short-term storage space while the long-term storage site--Yucca Mountain, Nevada--is developed. The three potential sites for short-term storage are Skull Valley, Utah; Yucca Mountain, Nevada; and Prairie Island, Minnesota. The first potential short-term storage site, on the reservation of the Skull Valley band of Goshute Indians, is being developed by Private Fuel Storage, LLC (PFS). PFS is a group of eight electric utility companies, including Xcel Energy.12 PFS applied for a license for short-term storage from the NRC on June 20, 1997. At this time a final decision has not been rendered. It is not clear whether the Skull Valley site will be available in a timely manner. The second option is to create a national short-term storage site at Yucca Mountain. A bill to do this passed both houses of Congress but was vetoed by President Clinton. The veto was not overridden. Considering the time Private Fuel Storage has taken on its application it is unlikely that a national short-term storage site could be ready before Prairie Island would be forced to close. The third potential short-term storage site is at Prairie Island. There are two places to store fuel at Prairie Island, in the spent fuel pool and in casks on an outdoor, concrete pad. The spent fuel pool has 1,386 normal slots. In addition, the pool has a cask operations area that is normally kept open for operations involving the storage casks. However, 195 removable slots can be placed in the cask operations area of the pool. Six members of PFS promised U.S. Sens. Orrin Hatch and Bob Bennett (Utah) that if the Senate approved Yucca Mountain as a permanent waste repository, the companies would not commit funds to building a temporary storage facility in Skull Valley. 12  7   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 8 of 16  12/12/02  Currently, the removable slots and 47 of the normal slots are reserved for a dual-core off-load emergency; this is a requirement of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). The remaining normal slots (1,386  47 = 1,339) will be filled in 2007. However, with approval from the Legislature and potentially the Prairie Island Mdewakanton Dakota (see Question 30) the pool could be ""reracked,"" or expanded for additional storage. This option would cost about $22.4 million and would require NRC and legislative approval.13 Reracking would provide a total of about 1,920 storage spaces. That is, an additional 534 storage spaces. Alternatively, Xcel uses large, sealed steel containers to store some of the plant's older used fuel on the Prairie Island Site on a concrete pad. Each cask is almost 17 feet tall, is 8 feet, 6 inches in diameter and provides storage for 40 spent fuel assemblies. The cask walls are about nine inches thick while the top and bottom are about 11 inches thick. Each cask is loaded with spent fuel in the cask operations area of the storage pool. After an inspection of the cask, a custom-built transporter moves it to the storage site--a large concrete pad. Once on the storage pad, monitoring equipment is attached that continuously checks the condition of the cask's lid seals. The cask has no moving parts and is virtually maintenance-free. The storage pad is surrounded by a tall earthen wall and a double security fence. There are other security measures too. Currently, Xcel is limited to 17 casks on the concrete pad by Minnesota Statute  116C.771. The 17 casks hold 40 storage spaces each, for a total of 680 storage spaces. However, if that statute were changed, Xcel would require about 11 more casks to run the plant to the end of its current license life in 2013-2014. Each cask costs about $2.1 million, for a total of $23.1 million for the 11 casks.14 The concrete pad was designed to hold 48 casks, and was licensed by NRC to hold 48 casks. Thus, further NRC approval would not be necessary. As a side note, the 1994 Prairie Island legislation--1994 Session Laws, Chapter 641, S.F. 1706--required Xcel to examine the potential for a short-term storage installation, in Goodhue County, but not on the Prairie Island site. No storage facility resulted from this process. 19. Could these short-term storage sites be made into long-term storage sites?  This outcome is unlikely and would be highly controversial. By an act of Congress, only the federal government can legally dispose of used nuclear reactor fuel in the long-term. Therefore, choosing to keep the waste permanently in the state would require that we build or improve the existing facilities and acquire additional licenses from the NRC. In essence, Minnesota would have to volunteer to replace Yucca Mountain. The long-term storage licensing process and construction process would take several years; Yucca Mountain has been studied since at least 1983 and is still not ready. Furthermore, The cost number comes from Xcel's 2000 resource plan proceeding. Data taken from Xcel's 1999 Review of Remaining Lives, made February 12, 1999. A per cask cost of $2.1 million represents the cost of the last 10 casks (#8 to #17). 13 14  8   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 9 of 16  12/12/02  Minnesota Statute  116C.72 states that no person shall construct or operate a radioactive waste management facility within Minnesota unless expressly authorized by the Minnesota Legislature. Thus, legislative permission would have to be obtained in addition to federal permits. 20. What happens if no additional storage is granted?  Without added storage, Prairie Island would have to shut down in 2007, several years before the NRC reactor licenses expire on August 9, 2013 for Unit 1 and October 29, 2014 for Unit 2.15 Since Prairie Island has two reactors it has two licenses from the NRC. If Prairie Island were to shut down in 2007, two main events would be triggered. First, replacement power would have to be acquired. Second, the Prairie Island site would have to be decommissioned. 21. How would Prairie Island be replaced?  The power produced by Prairie Island would be replaced via a ""contingent bidding"" process established by the PUC. The winning bidder is scheduled to sign a purchased power agreement (PPA) with Xcel during the spring of 2002. The PPA would determine the total cost. Since actually using the PPA will be contingent on Prairie Island not being available, each PPA bid has a schedule of termination fees, to cover the permitting and construction costs incurred by the bidder even if Xcel decides to terminate the PPA before starting to receive power in 2007. Xcel would terminate the PPA early if Prairie Island is not shut down. Since Prairie Island is a base load plant operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the bids should likely be for baseload plants too. Most baseload plants in Minnesota are coalfired. However, natural gas can also be used to fuel a baseload plant but is likely to be more costly than coal to operate. One reason for the increased cost is because all natural gas is piped in to Minnesota and a new transportation pipeline may be necessary, along with a branch line, before a natural gas-fueled power plant could be built, depending on the site. Most other technologies are unlikely to win the bidding process. For example, a nuclear plant would face storage problems similar to those of Prairie Island and wind is an intermittent resource; it is not available all the time. Ultimately, the bidding process will ensure that the most cost-effective replacement will be procured. 22. What bids were received?  Several bids were received and the ""short list"" has been announced. The short list contains three ""half-sized"" baseload facilities and two ""full-sized"" baseload facilities. The most likely scenario is that either two ""half-sized"" facilities or one ""full-sized""  15  As a side note, Monticello's license expires September 8, 2010.  9   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 10 of 16  12/12/02  facility will be selected to replace Prairie Island. The public information on bids is shown in Table 3. Table 3: Prairie Island Short List Company Aquila Calpine-Mankato LS Power Calpine-W elch Nordic Energy Size 585 MW 565 MW 550 MW 998 MW 1,100 MW Technology Natural Gas Combined Cycle Natural Gas Combined Cycle Coal Natural Gas Combined Cycle Coal-Fired Integrated Gasfication Combined Cycle Site Missouri Mankato Rosemount Red W ing Rosemount  This process remains relatively on-track. That means a winning bidder(s) may be announced in December 2002 or soon thereafter with a PPA to be signed during spring 2003. 23. What is the cost to replace Prairie Island?  Table 4 provides some rough estimates of the cost to construct a replacement to Prairie Island's 1,070 MW of capacity. The capital cost would be, roughly, between $690 and $925 million. These costs do not include costs of operating the plants. Table 4: Illustrative Costs to Construct Replacement Power Type Natural Gas Coal Capital Costs Prairie Island Total Capital Per kW Total kW Cost $645 1,070,000 $690,150,000 $863 1,070,000 $923,410,000  Note that these costs are only illustrative. The PPA that is signed by Xcel with the winning bidder would determine the actual cost. 24. How do you take apart a nuclear plant?  The process of taking apart a nuclear power plant so that the land can be returned to other uses is called decommissioning. There are three strategies for doing this. In a DECON strategy, the power plant is taken apart and the site decontaminated as soon as possible. For Prairie Island this process would take about 3 years for planning, 9 years for decommissioning, and 2 years for site restoration; about 14 years total. A second strategy is SAFSTOR where the power plant is ""mothballed"" for a period of time and then taken apart at a later date. During SAFSTOR, a facility is left intact, but the fuel has been removed from the reactor vessel and radioactive liquids have been drained from systems. Radioactive decay occurs during the SAFSTOR period, thus reducing the levels of radioactivity in and on the material and potentially the quantity of material that must be disposed of during decontamination and dismantlement.  10   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 11 of 16  12/12/02  The third strategy is ENTOMB, where a sarcophagus is built around the power plant. Because most reactors will exceed the radiation limits even after 100 years, NRC views this option as generally not feasible. However, this option might be acceptable to the NRC for reactors that can demonstrate that radiation levels will decay to unrestricted use levels in about 100 years. In past reports to the PUC, Xcel has indicated a preference for a DECON strategy. In order to use DECON, additional dry storage casks would have to be granted by the PUC, as allowed under Minnesota Statute  116C.771. However, additional spent fuel handling facilities may be required at the dry cask storage site since the power plant and its associated facilities would be dismantled during DECON decommissioning. 25. What would decommissioning cost?  The most recent cost estimate for decommissioning was performed in 2002 and was provided for a variety of scenarios.16 There are several variables that can affect the cost of decommissioning. Three important variables are the decommissioning method, the operating life of Prairie Island, and the inflation rate for the cost of decommissioning activities. Based on Xcel's highest inflation rate (4 percent), the Department calculated the present value of the costs under a variety of potential scenarios. The purpose of these calculations is to illustrate the impact resulting from various policy choices. Table 5 below provides these estimated costs. In Table 5 the rows represent decommissioning methods and the columns represent the operating life of Prairie Island.17 Table 5: Present Value of System-Wide Decommissioning Costs PI to 2007 PI to 2013/14 Difference A B A-B 1 Safstor $ 827,555,720 $ 728,817,881 $ 98,737,839 2 Decon $ 732,414,227 $ 638,389,955 $ 94,024,272 1 - 2 Difference $ 95,141,493 $ 90,427,926 Method  The necessary funds, based on a DECON strategy and a 2007 shut down date (option A2 above), are currently being collected from ratepayers. These funds are being set aside in external accounts with a target date of 2007 for fully funding Prairie Island's decommissioning. Monticello's decommissioning, also based on a DECON strategy, should be fully funded (in external accounts) in 2010, the year its license expires.18 26. 16 17  Does continued operation of Prairie Island require anything but more storage?  See Xcel's October 11, 2002 filing in Docket No. E002/M-02-1766. The Department notes that legislative action extending Prairie Island's operating life would have an impact on Xcel's accounting for Prairie Island's decommissioning costs. Those impacts would be addressed by the Public Utilities Commission subsequent to the legislative action. 18 Some of the funds set aside in the past are currently held in internal accounts but are being shifted to external accounts.  11   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 12 of 16  12/12/02  Prairie Island is having problems with its steam generators. In the steam generators, heat is transferred between loops. The heat is transferred when water from one loop (which comes from the reactor) passes by tubes from a second loop. These tubes are showing signs of corrosion, which is becoming common in steam generators similar to those at Prairie Island. In response to the corrosion tubes are plugged. By 2001 about 8 percent of the tubes were plugged in Unit 1. When plugging reaches 10 percent more inspections are needed and energy output is decreased. Unit 2 is also experiencing corrosion, but at a lower rate. Originally, Xcel began the preliminary work needed so that the steam generators could be replaced as early as 2004. According to a the most recent engineering study, Prairie Island Unit 1 could shut down as early as 2009 due to declining performance. However, the Public Utilities Commission warned Xcel that it did not support replacing steam generators without additional storage since it would not be cost effective to replace the generators if the plants shut down in 2007. 27. Could you summarize the ratepayer impact of all these issues?  In 2001, the Department performed modeling of ratepayer impacts resulting from the policy choices regarding Prairie Island. This modeling indicated that, compared to shutting down at the end of 2007, extending Prairie Island to the 2013 would result in $0.54 billion of avoided costs; that equals about $4.09 annually for 20 years for a residential customer. Extending Prairie Island through 2033 would result in $2.38 billion of avoided costs; that equals about $6.57 annually for 50 years for a residential customer. The Department did not perform any modeling regarding the Monticello plant. At this time actual bids to replace Prairie Island have been received. Xcel's most recent resource plan used these bids to provide information regarding the impacts of policy choices regarding the operating lives of the Company's nuclear plants.19 Table 6 below summarizes the results of the Company's analysis. Table 6: Present Value of Societal Costs Societal Av Scenario M '30 & PI '33 Monti to '30 PI to '33 PI to '13 oided Co Low $ 1,775 $ 625 $ 1,150 $ 75 sts by Scenario High Midpoint $ 3,125 $ 2,450 $ 950 $ 788 $ 2,175 $ 1,663 $ 775 $ 425  The results obtained by the Department in 2001 and Xcel in 2002 can be compared in a rough manner. First, both sets of results agree that extending the production life of Prairie Island from 2007 to 2013 will result in $450-$500 million of avoided costs. Second, regarding running Prairie Island through a license extension (2033) the 19  See page 102 of the Company's December 2, 2002 filing in Docket No. Eoo2/RP-02-2065.  12   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 13 of 16  12/12/02  Department's 2001 estimate of avoided costs exceeds the upper bound of Xcel's range by about $150 million. Xcel's estimates are likely to be more accurate because they are based upon the actual replacement bids rather than generic replacement plants. 28. How did Xcel gain dry-cask storage at Prairie Island?  In 1991 Xcel applied for a Certificate of Need (CN) for 48 casks and a concrete pad on which to store them. During the resulting hearings, the Department argued for a CN limited to 14 casks. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) recommended rejecting the CN entirely based on the conclusion that it would become permanent. If the site was permanent, Minnesota Statutes  116C.72 and 116C.71, subd. 7 would require legislative approval. On August 10, 1992 the PUC rejected the ALJ's recommendation, concluding that the facility would not be permanent. The PUC approved a CN limited to 17 casks. The PUC subsequently denied reconsideration of its decision on September 3, 1992. The Prairie Island Mdewakanton Dakota Community and others then filed petitions for a writ of certiorari. As a result, on May 28, 1993, the Minnesota Court of Appeals decided that legislative approval was necessary since the facility was properly classified as one in which waste is permanently stored. Thus, the issue was moved from the PUC, then to the courts, and finally to the Legislature. In 1994 the Minnesota Legislature passed a bill granting Xcel storage as outlined in the PUC's CN. 29. What was the 1994 legislation on Prairie Island?  In 1994 the Minnesota Legislature passed legislation that ratified the Environmental Impact Statement approved by the Environmental Quality Board and the Limited Certificate of Need granted by the PUC. It was estimated at the time that this provision gave Xcel enough storage to last until 2001. However, Xcel subsequently re-engineered the fuel cycle and made more efficient use of the temporary racks to extend Prairie Island's life until 2007. The core of the 1994 legislation gave Xcel additional storage and in exchange limited Xcel's ability to re-rack the storage pool or use additional casks, (except for decommissioning purposes) and required Xcel to spend money on renewable energy and other matters (see below for list). The legislation had some generically applicable parts such as:     preventing the Public Utilities Commission from granting a Certificate of Need for a new nuclear power plant, requiring a recording of all proceedings before the PUC, preventing the PUC from approving advertising to promote nuclear power or nuclear storage, and establishing the Legislative Electric Energy Task Force (LEETF).  In addition, the legislation required Xcel to: 13   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 14 of 16  12/12/02         30.  spend an extra 0.5 percent of gross operating revenues on conservation ($8.5 million in 2002; $9.1 million in 2003), acquire 425 MW of wind generated power by the end of 2002, acquire 400 MW of wind generated power if the PUC found it met least-cost planning criteria (the PUC subsequently ordered Xcel to obtain the 400 MW through all-source bids), acquire 125 MW of closed-loop biomass generated power, provide a 50 percent discount on the first 300 kWh of electricity used by lowincome customers, (estimated cost $4.4 million per year). place $500,000 per cask per year into a renewables development fund starting in 1999 (paid $25.0 million through 2002), and investigate the potential for an off-site storage facility in Goodhue County.  Does the local Tribe have any special rights?  Before the authorization for additional casks could have force, Minnesota Statute  116C.773 required the State of Minnesota and Xcel to enter into an agreement binding the parties to the terms of Minnesota Statutes  116C.771 and 116C.772, as well as the mandates for 200 megawatts of wind power and 75 megawatts of biomass required by Minnesota Statutes  216B.2423, subd. 1 and 216B.2424.20 Furthermore, the legislature specifically declared the Mdewakanton Dakota Tribal Council at Prairie Island (Tribal Council) as an intended third-party beneficiary of the agreement with standing to enforce the terms of the agreement. See Minnesota Statute  116C.773. On May 19, 1994, the State of Minnesota and Northern States Power Company (now Xcel) entered into a contractual agreement continuing the terms required by Minnesota Statute  116C.773 (agreement). The agreement also included mention of the Tribal Council as an intended third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the terms of the agreement. A copy of the agreement is included as Attachment 4. As signatories to the agreement, both Xcel and the State may enforce the terms of the agreement, including the requirements set forth in relevant statutes and rules, i.e., Minn. Stats.  116C.771, 116C.772, 216B.2423, subd. 1 and 216B.2424. Similarly, while the Tribal Council is not a signatory to the agreement, it has a statutory and contractual right to standing that may include the right to intervene in cases and appeal agency orders involving the terms of the agreement, the requirements set forth in the abovementioned statutes, as well as any other statutes and rules where standing can be demonstrated.21 Thus, if the Legislature were to alter or repeal Minnesota Statute  These laws required an additional 225 MW of wind and 50 MW of biomass, but the agreement did not include these requirements. 21 The Minnesota Supreme Court has adopted the ""intended beneficiary"" approach outlined in Restatement (Second) of Contracts  302 (1979). See Cretex Cos. V. Construction Leaders, Inc., 342 N.W.2d 135, 139 (Minn. 1984). Under this approach, a third party can recover on the contract if shown to be an ""intended beneficiary"" under either the ""intent to benefit"" or the ""duty owed"" test. The ""intent to 20  14   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 15 of 16  12/12/02  116C.773 or any of the statutes or terms found in the agreement, we can anticipate participation at the Legislature by Xcel, the State and the Tribal Council at a minimum. 31. What is the history of the spent fuel pool?  Construction of the Prairie Island plant began in 1968 with commercial operation beginning in 1973 and 1974. At that time, the spent fuel pool could hold about 200 slots.22 The pool was so small because it only needed to hold the spent fuel until it was shipped out for reprocessing into new fuel. When it became clear that reprocessing would be delayed, Xcel took action to expand the pool in 1977 and 1981. The 1977 expansion increased pool capacity to 687 slots (555 normal slots plus 132 removable slots) and the 1981 expansion increased pool capacity to 1,582 (1,386 normal slots plus 196 removable slots). The pool has not been substantially modified since. Only the 1981 expansion was subject to a CN, then under the Minnesota Energy Agency. That CN was granted on February 3, 1981. 32. Why hasn't Monticello experienced similar storage problems?  Monticello shipped some of its spent fuel to a storage pool in Morris, Illinois. The Morris site is operated by General Electric Company (GE). Enough fuel was shipped offsite to allow Monticello to operate to the end of its license in 2010. The fuel was shipped to GE's Morris facility under a specific contract. GE signed contracts with utilities in which GE agreed to accept spent fuel. GE's facility is essentially full and, according to the NRC, has no plans to accept additional fuel. 33. Does Xcel have any other nuclear power plants?  Xcel does not have any operating nuclear power plants other than Prairie Island and Monticello at this time. However, Xcel owned Pathfinder, a 66-megawatt nuclear power plant that was built and operated from 1963 to 1967 by Xcel. Pathfinder was located near Sioux Falls, SD. Apparently due to operational problems the plant was placed in protective storage in 1967 and converted to a fossil fuel-fired power plant. The plant's nuclear facilities were decommissioned between 1990 and 1992; the plant's fossil fuelfired boilers continue to operate. In addition to planning, funding and managing the decommissioning of Pathfinder, Xcel did most of the decommissioning work with its own staff. Where Xcel lacked the expertise or resource--in heavy lift rigging or rail transportation, for instance--it hired  benefit"" test calls for a contract expressing some intent by the parties to benefit the third party through contractual performance. The ""duty owed"" test calls for a contract demonstrating that the promisor's performance discharges a duty otherwise owed the third party by the promisee. Under this approach, if recognition of third-party beneficiary rights is ""appropriate"" and either the duty owed or the intent to benefit test is met, the third party can recover as an ""intended beneficiary."" 22 The exact amount is not clear; the 1981 CN proceedings indicate 210 slots and the 1991 CN proceedings indicate 198 slots.  15   Minnesota Department of Commerce Background on Nuclear Power in Minnesota Page 16 of 16  12/12/02  outside help. The plant's used nuclear fuel had been shipped off-site in the late 1960s, so Xcel was only concerned with removing low-level radioactive waste. In addition to Pathfinder, Xcel and three partners proposed to build another nuclear plant, called Tyrone, in Wisconsin. NRC records indicate this was to be a 2-unit reactor with each unit to produce 1,150 MW. The proposal to build Tyrone was rejected by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission on March 6, 1979, only 22 days before the accident at Three Mile Island. Since the unit was never built and proposed for Wisconsin, the Department could not locate any records regarding Tyrone. 34. What is the Nuclear Management Company?  Nuclear Management Company (NMC) was formed in 1999 by four utilities (including Xcel) to operate their seven nuclear generators, located in Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The goal of NMC is to improve the safety, reliability, and operational performance of the power plants. NMC hopes to achieve this goal through sharing best practices and by having the utilities transfer day-to-day operating responsibility to NMC. NMC also hopes that the larger company, with more power plants, will enable NMC to retain its employees.  16"

INVITED PAPERS        Wastewater Management In Cabo Verde      Mr Antunio De Cassia Sousa Barbosa   Director, Directorate General of Marine Affairs, PO Box 7, S, Vicente, Cabo Verde  Tel: (238) 324-342, Fax: (238) 324-343, Email: dgmp@milton.cvtelecom.cv        Introduction      Cape Verde is an island State lying in the Atlantic Ocean some 300 miles from the African continent and belonging to sub-Saharan region. This archipelago is a group of ten islands and several islets. The total land area is 4.033 km 2  and it has a coastline of 1017 Km. By geographical coordinates its extremes points are 17 12 N, 14 48 N, 22 40 W and 25 22W.                    The islands     are of volcanic origin and seem to be on the ocean crust between 120 to 140 million years     old. Cape Verde’s natural environment is deeply marked by insularity, predominance of     volcanic landscape with high altitudes and steep slopes, and a differentiated microclimate     and vegetation characteristics, which are a result of altitude variations and the position     in relation to the trade winds. Droughts are well known in Cape Verde and have been the     most typical element in this sahelean country. Matter of fact, this characteristic is     inscribed in almost all of the country’s cultural manifestations.       With exception of three most eastern islands – Maio, Boavista and     Sal - the country is almost deprived of continental shelf. Actually, considering depth up     to 200 meters, the overall continental shelf area is approximately 4.000 km 2 .              Cape Verde has a 200-mile exclusive economic zone with an approximate area of 750,000 m 2  and is a country where development opportunities are limited due to low availability of drinking water, its small surface area and geographical dispersion, and little availability of natural resources. The strong demographic pressure on arable land (more than 400 inhabitants per square kilometre on arable land), the limited natural resources and low technological development have been factors of internal and external migrations. In effect, only 10% of the country’s surface is arable, that is about 4.000 acres, and agriculture production covers for only 10 to 20% of the basic food needs.     The climate is tropical, mild and arid. The average annual temperature is 24C, stable because of the regulatory capacity of the ocean. The average surface water temperature is 23C, with a minimum of 21C and a maximum of 27C. There are two seasons in Cape Verde: the dry season from November to July when the trade winds blows, and the rainy season from August to October. The average rainfall per annum is a little more than 100 mm. This rain is erratic and randomly dispersed, therefore once a while the rain is heavy.     The population according to 1990 census was 341.491 inhabitants and today it estimated to be quasi - 400,000 people. Of the ten islands, all but one is uninhabited and the population distribution is uneven. For instance, Santiago, the biggest island has over 200.000 people, which represents more than 50% of population. On the other hand, Boavista, the third largest, has less than 4.000 people. This unbalanced distribution of population causes very high investment per capita as far as basic infrastructures are concerned. See population table annex 2. It might be worthwhile mentioning that Cape Verde has a very big Diaspora, comprising more than 700.000 people. Most of this group resides in United States and in Portugal.     In general the cape-verdean economy is characterized by a structural imbalance between national production, on one side, and consumption needs and capital building on the other. This economy is very dependent on imports, which is at the bases of the strong structural imbalances. In the same manner, the economy depends greatly on the outside world in order to satisfy the needs in terms of consumption and investments.    Cape Verde’s great economic dependence, illustrated by the dependence of the investment budget of 80/90 percent on foreign aid, is one of the main aspects of a reality which reflects the almost total absence of natural resources. The annual GNP per capita is estimated at US $803.00 but for 30% of the poorer population this amount lowers down to US$100.00. The sector distribution of the GNP shows the importance of the growing tertiary sector that constitutes 60% of the GNP. The agriculture and animal raising (livestock) sector since 1989 contributed only 6 to 10% percent of the GNP.    Administratively, Cape Verde is divided into 17 Municipalities with limited empowerment and greatly controlled by the central government. This fact stems from political disputes among the municipalities that do not belong to the same political party as the Government. With exception of Santiago (6), Santo Anto (3) and Fogo (2) every island is a Municipality in itself.        Environment in Cape Verde      The Constitution of Cape Verde dedicates to Environmental Protection issues. This Constitution of 1992, article 70, chapter II, part 2, determines that the State, the departments and the environmental protection agencies, have the responsibility of promoting the preservation and rational utilization of natural resources.    Environmental issues have been gaining some attention lately and mid eighties may be considered as reference point. The public awareness is low and only recently that some environmental education has started taking place in primary school.    With regard to marine living resources the biomass of cape-verdean waters is estimated to be in excess of 100.000 ton, two-third of which is associated with the islands of large continental shelf, namely, Sal, Boavista and Maio. Of this total, 35.000 tons represents demersals species and 65.000 tons pelagic ones. Additionally, Cape Verde is located on route of migrations of tuna fish; even tough several species are sedentary. In some coastal areas sea turtles have nests whereby they do the breeding. Green and rose lobsters are abundant.    The flora is composed of 240 aboriginal  taxa , being 84 of these found exclusively in this country. There are a few endangered species that can be found in some islands. Presently about 45 aboriginal  taxa  are extinct due to deforestation. The terrestrial fauna is mainly composed of birds, reptiles and arthropods. Out of the 36 bird species that reproduces in Cape Verde, 17 (47,2%) are in danger of extinction. Seven of 28 reptile  taxa  in Cape Verde are also in danger of extinction. The entomological aspect of the cape-verdean fauna, one can account for 470 coleopteran species, being 155 found exclusively in this region. About 301 (64%) of this species are in danger of extinction and, it is presumed that 70 species are extinct.    The environmental legislation is incomplete and recent. In 1993 the basic law of the Environment was enacted – Law 86/IV/93. Several disperse pieces of legislation is into force but does not cover all aspect of environment protection. It seems that the lawmakers are aware of this handicap and some proposals are now being drafted to fill the gaps that still are in place. Exception is made relative to Law 79/III/90, which defines the marine protected areas. However, this law still requires regulation.        Water Resources and Sanitation      As stated above, water is scarce and in fact it is the biggest obstacle to development. Since early seventies the source of water started to be desalinization. The first island to accommodate such plant was S. Vicente. And since then three more islands are now served with desalinated water, Santiago, Sal and Boavista. The total production of desalinated water in 1997 was 1,681,000 m 3 .    The ground water is depleting by the year and its sustainability can not be guaranteed. Indeed in 1984 the Water Code was enacted whereby the State nationalized all water resources as means to control its use and fair distribution to all.    On the other hand, with exception of desalination, the other sources of water are precipitation that occurs during the months of August and September, water tables and springs. The average annual precipitation varies with the topography and altitude of the islands. Therefore, the mountainous islands of Santo Anto, Santiago, Fogo and Brava have the highest average precipitation. Water supplied by rainfall is disturbed as follows: 67% is lost by evaporation, 20% is lost by runoff and 13% replenishes the ground water table. There are about 124 million m 3 /year of ground water and only a fraction, estimated to be around 65 million m 3 /year, can be technically explored. This withdrawal is lowering this value to 44 million m 3 /year during the dry years (1970-1990).    If the water is scarce, one can conclude that the production the residual water is low. Regrettably the concept of sanitation versus the public health is not very well formulated in the policies.     Cape Verde has two main cities, Praia and Mindelo, the former is the capital with a population of 90.000 people, while the latter has a population of 70.000 people. Additionally it has several secondary urban centers, with population varying from few thousands to 25.000 people.    The country faces a situation of complete absence or great need of basic sanitation infrastructures considered indispensable for the quality of the lives of the people. These needs, besides conditioning the normal development of the sectors of the social and economic life, have serious implications in the public health.    With regard to sanitation, the country’s global coverage is of 25%, thus distributed: sewage system (8%) bore sewers (5%), dry latrines (1%), others 11%. The current rate of coverage of the sewage network in the city of Praia is 9% and in Mindelo 65%. None of the secondary urban centers have sewage network, bore sewers are the only existing sanitation system in these centers. Living conditions are very critical, only 20% of the homes have a bathroom with sanitation facilities.     In Praia, in 1997 less than ten percent of the population benefited from the sewer system, however the system is under expansion. It is expected by the end of 1999 to increase that figure to 20% percent and potentially this figure can go up to 27%. At present the major obstacle to be connected to the sewer network seems to be the cost, which varies from US $150 to $300 depending on the value of the house. This shortcoming causes an under utilization of the sewer network whose capacity is designed for an intake of 647 m 3 /hr.         Wastewater Treatment Plant of Praia      The treatment plant is of primary type and located in Palmarejo, a valley situated some 15 meters below the residential area, and it comprises the following:    An intake structure followed by two screening devices. The first one is made of vertical bars with a shape of an arc with spacing of 50 mm and the second one with spacing of 20 mm. The first screening device is manually cleaned and the other is mechanically cleaned. These devices remove big solid materials that are found in the sewage. Additionally the system has an aired sand removal device of square cross section with a capacity of 36,5 m 3 . A movable skimmer is fitted in a settling tank of rectangular shape, which in its forward motion skims the scum and other fat components of the sewage, and on the opposite direction skims the sludge in the bottom of settling tank.     At the end of the system a holding tank is used for disinfecting of the effluent prior to discharge in cases of emergencies, i.e. cases of cholera, diarrhea, etc. The disenfection is carried out by a solution sodium hypochlorite. An underwater emissary located some 700 meters from the station discharge the effluent to the sea through a diffuser.    The treatment of solid part is taken care by a sludge digester of anaerobic type working at atmospheric temperature. This digester is of conic shape and is followed by a pressing filter, which dehydrates the treated sludge after mixing it with a solution of polyelectrolyte.    The station in Praia was designed with the following parameters:                Parameters       Units       1995       2005               Inhabitants     covered       Inhabitants       24794       121135               Inhabitants     connected       Inhabitants       15214       101124               Specific load       l/cap/day       85       120               Average daily     flow       m3/day       647       8494               Average flow       m3/hour       27       354                                 BOD 5                                           Specific load       g/cap/day       30       40               Average     concentration       mg/l       705       475               Total carrying     capacity       kg/day       456       4044                                 DRY MATTER                                           Specific load       g/cap/day       30       60               Average     concentration       mg/l       705       710               Total carrying     capacity       kg/day       456       6066            The last available record, in March 1998, indicated an average inflow of 14 m3/hr with a maximum of 24 m 3 /hr.    Routine operation of the plant consists of the following:      Pumping of sludge from settling tank to the digester every morning for 10 to 15 minutes. The sludge in the digester remains there for two to three months. Afterwards it is removed and dehydrated by the pressing filter and disposed of by burying.     Pumping compressed air every morning and afternoon for 3 hours provides air for the sand removal device.    The station came into operation in September 1997 and is run by staff of six persons.    The wastewater are controlled analytically only with respect to physical parameters – temperature, pH and conductivity – and suspended solids. A new laboratory facility is to be built in the near future. It is expected that when this lab come into operation it would be possible to control the wastewater in its chemical and bacteriological aspects.    The complete treatment cycle lasts less than 24 hours and it varies according to the load, i.e. the smaller the load the bigger is the retention time.    The plant in Praia was conceived to accommodate an expansion and to be converted to a secondary treatment plant.        Wastewater Treatment Plant of Mindelo    In the city of Mindelo, S. Vicente 65% of population is connected to the sewer network. The amount of wastewater the station can handle is about 2,200m 3 /day, but at present it receives 1,700 m 3 /day.    The wastewater treatment plant is of secondary type. Before the effluent reaches the station it undergoes a primary treatment at four different pumping station located at several points in the city. This treatment consists of screening in a mesh filter. Screening devices are used to remove coarse solids, such plastic, metals, rags, paper, and the like from the wastewater. The primary purpose of screens is to prevent clogging of valves, nozzles, channels and other appurtenances.     For example, the screening device at Caisim (one of pumping station) is manually cleaned twice a week. The solid waste removed from bars is today thrown just outside the pumping station near the sea bank, so that the sea may dispose of it at tidal changes. Obviously this practice is a bad solution since this sludge, besides posing a public health threat, it is also harmful to the environment to say the least.    In case of malfunction of the pumping stations raw sewage is directed straight into the sea.    The effluent of primary discharge treatment contains unsettled solids, organic matter, and pathogens, i.e. organisms which causes diseases, which must be removed before the water is discharged. The primary treatment is therefore followed by a biological treatment step. The biological treatment units at Ribeira de Vinha consist of a pond system of three kinds: anaerobic, facultative, and aerobic also called maturation pond.    The active agents in biological treatment are microorganisms of which some by nature are present in the wastewater. To this group belong amongst other, bacteria, protozoa and algae, of which bacteria are the most important organisms.    The treatment step has to be constructed to favor microorganisms in the effluent, since they are a source of organic carbon. If the effluent from the biological treatment step is to be used for irrigation the amount of organic carbon has to be reduced or the roots of the crops will be suffocated since the oxygen in the water is used for consumption of carbon. It also important to reduce the amount of pathogens, otherwise these may transmit diseases to the people working in the field and to consumers of the crops.    To achieve the above mention quality of water/effluent, the treatment processes in ponds are the same as the purification processes of water in nature. This is done by leading the wastewater into ponds where microorganisms purify the wastewater. The water is detained until satisfactory treatment is reached. Complete cycle lasts for 21 days. Depending on the main biological activity that is taking place in the pond, they are called:              Anaerobic ponds – dissolved oxygen is absent which is accomplished by increasing       the pond depth, wastewater is anaerobic when it enter the treatment plant,       Facultative ponds – at the bottom of the pond dissolved oxygen is absent thus       creating anaerobic conditions in the bottom sludge, in the upper water layers of the pond       air is allowed to mix the water creating an aerobic zone, also the algae produce oxygen       when creating new cell algae,       Maturation ponds – dissolved oxygen is present at all depths, this is made possible       by making the pond very shallow and designing the surrounding areas beneficial for air       mixing into the water, and as said above algae produce oxygen when creating new cell       algae.          Wastewater treatment in pond system is a simple method of treating wastewater, since it does not require complicated mechanical devices and need very little maintenance compared with other types of biological wastewater treatment. It is suitable to use pond systems for treatment both municipal and certain industrial wastewater, though this category is scarce or non-existent at present.        Anaerobic pond      The main treatment process in an anaerobic pond is anaerobic degradation and mineralization of organic matter by bacteria producing methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfate.     The anaerobic pond reduces the organic load to a level, which is suitable for further treatment with facultative and later aerobic ponds. The main advantage with anaerobic treatment of heavily organically polluted water is that the production of biological sludge is low in anaerobic ponds compared with the production of biological sludge in aerobic ponds.              Complex organic matter               +       Facultative and anaerobic     bacteria                        Organic acids Aldehydes     Alcohol       Carbon dioxide Hydrogen                       +       Methane forming bacteria                        Methane       Carbon dioxide       Small amounts of other gases              Basic Anaerobic Reactions - Facultative Ponds      In facultative ponds the most complete treatment results are gained as far as single ponds are concerned. In ponds systems which includes both aerobic and anaerobic ponds, a facultative pond is necessary in between them to prevent anaerobic conditions in aerobic ponds. The basic treatment steps in a facultative pond are:        Sludge separation by sedimentation,     Anaerobic degradation and mineralization of sludge by bacteria, producing methane,     carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfate,     Aerobic degradation of organic matter by microorganism, mainly bacteria,     Biological growth of algae producing oxygen needed for aerobic biological degradation.     The algae will then either be degraded by microorganisms or sediment as sludge,      The treatment processes that take place in facultative ponds, are of aerobic, anaerobic and facultative nature. The cooperation between these biological processes is complex, but may be described as follows. Figure 1 illustrates the main biological activities in a facultative pond .      In the aerobic zone aerobic bacteria and algae live in symbiosis as in an aerobic pond, i.e. the algae produce oxygen which the aerobic bacteria need to degrade organic matter, the bacteria in turn release carbon dioxide which the algae utilize together with sunlight to create new algae-cells.      When the algae die they will settle, together with other settled solids present in the water, to form bottom sludge. Anaerobic bacteria decompose the sludge since no dissolved oxygen is present at the bottom of the pond. The anaerobic decomposition yields inorganic nutrients and odorous compounds, e.g. hydrogen sulfate and organic acids. The odorous compounds will be oxidized in the aerobic zone of the pound thus preventing their emission to the atmosphere.    In the facultative intermediate zone facultative bacteria are decomposing organic matter. Facultative bacteria are bacteria that adapt to the amount of dissolved oxygen in their surroundings. When dissolved oxygen is present facultative bacteria will work as aerobic, otherwise they work as anaerobic bacteria.        Maturation Pond (Aerobic Ponds)      Aerobic ponds contain algae and bacteria in suspension. The bacteria break down the organic matter in suspension and produce carbon dioxide. The products of the bacteria degradation, especially carbon dioxide, and solar energy are then utilized by algae to create new alga-cells while releasing oxygen to solution, which is then used by bacteria. Bacteria and algae live in symbiosis in the aerobic pond, figure 2. Natural air mixing also provides oxygen, but to maintain aerobic conditions at all depths dissolved oxygen has to be added by photosynthetic activities.        Design Parameters      The wastewater treatment plant at Ribeira de Vinha consists of seven ponds. See Annex 1. Two anaerobic ponds running in parallel; one facultative, three maturation ponds which may be run separately, in series or in parallel; and one pond at the end of the biological treatment to store treated water before it is transported to the water reservoirs. The site is prepared for the addition of one anaerobic, one facultative, and one maturation pond.                                  Table 1.         Specifications of the Ponds                                              PONDS       DEPTH     [ m]       AREA     [m2]       VOLUME     [m3]               A, B, C       2.5       1 000       2 500               1, 2, 3, 4       1.5       5 590       9 600               5       1.0       11 220       12 000               6       1.0       8 170       8 800               7       1.5       2 420       3 750            The area given in Table 1 is the area of the pond. Since the pond has sloping sides the volumes is larger than the area multiplied by depth of the pond.        Operation of the Plant Since Construction to Date      When the plant was constructed, the first phase was designed for a daily maximum inflow of 2250 m 3 /day, but since COD/reduction of 80% in the facultative pond is desirable, the plant is only to cope with 1900m 3 /day. However, in 1992 the amount of wastewater collected did not exceed 400 m 3 /day, the volume of the ponds was far too large. This resulted in longer detention time than wanted, and that together with large pond area resulted in great evaporation. By its turn, due to large evaporation the salinity in each pond increased which disturbed the biological processes and made the treated water less suitable for irrigation .       In order to attempt to find a solution to the problems found several corrective actions were taken since then. At present some 1700 m 3 /day reaches the plant, and the ponds were set up to be working in parallel and subdividing them also reduced its capacity.    The sewage network has been working normally and the maintenance staff has been able to overcome the daily problem they find. Daily cleaning is carried out at the pumping station, and weekly at the site. Physical control is done on weekly base in order to assess the quality of wastewater at inflow so preventive measures can be taken to avoid further damage of the network as a whole.    On the other hand, some difficulties are found, namely shortage of personnel to be on stand by on daily basis to attend the demands that occurs, low inventory of spare parts, lack of trained labor, poor behavior of customers, and high cost of service provided (connection to the network)        Laboratory Facilities      A new lab was recently built and it is fitted with equipment to control chemical, physical, and bacteriological parameters of wastewater, soil and products.    The plant operates with a staff of 33 personnel, and at present is managed by the Municipal Authorities of S. Vicente.    Treated effluent is then pumped to six holding water reservoirs located some 3 km from the treatment site where is supposed to be used for reforestation program and irrigation in agricultural projects. In this regard these projects are now simply on stand-by due to lack of understanding between the municipal authority and the central Government.        Septic Tank      In the secondary urban centers where there is no sewage network, the majority of houses use septic tanks as means of sanitation.    The system consists of two tanks working in series - a receiving tank and an absorbent tank. The first one is made of concrete structure, connected via a siphon to the second one which is made of loosen stone.     The principle behind the functioning of this system is that the sewage upon entrance of receiving tank undergoes an anaerobic biological treatment and the liquid phase of it moves on to the absorbent compartment for infiltration to the ground. Special trucks remove sludge that accumulates in the receiving tank roughly every four years.    Anaerobic conditions in the receiving tank must be created and maintained. The second tank is aerobic and this condition is achieved by ventilating the tank using a gooseneck pipe open to the surrounding atmosphere preferably located at the highest point of the house.    Precautions should be taken to avoid the disruption of the process, namely, keeping the receiving compartment sealed from air leakage, and avoiding the dumping of soap water directly into it since this kind of wastewater might have some ill effect on the living organisms in that compartment.     Regrettably the operation of septic tanks poses several problems to the users. First of all, the designing of the system does not follow strict technical recommendations; often the receiving tank ends up working, as a holding tank for sewage, in this situation cleaning becomes necessary more frequently. Secondly, the location of absorbent tank is located close to fresh water cistern posing a serious threat to public health in case of contamination by pathogenic and other organisms. This situation arises when there is low availability of surrounding area and in most cases as consequence of ignorance and lack of enforcement of the rules and regulations.    Lately, some houses, especially those constructed on the slopes are conceiving systems whereby the wastewater from showers and laundry - called soap water - is segregated from other source of domestic water and channeled to a filtering unit for re-use in irrigation of local gardens. The system works by using gravel, sand, porous stones and foam as filtering elements. The water flowing from those above-mentioned sources is left to settle in a tank where fats can float and then be removed. When it has reached a certain level it is siphoned to the filtering element. The application of this system is being encouraged since it contributes to lowering the consumption of fresh water and therefore making it available to more people and generating higher savings to them besides creating some green areas.    As a matter of fact, in Sal Island the hotel resorts located in Santa Maria – about five – have facilities whereby domestic wastewater can be treated locally and later re-use in irrigation of gardens.         Industries and Industrial Wastewater      The country is practically deprived of industries. Exception is made to a brewing industry (in Praia) a small soap factory (in S. Vicente) and several very small units such fish processing in tins, filling of soft drinks, and some textile factories. In fact this is a good reflection of Cape Verde dimension, smallness.    Therefore when we talk of industrial wastewater very little can be said. The brewing industry located in Praia, some 150 meters from shoreline produces on average 60,000 hl of beer per annum. Being a major consumer of water, it is inevitable that the brewing industry is also a major effluent producer. Regrettably, the effluent produced in this plant is discharged directly into sea without any form of treatment. The plant has its own installation to produce fresh water and it generates more than 25 m 3 /day of wastewater.    Since the brewing effluent is essentially rich in organic matters, this discharge into sea tends to deplete the dissolved oxygen present in the nearby water endangering so the marine life that exists there. Worst of all no prior analysis is carried out to assess the real impact of this discharge. The emissary is located in a closed bay where the port activity is very intense and one may say that that area is a sacrificed area.    Due to the increasing environmental awareness of the society, the management is looking into changing his attitude toward this existing practice. The possibility would be either to connect to main municipal sewer network or to recycle/treat the water for irrigation purposes. At present, the biggest concern regarding the effluent discharge has to do odor problems. This obnoxious odor is being dealt with by placing a mechanical filter on the stream of discharge to retain some malt that otherwise would find its way into sea and further the fermentation process. However, at present the problem still persists.    The soap factory located on S. Vicente Island is a small unit producing 1,620 tons of soap bars per year. The daily consumption of water is about 15 m 3 , of which only 2 to 3 m 3  are wastewater. This residual waste is channeled to septic tank of about 40-m 3  capacity. No previous treatment is done prior to dumping. Concerns of contamination of ground were never taken into account. Fortunately, there exists no wells in the vicinity of the septic tanks, and as a matter of fact this Island is not furnished by ground water at all.    Sludge and other solid material are removed from septic tanks every two to three years by special truck.    Desalinization plants in S. Vicente, Santiago, Boavista and Sal discharge their brine directly into sea. This brine has a temperature of 50C and the salinity is of 60 mg/l.      Finally, huge amounts of superficial water from precipitation find their way into the sea through storm drains and in form of floods. However, this situation arises only when it rains, which is rare.        Conclusion      It stems from what is said above that the management practice of wastewater in Cape Verde is poor, very old fashion and it needs reviewing to be coherent with new demands of an environmental mind society.    A weak point for most environmental projects and programs is that they involve many government agencies with overlapping responsibilities. Sorting out this complicated web is very difficult, as it requires strong political commitment.    There is an urgent need to regulate this sector and to provide means to the central and local authorities to enforce and implement relevant legislation. This activity may be regarded as a challenge to everyone involved in catering for a sound environment since the cumulative effects of poor environmental management might cause some irreversible damage of our scarce resources.

GX255-12-5398296	"Chapter Five - Public Education, Outreach and Assistance Programs    Public education and outreach are crucial elements in any successful environmental program.      This chapter provides an overview of Maryland's nonpoint source related educational and outreach programs as well as descriptions of Maryland's nonpoint source financial assistance programs. The chapter also includes a detailed description of the public participation process used in the development of Maryland's Environmental Performance Partnership Agreement.      Education Programs    Education is an important component of the Maryland Nonpoint Source (NPS) Program. For individuals and groups to gain a better understanding of nonpoint issues, educational efforts must be concise and cater to their individual needs. For this reason, many different educational formats are used to grab their attention. Funding from the NPS Program, as well as the work of individual networked agencies, is used to educate local governments, property owners, businesses, children and local citizens, helping them to understand the importance of limiting nonpoint source pollution. With so many education efforts going on throughout the State of Maryland, it is impossible to list them all. The following are descriptions of the programs that are directly funded by the NPS Program's Section 319(h) grant or are advocated by the NPS Program.      Master Gardener Program    The Cooperative Extension Service (CES) is an important partner to Maryland's NPS Program. Recognizing the importance of community involvement, CES created the Master Gardener Program in 1978 to extend their horticultural expertise to the general public. The program mission is to provide outreach education to the public on environmentally sound horticulture practices. Designed to train and cultivate committed volunteers, participants agree to volunteer a minimum of 40 hours to the program in exchange for 40 hours of training by CES professionals. Master Gardener training classes are conducted annually by CES specialists, agents, and other horticultural professionals. Through the training program, participants are taught many different horticultural subjects (e.g., botany, composting, pesticide use and safety) by experts in the field. Master Gardeners then help the Extension Service solve gardening problems and teach environmentally sound practices. Typical activities include working at information booths at community events and fairs, maintaining demonstration projects, answering garden questions at plant clinics, teaching horticulture to beginning gardeners and youth, and using special talents, such as writing and photography to benefit the program. Eight of Maryland's county cooperative extension offices have Master Gardener Programs.    The Maryland Homework Program    Three Tributary Teams - the Upper Potomac, Middle Potomac, and Patapsco/Back - received a Section 319(h) Grant to educate homeowners about nonpoint source pollution through the HomeWork Program. The HomeWork Program was created by the Maryland Cooperative Extension Service in 1996 to educate Maryland citizens about how their daily activities affect their environment. The program covers topics such as water conservation, stormwater management, general hydrology, lawn care, landscape management, composting, hazardous household products, recycling, septic system management, and private well management. By practicing sound household management, citizens can make a difference in the surrounding environment before costly pollution occurs. Three ""Environmental Stewardship Demonstration Homes"" and one institutional demonstration site have been established. At these sites, the practices promoted in the program have been implemented, providing excellent proof of the effectiveness of the suggested practices. By interacting with their neighbors and friends, and speaking about these practices and simple changes in behavior, the homeowners supply an irreplaceable testimony to the effectiveness and merit of these activities.    Home*A*Syst/Farm*A*Syst    Home*A*Syst and Farm*A*Syst are national programs supported by the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service (CSREES), the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Operated out of the State's Cooperative Extension Service this program uses education, self-assessment, and action plans to motivate rural, suburban, and urban residents to take voluntary action. Fact sheets pull together legal and technical requirements into a format that non-experts can understand. Step-by-step worksheets allow individuals to apply site-specific management practices to their own property. The worksheets identify pollution risks from activities such as petroleum storage, waste disposal and pesticide management. Farm*A*Syst enables farmers and ranchers to identify pollution risks from nitrates, microorganisms and toxic chemicals. Home*A*Syst reaches non-farmers who face pollution risks from faulty septic systems, pesticide use, petroleum leaks and hazardous waste disposal.    Nonpoint Education for Municipal Officials    Nonpoint Education for Municipal Officials or NEMO is a University of Connecticut Cooperative Extension System project using innovative techniques to teach local officials about the sources and impacts of nonpoint source (NPS) pollution, how different land uses affect water quality, and what towns can do to protect water quality. The unique educational approach of the project is to use geographic information system (GIS) technology to simplify and explain the complex relationship between land use and water quality. The NEMO team has participated in a number of workshops around the country, organized by people interested in adapting NEMO to their state, watershed, or community. In January 1999, NEMO representative visited the State of Maryland and provided state and local officials with information on how NEMO could work in Maryland.    Maryland Clean Marina Initiative    Funded in part by the Nonpoint Source Program's Section 319(h) Grant, the Maryland Clean Marina Initiative is a new and evolving effort to assist marina and boatyard operators in protecting water and air. The initiative distributes a comprehensive pollution prevention guidebook for marinas, recognizes ""Clean Marinas"" through an awards program, and conducts outreach activities to promote environmentally-responsible marina and boating practices. The Maryland Clean Marina Guidebook outlines the actions that marine industry professionals can take to protect water and air quality. It is written for managers of full service- marinas with boatyards. The recommendations in the guidebooks, however, are equally applicable to marinas with limited services, independent boatyards, and marine contractors. In addition, the program provides educational material to boat operators, such as a safety card.    Maryland's Nutrient Management Program Continuing Education and Certification Courses    Nutrient management is a process which has as its main objective the wise use of plant nutrient resources. Maryland's Nutrient Management Program is targeted at farmers and can provide them with a number of major benefits including maintenance of optimum conditions for crop growth and protection of local and regional water resources. Since 1992, legislation authorized   the certification of nutrient management consultants and has enabled licensed private sector management consultants to play a major role alongside of those in the public sector. Certification, examination and licensing are administered by the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA). To become a certified management consultant, private and public sector participants must pass the Nutrient Management Exam consisting of 100 multiple-choice questions selected from nine knowledge areas. These knowledge areas are: general nutrient management; basic soil science; agricultural and environmental management; sampling testing and analysis for nutrient assessment; basic soil fertility; fertilizer management; sludge management; incentives; and regulations. Maryland's Nutrient Management Program has played a major role in implementing this expanding education and training program. Additional courses are   offered through the Program as part of the continuing education requirement to maintain certification.    Team DNR (Teaching Environmental Awareness in Maryland)    TEAM DNR is a volunteer program with the mission of educating elementary school children about the Chesapeake Bay and other Maryland natural resource issues. Highly trained volunteers deliver hands on presentations to elementary school students around the State. Their efforts provide an important link between DNR and schools. Since the program began in 1997, TEAM DNR volunteers have reached more than 3,500 fifth grade students. Team DNR offers two separate classroom programs: Chesapeake Bay Watershed and Horseshoe Crabs. The presentations consist of three activities and last about 50 minutes. This service offers teachers the opportunity to enhance their Chesapeake Bay education efforts.    Project Wet    Established in 1990, WET (Water Education for Teachers) is an interdisciplinary water education program offered by DNR which targets educators and young people in grades Kindergarten through 12th grade. The goal of Project WET is to facilitate and promote the awareness, appreciation, knowledge, and management of water resources through the development and dissemination of classroom-ready teaching aids. A trained network of teachers, resource professionals, and citizens organize and teach Project WET workshops throughout Maryland. By familiarizing educators with current water resource issues, Project WET ultimately reaches students by incorporating interesting activities, simulations, exhibits, and models into the classroom. Project WET is a collection of innovative, water-related activities that are hands-on, easy to use, and fun. These activities incorporate a variety of formats, such as large and small-group learning, whole body activities, discussion of local and global topics, and involvement in community service projects. Six-hour workshops provide teachers with the activity guide, information on how to use the guide, and the resources to incorporate Project WET into their curriculums.    Other Education Programs    There are numerous smaller and more localized programs taking place at the Tributary Team and local government level. These smaller programs are specifically geared to local interests. Many focus on providing educational material to local citizens, students and businesses.    The  Howard County Department of Public Works  has a variety of environmental education resources for use by teachers and community organizations. Topics include water quality, pollution prevention, lawn and garden information, backyard conservation, stormwater management, and neighborhood environmental project ideas.    In Baltimore County, the program  ""Let's Be Partners… Water Pollution: What We Can Do to Reduce and Prevent It""  is used to educate children, families, and community groups about what they can do to reduce water pollution. In addition, the  Baltimore County Reforestation Wildlife Habitat Program  focuses on habitat restoration activities: tree and shrub planting projects, wildlife habitat enhancement, and other conservation activities. It supplies a hands-on, problem-solving activity for students to research, plan, develop, implement, and maintain a forest stewardship plan. The program also shows students how to apply for grants and provides guidance on how to follow-up on the development of a forest stewardship plan. Students can also collect data and write final reports.    Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection  staff are working proactively with owners of privately-owned stormwater management facilities to ensure maintenance activities are carried out. The ultimate goal of these activities is to have private sector owners of stormwater management facilities understand and fulfill their maintenance/repair responsibilities. Two products were funded by the NPS Program under this project. A guidebook titled ""Maintaining Urban Stormwater Facilities: A Guidebook for Common Ownership Communities"", and a video titled ""Maintain Stormwater Ponds.""    The  Longwell Branch Watershed Project  was initiated in 1993 in an effort to combine local, state, and federal forces to address water quality and quantity problems impacting the stream segments in the City of Westminster. Two educational products resulted from this project. A pamphlet entitled ""Watershed Management: Longwell Run"" gives an introduction of the watershed concept, explains what types of problems occur in the watershed, and explains how individuals can help. A student workbook titled ""Rainfall and Runoff"" covers such topics as the water cycle, stormwater runoff and erosion.    After ranking horse pasture management a high priority toward reducing agricultural nonpoint source pollution, the  Middle Potomac Tributary Strategy Committee  decided to hold a seminar to provide educational outreach to horse owners. The seminar held in the Fall of 1997 discussed proper pasture management, animal waste management, horse feeding, and environmental awareness. The seminar was partially sponsored by the NPS Program's Section 319(h) grant.    Sponsored by the NPS Program's Section 319(h) grant, the Choptank Tributary Team and Pickering Creek Environmental Center developed a water conservation lesson plan that is being implemented in schools in that area. In these schools, teachers were trained to guide their students in: evaluating their school's water use, problem solving to address areas of waste, implementation of water conservation activities at the school, and implementation of water conservation in students' homes.    Public Participation    The State of Maryland uses standing advisory committees for public input, and a variety of stakeholders groups to solicit input and recommendations regarding NPS program goals, direction and administration. A description of two significant standing committees   and partnerships with agricultural, forestry, marinas, mining, and building associations   is described below. Also included is an overview of the public participation process used to develop the state's EnPA Agreement. Finally, participation of the Tributary Teams is described in Chapter 3.    Standing Advisory Committees    Coastal and Watershed Resources Advisory Committee (CWRAC)    The Coastal and Watershed Resources Advisory Committee was established in 1976 and is comprised of approximately 100 members including citizens and representatives of business groups, civic and environmental organizations, academic institutions, and representatives of federal, state, and local governments, all with a shared interest in what happens to Maryland's coasts. Located, administratively, under the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, CWRAC acts as an independent advisory body to the Secretary of Natural Resources and to Maryland's Coastal Zone Management Program on policy issues affecting the coastal area of Maryland. In order to focus on particular topics of interest, the Committee is divided into subcommittees on the following issues: environmental, legislative, policy and funding, and administrative. The subcommittees take the lead in gathering and analyzing information on issues and make formal recommendations to the full Committee. This Committee provides an excellent opportunity for the representative agencies to educate the public on current coastal issues, but also receive comments from the public on these same issues.    State Water Quality Advisory Committee (SWQAC)    Maryland's State Water Quality Advisory Committee (SWQAC) advises the Secretaries of the Department of the Environment and the Department of Natural Resources on their programs and activities that may have impacts on water quality. Subjects range from Chesapeake Bay initiatives and coastal bays to tidal and nontidal wetlands, acid mine drainage, and protection of    watersheds. The 32 committee members and their alternates represent equally individual citizens, public interest organizations, public officials and economic interests. They also represent different geographic areas of the state. Much of its work is done through subcommittees which currently are Emerging Agricultural Issues, Watershed Protection for Drinking Water, Wastewater Treatment Systems and Wetlands Creation/Protection and Stream    Restoration. Membership on a subcommittee is open to all, not just members of the SWQAC.    Agriculture    The Nutrient Management Advisory Committee is established in law to provide MDA with recommendations concerning policies and regulatory development. This 34 member advisory group has representatives from agricultural commodity groups, animal agriculture, related agricultural industries such as fertilizer industry, nursery/greenhouse industry and crop consultants, the Farm Bureau, Maryland Association of Soil Conservation Districts and the Grange. The State Soil Conservation Committee which provides advise to the Secretary of Agriculture on policies related to soil conservation and water quality includes representatives from all the state natural resource agencies - MDA, MDE, DNR and the University of Maryland, as well as five regional representatives of local soil conservation districts, USDA and the Agricultural Commission. Additionally agricultural water quality related issues are often brought before the Agricultural Commission which provides advise to the Secretary of Agriculture on broad policy issues and is comprised of 26 representatives from commodity groups in the state.    Forestry    Stream Releaf Coordinating Committee    More than 50 individuals and representatives of interested groups from around Maryland have been meeting as the Stream Releaf Coordinating Committee for several months to contribute their time and talents to the development of Maryland's Stream Releaf Implementation Plan. Participants represented a wide range of interests, including natural resource management, agriculture, watershed advocacy, education, state and local government, business and industry, landowners, and philanthropy.    Maryland Forest Association    Incorporated in 1976, the Maryland Forest Association (MFA) is a nonprofit, tax-exempt citizen's organization for forest landowners, foresters and other natural resource professionals, hunt clubs and recreational groups, logging and trucking companies, the forest products industry, related businesses and individuals concerned about the wise-use of our forest resources. MFA's mission is  ""to promote the maintenance of a healthy and productive forests land base so as to enhance the economic, environmental, and social well-being of all who live in Maryland.""  The Association believes forest conservation is best accomplished through education; for ourselves and all who benefit from our forest resources.    Members come from a wide variety of backgrounds and professions. More than seventy-five percent of the membership is composed of individuals who have joined MFA because it is the only organization in Maryland that brings together and represents individuals, forest landowners, natural resources professionals, businesses, and others in both the private and public sectors of the Maryland forest community. They joined because MFA serves as an advocate for them by working on existing problems and identifying new issues of concern as they arise. MFA also works to educate Marylanders on the role of forests, forestry and the forest products industry in our state. Forest landowners and natural resources professionals comprise the two largest categories within MFA membership. Many of the forest landowner members are also Maryland Tree Farmers. Those members listed as natural resource professionals include consulting foresters, industrial foresters, state government employees, wildlife biologists, forest ecologists and hydrologists. Some examples of the corporate sponsors are Chesapeake Forest Products Company, The Glatfelter Pulp Wood Company and Westvaco.    Other Committees/Organizations that represent forestry issues are the Governor's Forestry Advisory Committee, the Association of Forest Industries, the Forestry Task Force, and the Society of American Foresters.    Marinas    The Clean Marina Committee is composed of marina operators and representatives of the Marine trades Association of Maryland, Boat U.S./Clean Water Trust, MDE, Maryland Environmental Service, U.S. Coast Guard, and the Maryland Sea Grant. The Committee helped to develop the content of the Maryland Clean Marina Guidebook and the structure of the awards program. Overall, the Committee has committed to help 25 percent of Maryland marinas to become certified Clean Marinas by 2004.    In addition to the Committee members, the Clean Marina Initiative communicates with representatives of agencies and businesses with an interest in shrink wrap recycling, manufactures of ""clean marina"" products, academics researching clean boating and marina practices, and staff from other states that are interested in establishing Clean Marina Programs in their jurisdiction.    Mining    Non-Coal    MDE, the Maryland Aggregates Association and Charles County Community College have used funding provided by an EPA grant to develop a training video designed to train miners in the proper implementation of environmental controls and to be aware of best management techniques. The video will be available to all mine operators and will be a part of training to existing and new employees. Areas of training awareness focus on air quality, land reclamation and management, and community relations.    The Department sponsors and supports a surface mine committee. This is a standing committee that meets approximately two times per year. Although it is called a committee all licensed operators, interested consultants and other persons are notified of meetings. Topics such as mining practices, environmental initiatives and new programs are discussed and demonstrated. This forum provides the Department an opportunity to get input from the mining industry in the development of new regulations and programs.    Coal    The State of Maryland has partnered with the Maryland coal mining industry to reduce pollution to Maryland waterways through reducing the quantity and improving the quality of run-off from mine sites, eliminating or restricting definable point sources, and treating pollution sources from abandoned mine sites. These activities are facilitated through the following:    The Maryland Acid Mine Drainage Committee  -- several mine industry committee representatives offer their technical experience and background in mining during meetings as well as by providing manpower, materials and technical services during the implementation of acid mine drainage abatement projects.    The Land Reclamation Committee  - several mine industry representatives serve on the committee and offer technical experience and background for non-technical persons, review reclamation plans for every permit application, and approve Phase 2 bond release for reclaimed coal operations.    Remining Initiative --the industry through remining of pre-1977 coal mine permits and reclaiming them to current regulation requirements has eliminated sources of pollution.    Abandoned Mine Reclamation Projects --The mine industry offers low-cost bids for reclamation of abandoned mine projects which in turn reclaim the disturbed mine site into environmentally valuable land.    Maryland Green Building Program    The Maryland Green Building Program partners with a variety of organizations to promote and demonstrate environmentally responsible land development practices that work to limit and/or reduce non point source pollution. For example, the Program is assisting several building industry professionals with the formation of a local chapter of the U.S. Green Building Council, an organization that created the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). LEED is a consensus-based, market driven rating system that evaluates a building's environmental performance from a whole systems, life-cycle perspective. The rating system is based on accepted energy and environmental principles, such as sustainable site planning, improving energy efficiency, conserving materials and resources, enhancing the quality of indoor environments, conserving water, and improving the design/build process. The Program is encouraging the State to incorporate LEED into amendments to Governor Glendening's Smart Growth Initiative that will encourage infill redevelopment.    In November 1999, the Green Building Program and the D.C. American Institute of Architects' Committee on the Environment and the Sustainable Washington Alliance organized a one-day ""Smart Design Forum."" The forum sought to educate public officials and building industry professionals on environmentally sound community design strategies and concepts encouraging alternative storm water management practices and low impact development. The Program also is partnering with Green Advantage, a not-for-profit organization associated with EcoVillage of Loudon County, Virginia. Through this partnership Maryland will offer three green building workshops throughout the state designed to present environmentally friendly development and building strategies to mainstream building professionals and to help them understand how to build green and profit. These workshops include sessions designed to help building professionals understand the Maryland Forest Conservation Act and how to design communities in harmony with nature.    Environmental Performance Partnership Agreement - Public Participation Process    The purpose of the Environmental Performance Partnership Agreement (EnPA) is to provide for the development of a long-term, results-based management plan that will improve the effectiveness of Maryland's environmental programs and strengthen the relationship between the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A detailed discussion of the Agreement process is located in Chapter 1. This section will describe in detail the steps that were taken to actively include a variety of stakeholders in the development of the environmental priorities and indicators.    Public Participation Process for FY98 Agreement    During the first step of the EnPA process, characterizing the environment, the draft report titled "" Maryland's Environmental Indicators "" was distributed to over 2000 individuals and groups, many of whom provided review and feedback. MDE also provided access to the document via its Homepage on the World Wide Web. Additionally, MDE and DNR briefed many of their established advisory groups, such as the State Water Quality Advisory Committee, Controlled Hazardous Substance Advisory Council, Air Quality Control Council, Tributary Strategy Teams, and the Coastal and Watershed Resources Advisory Committee.    First Round of Public Participation for FY1998 Agreement    From May 12 through May 28, 1997, five public meetings were held throughout the State. During the first hour of the meeting a brief overview was presented by the representatives of MDE, DNR and EPA Region III. The last hour was a question and answer period facilitated by a moderator.    Approximately 120 people attended these meetings, and the comments and questions at the meetings were generally thoughtful and relevant. Though there were divergent views on the draft Indicators Report, and on the recent performance of Maryland's environmental protection agencies, meeting participants generally thanked the government representatives for undertaking the initiative, for opening the process to public participation, for listening to their concerns and for the reflective responses to those concerns. The suggestions obtained from this first round of meetings was used to refine the draft Environmental Indicators and also added new indicators into the mix. Both written and verbal suggestions were incorporated into the Indicators and Goals Report.    Second Round of Public Participation for FY1998 Agreement    The establishment and ranking of environmental priorities is a key step in the EnPA strategic planning process. Through this planning process, the State of Maryland and EPA sought to better define the federal-state relationship and advance a results-based approach to environmental protection issues.    From September through October 1, 1997, seven public meetings were held throughout the State. At each meeting, a brief overview of the Environmental Partnership timeline and process was presented by MDE. In addition to discussing the purpose of that evening's public meeting, MDE also discussed some of the public comments on "" Maryland's Environmental Indicators - A Discussion Draft Report "" and gave examples of how indicators would be changed based on those comments.    Two other presentation were given, the first by MDE staff on the Maryland Environment 2000 Project's comparative risk analysis, and the second by DNR staff who discussed their issue review activities. These presentations stimulated a discussion of Maryland's environmental issues and created a framework within which meeting participants discussed and ranked their environmental priorities. During the last 90 minutes of each meeting, a moderator facilitated a discussion on what environmental issues the meeting participants felt were most important to them and what issues were of less concern.    A total of 140 people attended the seven public meetings, and the comments and suggestions were extremely helpful. While the moderators at each meeting focused the discussion on the purpose for the meetings, environmental priorities, any individual concern that was raised was addressed either at the meeting or in follow-up conversations or in writing.    Public Participation Process for FY99 and FY2000 Agreement    For the revised 1999 Environmental Indicators report, MDE and DNR used a similar review process as stated above. Six public meetings were held in January/February 1999, and comments on the report were received via e-mail, regular mail and at the public meetings. Many comments focused on edits/changes to specific indicators, while some comments suggested finer grained or regional data, as opposed to statewide summary indicators. As before, public comments were recorded and incorporated as an appendix to the indicators report.    As the State of Maryland and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency continue to move forward in their efforts to better define the federal-state relationship and advance a results-based approach to environmental protection issues, public input will continue to be an essential element to the EnPA process.    Financial Assistance Programs    There are many different types of financial assistance programs available to state and local governments, institutions of higher learning, non-profit organizations and landowners in the State of Maryland. This chapter describes many of the financial assistance programs that are available.    All Nonpoint Source Categories    Nonpoint Source Implementation Grants (CWA 319)    The Section 319 Program provides formula grants to the states to implement nonpoint source projects and programs in accordance with Section 319 of the CWA. State and local governments, Indian tribes, universities, and non-profit organization are eligible to apply for this funding. For the State of Maryland, projects may be located in any part of the state, with either a statewide or local scope. The control of nonpoint source pollution through prevention, education, planning or restoration must be the focus of the project. A description of the projects funded from 1996 to 2000 is contained in Appendix 3.    Funding: Individual project funding ranges from $5,000 to $40,000. The Section 319(h) grant is administered by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Nonpoint Source Management Program.    Application process: Interested applicants contact the Section 319(h) Grant Coordinator to be placed on the RFP mailing list.    Chesapeake Bay Implementation Grants    This grant program assists states, public or nonprofit entities, and individuals to conduct research, experiments, investigations, training, demonstrations, surveys, or studies related to pollution reduction and the improvement of living resources in the Chesapeake Bay pursuant to Section 117(a). It also implements the Chesapeake Bay interstate management programs pursuant to 117(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The Chesapeake Bay Program awards grants to reduce and prevent pollution and to improve the living resources in the Chesapeake Bay.    Funding: Grants are awarded for implementation projects as well as research, monitoring, and other related activities. Funds are available to state water pollution control agencies, interstate agencies, other public nonprofit agencies, institutions, and individuals in the Chesapeake Bay basin (Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the District of Columbia). In Maryland, the program is administered by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.    Application Process: Interested applicants contact the Chesapeake Bay Implementation Grant Coordinator to be placed on the RFP mailing list.    Coastal Zone Management Implementation Award    Maryland receives funds from National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to implement its Coastal Zone Management Program. Funds are available to support projects such as coastal wetlands management and protection; natural hazards management; public access improvements; reduction of marine debris; assessment of the impacts of coastal growth and development; special areas management planning; regional management issues; and demonstration projects with the potential to improve coastal zone management.    Funding: Assistance is provided to the states through the Coastal Zone Management Act Section 306/306A formula grant for which a non-federal match is required, Section 309 program enhancement grant for which no match is required, and Section 6217 that provides funds for the development of the Coastal NPS Pollution Program .  The Coastal Zone Management Division of the Maryland DNR administers these grant programs.    Application Process: Interested applicants contact the Coastal Zone Management Grant Coordinator to be placed on the RFP mailing list.    Section 106 Water Pollution Control Program Grants    Section 106 of the CWA authorizes EPA to provide federal assistance to states (including territories, the District of Columbia, and Indian tribes) and interstate agencies to establish and implement ongoing water pollution control programs. Prevention and control measures supported by state water quality management programs include permitting; pollution control activities; surveillance, monitoring, and enforcement; advice and assistance to local agencies; and training and public information.    Increasingly, EPA and the states are working together to develop basinwide approaches to water quality management. The Section 106 program is fostering a watershed protection approach at the state level by examining the states' water quality problems holistically and focusing the limited finances on effective program management.    Section 104(b)(3) Water Quality Cooperative Agreements    Under authority of Section 104(b)(3) of the CWA, EPA makes grants to state water pollution control agencies, interstate agencies, and other nonprofit institutions, organizations, and individuals to coordinate environmentally beneficial activities. These activities include stormwater control, sludge management, and pretreatment. The Section 104(b)(3) program funds research, investigations, experiments, training, environmental technology demonstrations, surveys, studies on the causes, effects, extent, and prevention of pollution, as well as other projects. EPA's regional offices select those grant proposals most likely to advance the states' and EPA's ability to deal with water pollution problems. Headquarters also manages grants that address concerns of national scope. Unlike the Section 106 program, Section 104(b)(3) grants may not be used to fund ongoing programs or administration.    State Water Quality Revolving Loan Fund (WQSRF)    Since its inception in 1987, the WQSRF for water pollution control has financed mostly projects that addressed point source pollution problems. However, the WQSRF can be a useful tool in helping both public and private entities abate NPS pollution and achieve water quality goals.    The following types of nonpoint source projects can be funded through the State Water Quality Revolving Loan Fund:        •Landfill leachate collection, storage and treatment;     •Non-hazardous landfill capping and closure;     •Landfill reclamation;     •Barge shelters, containment booms, and other means   to prevent municipal solid waste from blowing off the landfill site and polluting surface   waters;     •Highway deicing material storage facilities;     •Remediation of contamination from leaking storage   tanks, underground injection wells, and inactive hazardous waste sites;     •Stormwater management facilities and capital   equipment such as street sweepers, sediment traps and basins, constructed wetlands and   biofilters;     •Facilities to collect and treat runoff from airports   which has been contaminated by aircraft deicers or other pollutants;     •Highway bank stabilization and drainage erosion   control;     •Streambank stabilization;     •Shoreline erosion control;     •Restoration/establishment of riparian vegetation,   wetlands and other water bodies;     •Land purchase or conservation easements for water   quality protection of wellheads or watersheds;     •Correction of failing septic systems; and     •Agricultural best management practices.              The above is not an exhaustive list of NPS projects that may be eligible for WQSRF financing. Other project types may be eligible, as long as the primary or secondary purpose involves water quality protection or restoration.    For projects where water quality is not the only benefit, only the water quality portion of the project may receive WQSRF financing. The project funding eligibility, or its portion thereof, is determined by MDE as a part of the certification/permitting process.    The Integrated Project Priority System (IPPS) outlines the criteria and procedures for prioritizing wastewater, nonpoint source and estuary management projects into a single list (Project Priority List) to provide low interest loan funding through the WQSRF Program. The IPPS is designed to achieve optimum water quality management results from MDE's WQSRF Program.    The IPPS utilizes the project score sheet to rate and rank water quality improvement projects. Potential projects must meet minimum program requirements listed in the Eligibility Threshold for funding consideration. Upon meeting the minimum program requirement, the project's numerical score is based on the total points assigned to the following three criteria:        •Existing Conditions,     •Proposed Project Benefits,     •Water Quality Improvement.      The relative ranking of the water pollution control projects on the Projects Priority List is utilized for selection of projects to be funded through the WQSRF and listed on the Intended Use Plan (IUP). The IUP is a document prepared annually by MDE as part of its application to receive federal capitalization grant funds from EPA, which are used for the revolving loan program.    For a detailed description of the types of nonpoint source projects that can be funded with Water Quality State Revolving Loan Program Funds see Appendix 1.    Funding: Loans can be provided for up to 100 percent of the project cost, including planning, design, and construction with interest rates set at 45 percent of the market rate. Historically, loans have had interest rates of 2.25 percent to 4.8 percent. The loan terms are up to 20 years following completion of the construction. The principal repayment begins after construction and the interest is payable throughout the loan term. MDE charges an administrative fee of 5 percent of the total debt service to cover a portion of the program's expense. The fee is payable in annual installments over the term of the loan. Loan funds are provided on a reimbursable basis as project costs are incurred. The funds for this program are provided through annual capitalization grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with matched funds from the State of Maryland and revenue bond proceeds from the capital market.    Application Process: MDE sends out solicitation letters on January 1, requesting that pre-applications be submitted by March 1 st . Pre-applications are rated and ranked and a priority list is established. The projects are selected from priority lists for inclusion in the bond bill request for state grant funds and the Intended Use Plan for State Revolving Loan Fund. Pre-applications are accepted throughout the year, however, these projects must be rated and ranked before adding them to the existing priority list.    Small Creeks and Estuaries Water Quality Restoration Cost-Share Program    This cost-share program focuses on restoring streams, creeks, and estuaries in Maryland affected by human activities such as land development, construction of roads and utilities, and mining. It also offers financial assistance to local governments for water quality and habitat restoration measures. Examples of nonpoint source projects that can be funded through this program are stream channel reconstruction, streambank stabilization, vegetative buffers, wetland creation, treatment of acid mine drainage, dredging, and shore erosion control.    The eligibility and selection process is broken down into three phases: Phase I is identification of the water quality problem and potential solutions, along with a watershed restoration plan to prioritize the solution options. Phase II is preparation of project design and cost estimates and identification of all potential funding sources. Phase III is the construction and implementation of control measures identified and prioritized in Phase I.    Funding: Funds for this cost-share program are reimbursed after a payment request is made for eligible project costs. The program provides grant funds to counties and incorporated municipalities under a cost-share agreement with up to 50 percent in funds for the assessment, approved design, and construction cost. Typical grants range from $10,000 to $250,000. Local matches are provided as cash or in-kind services. Other non-state sources of funds, including federal funds, may be used as a local match. Financing is also available through the Maryland Water Quality Revolving Loan Fund Program.    Application Process: MDE sends out solicitation letters on January 1st requesting pre-applications be submitted by March 1st. The pre-applications are rated, ranked, and a priority list is established. Projects are selected from the priority list for inclusion in the bond bill request for state grant funds and the Intended Use Plan for the State Revolving Loan Fund. Pre-applications are accepted throughout the year, however, these projects must be rated and ranked before adding them to the existing priority list.    Maryland Linked Deposit Water Quality Loan Program    Through legislation approved in the 1997 and 1998 sessions of the Maryland General Assembly, MDE was authorized to establish a Linked Deposit Program (LDP) that could provide low interest loans to private entities for eligible nonpoint source pollution control projects. This Linked Deposit Program will allow MDE to enter into partnerships with community lending institutions, to provide an easy and convenient way for farmers and other private entities to take advantage of this affordable loan program for implementing eligible nonpoint source capital improvements.    The LDP is a mechanism that provides below market rate financing to private and public entities for nonpoint source water quality capital improvements through a network of existing commercial lending institutions. The loan application under the LDP is made directly to a participating lending institution, which will evaluate the creditworthiness of the applicant and set the terms of the loan agreement. Upon determination that the project is eligible and the loan is approved, the lender will apply to the Maryland Department of the Environment for an investment agreement equal to the loan amount. The investment agreement will be at a below market rate of interest which will be passed on by the lender to the borrower. The below market rate interest investment agreement is then ""Linked"" to the below market rate interest loan.    The loan repayments are made by the borrower directly to the lending institution. Obtaining necessary federal and state permits for the project are the sole responsibility of the borrower and copies of all such permits are made available to the local approving authority and the lending institution.    The NPS project eligibility under the LDP, or its portion thereof, is determined by the local Soil Conservation District, local health department, Maryland Department of Agriculture, or other local or state approving authority. The following is a list of eligible project types (subject to change):        •Nonstructural shoreline erosion;     •Steam restoration;     •Streambank stabilization;     •Wetland creation;     •Stormwater BMPs;     •Structural shoreline erosion techniques where   nonstructural techniques can not provide adequate protection;     •Correction of failing septic systems;     •Eligible Agricultural BMPs;     •Removal of leaking or potentially leaking   underground storage tanks; and     •Acquisition of environmentally sensitive areas for   perpetual conservation.      Urban/Stormwater Issues    Sewerage Facilities Supplemental Assistance Program    This program provides state grant assistance to supplement loans and state, federal, and local grants when project affordability is a problem. Funds are targeted to correct existing public health or water quality problems. The funds are primarily available for two types of projects: 1) to maintain operational compliance at wastewater facilities; and 2) to assist community wastewater facilities in correcting public health problems. Specifically, four projects are funded: 1) upgrade existing wastewater treatment plants; 2)   investigate sewerage   facilities to correct existing on-site failing septic systems; 3) rehabilitate existing sewers to reduce inflow and infiltration; and 4) separate combined sewer overflows.    For a project to be eligible for funding, the project must conform to the Smart Growth criteria. Both county and municipal governments are eligible. Generally, the grant funds cover the cost for construction phase activities. Eligibility for non-construction phase activities such as pre-engineering, plans, and specifications are based on the financial capability of the community applying for the funds. Selection is based on the severity of the water quality problem, financial capability of the applicant, cost-effectiveness of the proposed solution, readiness to proceed, and previous efforts by the applicant to correct the problem.    Funding: Grants are typically used to supplement other sources of funding. The program may provide grants up to 100 percent of the project costs based on the selection criteria; the size of the project is not a factor in determining the grant funding. Funds are reimbursed after a payment request is made for eligible project costs. Applicants selected for funding may be offered a combination of state grant and Water Quality State Revolving Loan Funds to finance the project.    Application Process: MDE sends out solicitation letters on January 1 requesting pre-applications be submitted by March 1. The pre-applications are rated, ranked, prioritized. Projects are selected from the priority list for inclusion in the bond bill request for state grant funds and the Intended Use Plan for the State Revolving Loan Fund. Pre-applications are accepted throughout the year, however, these projects must be rated and ranked before adding them to the existing priority list.    Stormwater Pollution Control Cost-Share Program    Urban nonpoint source runoff has contributed to the decline of water quality in the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays and their tributaries. With urbanization, more roads, houses, buildings, and parking lots are constructed. These areas are impervious to rainfall, increasing the speed and volume of surface runoff to streams. Surface runoff from storms adversely affects the receiving streams and rivers and ultimately the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays. The increased volume floods local streams, erodes streambanks, and transports pollutants into the streams. Pollutants from lawns (such as fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides), along with pollutants from roads and parking lots (such as oils and heavy metals) are carried in the stormwater runoff to the streams, degrading water quality.    MDE's Stormwater Pollution Control Cost-Share Program offers grants to local governments for the installation of stormwater BMPs in existing urban areas to reduce stormwater-born pollutants. Urban BMPs are structural devices which receive and temporarily detain stormwater runoff. This detention time reduces the amount of pollutants in the stormwater runoff and allows release of the stormwater runoff to the stream at a non-erosive rate. The BMPs eligible for this cost-share funding are stormwater wetlands, infiltration basins, infiltration trenches, vegetated swales, extended detension ponds, bioretention basins, and other innovative structures. MDE encourages the design and construction of innovative stormwater management practices.    Funding: MDE provides grant funds to counties and incorporated municipalities under a cost/share agreement. Up to 75 percent in grant funds can be provided for the assessment, approved design, and construction cost of the stormwater BMP. The maximum allowable cost per project is $500,000, with the typical grant ranging from $15,000 to $375,000. A local match is usually provided as cash or in-kind services, but other non-state sources of funds (including federal funds) may be used. All funds are reimbursed after a payment request is made for eligible project costs.    Application Process: MDE sends out solicitation letters on January 1st requesting that pre-applications be submitted by March 1st. Pre-applications are rated and ranked and a priority list is established. The projects are selected from priority lists for inclusion in the bond bill request for state grant funds and the Intended Use Plan for State Revolving Loan Fund. Pre-applications are accepted throughout the year, however, these projects must be rated and ranked before adding them to the existing priority list.    Agriculture/Conservation    Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Share Program      The Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Share Program (MACS) was established in 1983 to help farmers pay the cost of establishing pollution control practices that protect water quality. The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) has responsibility for this program. In fiscal year 1999 MACS helped farmers install more than 900 projects totaling more than $4.6 million in grant payments. These projects represent an investment of more than $1.2 million on the part of Maryland farmers. This effort has prevented approximately 35,000 tons of soil from reaching Maryland's waterways and managed 1,700 tons of animal waste more efficiently.    The MACS Program can supply up to 87.5 percent of the cost to install eligible BMPs. Animal waste storage facilities, grade stabilization structures, and grassed waterways are among 27 BMPs eligible for cost-share funds through MACS. The costs for installing BMPs vary depending by site, the scope of the problem, and local construction costs. The maximum levels of assistance available through MACS follow:    Funding: The cost of installing eligible BMPs for animal waste structures, not to exceed $75,000 per project and a total of $100,000 per farm. For all other BMPs installed the cost share is not to exceed $20,000 per project or $50,000 per farm and up to $40,000 per project under a combined agreement targeting a pollution control problem on two or more farms.    A flat rate ceiling applies to all BMP components. Under the ceiling, the average allowable rates for materials and services required to install a BMP are established annually for each county. Actual MACS grant amounts are based on the application of these standard flat rates to the eligible components approved for each project.    The 27 eligible BMPs that reduce soil, nutrients, and animal wastes entering state waterways include:        •Animal waste management systems,     •Contour farming/orchards,     •Critical area planting,     •Dead bird composting facilities,     •Diversions,     •Field borders/windbreaks,     •Filter strips,     •Grade stabilization structures,     •Grassed waterways,     •Lined waterways/outlets,     •Roof runoff management,     •Sediment basins,     •Spring developments,     •Stream crossings,     •Stream fencing,     •Stripcropping, and     •Terrace systems.      To be eligible for the MACS Program: applicants must be individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusts, or other businesses operating a Maryland farm; there must be an existing or potentially critical condition on agricultural land causing soil, nutrients, or other pollutants to run off and enter state waters; the proposed project will improve water quality; and the proposed project meets MACS eligibility criteria and cost-effectiveness requirements.    Application Process: To receive a MACS grant, applicants must contact their local SCD; the staff will provide free technical assistance in designing a project tailored to site conditions, needs, and the farming operation. A wide range of BMPs is available to combat both existing and potential sources of pollution on a farm. The SCD staff will identify those BMPs that minimize pollution from a particular farm while maintaining or improving production, determine costs for installing individual BMPs, and establish eligibility levels for MACS funding. Assistance with MACS applications, project design and layout, construction reviews, and payment claims is also available. Applicants can apply for cost-share funds through the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA). In many instances, FSA and MACS funds can be combined for maximum assistance.    Pilot Poultry Litter Transport Program    A four-year, $750,000 pilot Poultry Litter Transport Project has been established to help Maryland farmers make the transition to phosphorus-based nutrient management mandated by the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998. Supported by the Maryland Department of Agriculture and Delmarva poultry companies--who have agreed to match state funding for the program--the project provides cost-share assistance of up to $20 per ton to farmers with excesses to help offset poultry litter testing, loading and transportation costs. The project is available to poultry farmers in all areas of the state that are experiencing phosphorus over enrichment, however, added incentives will be offered to move poultry litter away from the four Lower Eastern Shore counties of Dorchester, Wicomico, Worcester and Somerset.    Under the project, litter may be transported out of state and still receive incentives. Although this project is administered through the Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Share (MACS) Program, funds provided will not be calculated against the per-farm allowable limit for MACS assistance. It is expected that the project will support the transport of between 60,000 and 70,000 tons of poultry litter annually over the next four years.    The pilot project is open to any Maryland poultry producer who has insufficient cropland to use all the litter produced on the farm for crop production based on the nutrient content of the litter and soil fertility levels as determined in a nutrient management plan,  or  has land identified a being phosphorus over enriched. Receiving farmers are eligible to participate in the project if they have the ability to safely use the poultry litter as a nutrient source and if the litter is applied according to a state-certified nutrient management plan. Recipients who have an alternative use for poultry litter are also eligible for this Project.    Funding: The state and poultry processors are providing $750,000 for this project in fiscal year 1999. Maryland is committed to match funds provided by poultry processors for four years.    Application Process: MACS applications are submitted to the Maryland Department of Agriculture through the local soil conservation district office.    Animal Waste Technology Fund    Outbreaks of toxic  Pfisteria  in the tributaries of the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays have become a major concerns for the welfare of Maryland's seafood and tourism industries and the health of Maryland citizens. The General Assembly authorized   the Animal Waste Technology Fund under the Water Quality of Improvement Act of   1998. The fund supports development of alternative uses and new technologies for management and use of animal waste. It also supports pilot projects which demonstrate or commercialize existing technology rather than develop new technology. Projects involving surface water treatment to reduce nutrients is not eligible.    Funding: The fund consists of money appropriated by the state, income from investments made from money in the fund, private contributions, repayments of fund loans, income from the fund's equity investments, application fees, and proceeds from the sale of collateral related to fund financing.    By law, to obtain assistance from the fund, an animal waste technology project must have a strong potential to improve the public health and environment; preserve the viability of the agricultural industry; and have a positive economic development impact in the state.    Preference is given to projects that reduce the quantity of nutrients in animal waste; alter the composition of animal waste to reduce nutrient losses; develop alternative waste management strategies; or use animal waste in a production process.    Any individual, business enterprise, or non-profit organization may apply, although the project being funded must be in Maryland. All proposals must meet the goals and objectives of the fund. Eligible uses of funding are:        •Capital costs of constructing a project;     •Cost of buying or leasing a project site;     •Cost of utilities used during the term of the   project;     •Cost of raw materials used in the project;     •Cost of engaging an independent entity to evaluate   the effectiveness and commercial viability of the project;     •Cost of chemical analyses; and     •Operating costs associated with demonstration or   testing of the project's technology.      Application Process: To receive application information, applicants contact the MDA's Resource Conservation Office.    Tax Credit for Additional Fertilizer Costs    Some individuals will have to reduce or eliminate their use of animal manures as fertilizer to comply with their nutrient management plan and will have to purchase additional fertilizer, particularly nitrogen.    Funding: The Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 allows a state tax credit equal to 50 percent of the additional cost of fertilizer up to $4,500 per year for up to three consecutive years. Starting in tax year 1999, individuals and corporations became eligible for the credit.    Application Process: To qualify for the credit, an individual or corporation must receive a statement from MDA certifying: 1) that a nutrient management plan has been filed as required by the WQIA; 2) that the additional fertilizer costs are necessary to implement the required plan; and 3) the amount of credit the individual or corporation is eligible to take that tax year. Certification is required for each year of eligibility. The individual or corporation must file the MDA certification with their taxes as prescribed by the comptroller.    Research and Educational Programs    In 1999, The State of Maryland committed $800,000 per year for at least three years for agricultural research and education programs to expedite implementation of technologies that will help farmers meet the WQIA requirements. The original proposal included research and extension programs on composting, analysis of the pilot transport program, animal nutrition management, development of a phosphorus index, and phosphorus dynamics in soils. A cabinet-level group oversees use of the research funds.    Conservation Reserve Program and Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program      The federal Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)   is a voluntary program that offers long-term rental payments and cost-share assistance to establish long-term resource conservation cover on environmentally sensitive cropland or, in some cases, marginal pasture land. The protective cover reduces soil erosion, improves water quality, and enhances or establishes wildlife habitat. Enrollment is based on a competitive environmental benefits index.    Maryland's CRP is administered by USDA, who provides annual rental payments. The purpose of the program is to improve the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay and other specified bodies of water by encouraging owners of certain eligible farmland to enroll in the federal CRP, which compensates owners who agree to adopt certain conservation practices on their land instead of actively farming it. Maryland's CRP provides incentives to landowners to take highly erodible lands and other sensitive resources   out of production, and establish protective land cover during a 10 year contract.    The state also cooperates with the USDA to   provide an enhanced version of the CRP called Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). Maryland's CREP offers farmers increased incentives over the traditional CRP competitive bid process. Enhanced assistance allows farmers to implement certain conservation practices, convert sensitive cropland into forest and vegetative buffers, or restore wetlands, making streamside conservation measures a practical alternative for many farmers. The new program also provides longer-term protection of resources than the regular CRP   by authorizing 15 year rental contracts. For the first time, landowners have the option of selling permanent easements with funding from Maryland's Program Open Space. Because the conservation practices offered through CREP are highly valued, operators need not wait for special signups or undergo a competitive bidding process to enroll. They may sign up at any time through their local Farm Service Agency or SCD office. To be eligible for CREP , farmers must meet the requirement s  under CRP, which are:        •Cropland that has been planted to an agricultural   commodity for two of the last five years and is still physically and legally capable of   being so planted, or     •Marginal pasture land suitable for use as a riparian   forest buffer.      Wetlands, vegetative buffers, and streamside forest buffers naturally filter pollutants in runoff. In addition to improving water quality, they also provide wildlife habitat and help control flooding and erosion. Studies have shown that forest buffers can remove up to 90 percent of the nutrients washing off the land before they reach waterways. In 1996, Maryland pledged to reforest 600 miles of streams and rivers by the year 2010 as part of the Chesapeake Bay cleanup effort. With close to $200 million in federal and state funds available, CREP will help farmers place protective buffers where they will do the most good--between farmland and Maryland's permanent and seasonal streams. The program is large enough to restore up to 100,000 acres of environmentally sensitive cropland and streamside property. Acreage enrollment targets include:        •70,000 acres of riparian forest or vegetative   buffers;     •20,000 acres of highly erodible land (with an   erodibility index greater than 15 or within 1,000 feet of a permanent stream or body of   water); and     •10,000 acres of wetlands.      Funding: Bonus Incentives - Farmers who enroll in the CREP are paid annual rent to take riparian lands, certain highly erodible land, or wetlands out of production for up to 15 years, while implementing a range of best management practices (BMPs) to protect natural resources. Landowners can choose between forest or vegetative buffers, however, higher incentives are paid for forest buffers since they provide a broader array of habitat and water quality benefits. For a forest buffer, the USDA provides a 70 percent incentive bonus above and beyond the average soil rental rate for a particular site; it provides a 50 percent incentive bonus to plant vegetative buffers, retire land with an erodibility index over 15 and located within 1000 feet of a waterway, or restore wetlands. For example, with an annual soil rental rate of $70 an acre, a farmer will receive $119 an acre to plant a riparian forest buffer and $105 an acre to create a riparian vegetative buffer, restore wetlands, or retire certain highly erodible soil. Payments are made yearly for the life of the contract. In addition, eligible farmers will also receive an annual $5 per acre maintenance fee for the life of the contract.    Permanent Easement Option - Landowners also have the option of selling a permanent easement on their land to the state. They can sell it directly or through cooperative contracts with the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation or the Rural Legacy Program. Payments for these easements are based on the fair market value of foregone development and agricultural productivity. The state will administer all easements.    Through the CREP program, the Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Share Program, USDA Farm Service Agency, and private and non-profit organizations including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Ducks Unlimited will provide financial assistance of up to 100%   to all farmers to install BMPs on their farmland.    Application Process: Landowners interested in learning more or signing up for the program contact their local SCD office or USDA Service Center. Qualifying landowners may also sell permanent easements to the state directly or through the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation and Rural Legacy Program.    Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education    The Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) Program facilitates and augments scientific investigation and education to reduce the use of chemical pesticides, fertilizers, and toxic materials in agricultural production; improves management of on-farm resources enhancing productivity, profitability, and competitiveness; promotes crop, livestock, and enterprise diversification and facilitates research of agricultural production systems; examines farms that are managed using farm practices that optimize the use of on-farm resources and conservation practices; and promotes partnerships among farmers, nonprofit organizations, agribusiness, and public and private research and extension institutions.    Application Process: Regional SARE offices provide application information.    Environmental Quality Incentives Program    The Environmental Quality Incentives Program provides technical, educational, and financial assistance to eligible farmers and ranchers to address soil, water, and related natural resource concerns on their lands in an environmentally beneficial and cost-effective manner. The program assists farmers and ranchers in complying with federal, state, and tribal environmental laws while encouraging environmental enhancement. The program is funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation. Program goals are achieved through a conservation plan which includes structural, vegetative, and land management practices on eligible land. Cost-share payments may be made to implement one or more eligible structural or vegetative practices such as animal waste management facilities, terraces, filter strips, tree planting, and permanent wildlife habitat. Incentive payments can be made to implement one or more land management practices such as nutrient, pest, and grazing land management.    Fifty percent of the funding available for the program is targeted at natural resource concerns of livestock production. The program is carried out primarily in watersheds, regions, or multi-state priority areas, and for significant statewide natural resource concerns outside of geographic priority areas.    The program is available in every state, with an emphasis on either state-identified priority areas or significant statewide concerns. In general, priority areas are defined as watersheds, regions, or areas of special environmental sensitivity or having significant soil, water, or related natural resource concerns. Eligibility is limited to persons who are engaged in livestock or agricultural production. Eligible land includes cropland, rangeland, pasture, forest, and other farm or ranch lands where the program is delivered. The 1996 Farm Bill prohibits owners of large confined livestock operations from being eligible for cost-share assistance for animal waste storage or treatment facilities. However, technical, educational, and financial assistance may be provided for other conservation practices on these large operations.    All Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) activities must be carried out according to a conservation plan. Those plans are site-specific for each farm or ranch and can be developed by producers with help from the NRCS or other service providers. Producers' plans should address the primary natural resource concerns. All plans are subject to NRCS technical standards adapted for local conditions and are approved by the conservation district. Producers are not obligated to develop comprehensive or total resource management plans but they are encouraged to do so.    Funding: The EQIP offers five to10-year contracts that provide cost-sharing and incentive payments for specified conservation practices in the site-specific plan. Total cost-share and incentive payments are limited to $10,000 per person per year and $50,000 over the length of the contract.    Cost-sharing may pay up to 75 percent of some conservation practice costs, such as grassed waterways, filter strips, manure management facilities, capping of abandoned wells, and other practices that improve and maintain the health of natural resources. Incentives are made to encourage a producer to use land management practices such as nutrient, manure, integrated pest, irrigation water, and wildlife habitat management. These incentives may be provided for up to three years so that producers can carry out management practices they may not otherwise use.    Application Process: Producers obtain contract applications at any USDA Service Center and the applications are accepted throughout the year.    Farm Credit Program    Administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA), the Farm Credit Program grants small loans to small or family-sized farms. In return, the landowner must agree to conservation requirements. If farmers are unable to pay the debt on the loan, they have the option of entering into a conservation contract with the FSA, in which they enroll environmentally sensitive portions of their property, such as wetlands or streambanks, in a conservation easement. The debt write-off that farmers receive depends on the amount of land included and the length of the conservation contract.    Wetlands & Forestry    Wetland Reserve Program    The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) is a voluntary program to restore and protect wetlands on private property. Landowners can receive financial incentives to enhance wetlands in exchange for retiring marginal agricultural land. Congress authorized the WRP under the Food Security Act of   1985, as amended by the 1990 and 1996 Farm Bills. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) administers the program in consultation with the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and other federal agencies. Funding for the WRP comes from the Commodity Credit Corporation. States were authorized to begin a continuous sign-up as of October 1, 1996. The local USDA Service Center or conservation district office provides the sign-up schedule for each state.    Landowners who choose to participate in WRP may sell a conservation easement or enter into a cost-share restoration agreement with USDA to restore and protect wetlands. The landowner voluntarily limits future use of the land, yet retains private ownership. The landowner and NRCS jointly develop a plan for the restoration and maintenance of the wetland. The program offers landowners three options: permanent easements, 30-year easements, and restoration cost-share agreements with a minimum ten-year duration.    Permanent Easement - This type of easement is a conservation easement in perpetuity. The payment will be the lesser of the agricultural value of the land, an established payment cap, or an amount offered by the landowner. In addition to paying for the easement, USDA pays 100 percent of the wetland restoration costs.    30-Year Easement --This conservation easement lasts for 30 years. Easement payments are 75 percent of what would be paid for a permanent easement and USDA also pays 75 percent of restoration costs.    Restoration Cost-Share Agreement -- This is an agreement   to reestablish degraded or lost wetland habitat. USDA pays 75 percent of the restoration cost. This agreement does not place an easement on the property; the landowner provides the restoration site without reimbursement.    Other agencies and private conservation organizations may also finance easement payments and wetland restoration costs to further reduce the landowner's share of the bill. Such special partnership efforts are encouraged.    To offer a conservation easement, the landowner must have owned the land for at least one year prior to enrolling the land in the program unless the land was inherited or the landowner can prove the land was not obtained for the purpose of enrolling it in the program. To participate in a restoration cost-share agreement, the landowner must show evidence of ownership. The land must be restorable and suitable for wildlife benefits. Eligible land includes: wetlands farmed under natural conditions; prior-converted cropland; farmed wetland pasture; farmland that has become wetland due to flooding; range land, pasture, or production forest where the hydrology has been significantly altered and can be restored; riparian areas which link protected wetlands; lands adjacent to protected wetlands that contribute significantly to wetland functions and values; and previously restored wetlands (Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land is eligible if it meets WRP requirements).    Ineligible land includes wetlands converted after December 23, 1985; land with timber stands established under a CRP contract; federal lands; and land where conditions make restoration impossible.    A landowner continues to control access to the land and may lease the land for hunting, fishing and other undeveloped recreational activities. At any time, a landowner may request that additional activities be evaluated to determine if they are compatible uses for the site. Such a request may include permission to cut hay, graze livestock, or harvest wood products. The WRP will have an enrollment cap of 975,000 acres. Program changes provide more flexibility and help landowners work toward the goal of no net loss of wetlands.    The revised WRP:        •Requires that one-third of total program acres be   enrolled in permanent easements, one-third in 30-year easements, and one-third in   restoration-only, cost-share agreements (as of October 1, 1996). Individuals may choose   the category for their eligible land.     •Stipulates that no new permanent easements may be   enrolled until at least 75,000 acres of temporary easements have entered the program (as   of October 1, 1996).     •Provides landowners with 75 to 100 percent   cost-sharing for permanent easements, 50 to 75 percent for 30-year easements, and 50 to 75   percent for restoration cost-share agreements. Cost-sharing will help pay for restoration.      Additional information on the WRP is available from USDA Service Centers, State Cooperative Extension offices, and local conservation districts.    Buffer Incentive Program      The Buffer Incentive Program encourages the planting and maintenance of forested buffers around the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. This program provides incentives for planting these buffers on private land and defrays the landowner's cost of establishing and maintaining them.    The following lands are eligible for participation:        •Any privately-owned land of at least one acre and   not more than fifty acres which is: 1) crop field; 2) pasture field; 3) other open or bare   ground; or 4) early successional vegetation.     •Eligible lands must meet one of the following   criteria in addition to meeting one of the qualifications above: 1) be within 300 feet of   a stream, river, pond, or non-tidal wetland or other open water; 2) be within 300 feet   plus 4 feet for every 1 percent slope for slopes averaging greater than 6 percent; or 3)   be within the 100-year floodplain as shown on a HUD flood insurance map.     •If two-thirds of an agricultural field qualifies   under the above criteria, the entire field is eligible.      This grant program offers a one-time payment of $300 per acre ($30 per one-tenth acre) upon verification of at least 65% seedling survival after one growing season. A reduced payment of 50% is payable for survival of 50 to 65%. This program is administered by MD DNR Forest Service.    National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant Program    The National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant program was established by the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act of 1990. Under the program, the USFWS provides matching grants for acquisition, restoration, management, or enhancement of coastal wetlands. Over $9 million in grants are awarded annually through a nationwide competitive process. Funding for the program comes from excise taxes on fishing equipment and motorboat and small engine fuels.    States that border the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Pacific, and Great Lakes are eligible. The State of Louisiana is the one exception since it has its own coastal wetland program under the act. Also eligible are the trust territories and commonwealths of the United States. The states provide 50 percent of the total cost of the project. If the state has established and maintains a special fund to acquire coastal wetlands, natural areas, or open spaces, however, the federal share can increase to 75 percent.    The USFWS's role is to review, rank, and select projects based on their national importance as well as to educate state resource agencies regarding the planning and application process. Due to limited funding and considerable demand, projects are selected competitively. The act gives priority to projects if they are:        •consistent with the criteria and considerations   outlined in the National Wetlands Priority Conservation Plan;     •located in states with dedicated funding for   programs to acquire coastal wetlands, natural areas, and open spaces; and     •located in maritime forests on coastal barrier   islands.      The USFWS has developed additional ranking factors. These factors include giving credit to projects that benefit endangered species; encouraging cooperative efforts; and benefitting other ongoing projects. The National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant Program is an effective way to help states acquire, restore, manage, and enhance their coastal wetland resources. The program's emphasis on encouraging partnerships, supporting watershed planning, and leveraging ongoing projects ensures that the limited funds result in maximum benefits.    Income Tax Modification Program      This program provides financial incentive for forest landowners to manage their land. Eligible participants can deduct double the cost of reforestation and timber stand improvement practices, less any cost-share assistance received through other programs (FIP, SIP, WIP, EQIP,or others) on their Maryland state income tax. This deduction is subtracted from the federal adjusted gross income. Practices receiving the modification must remain in effect for at least 15 years and periodic inspections will occur. If the practices are not maintained, the tax savings must be repaid.    Participants must own or lease between ten and 500 acres of forest capable of growing more than 20 cubic feet of wood per acre per year and for which the primary purpose is growing and harvesting trees. Christmas tree and ornamental tree operations are not eligible. Only participants using forest management practices on ten to 100 acres may receive the tax modification in any one year. This program is administered by MD DNR Forest Service.    Stewardship Incentive Program      This incentives program provides cost-share assistance for nine major practices to allow landowners to actively manage their forests. Private forest landowners implementing an approved Forest Stewardship Plan are eligible and the practices must be put into effect on at least one acre. Each plan will be based on realistic management objectives that match the landowner's interests and goals with the capability of his/her land. The practices recommended in the plan that receive cost-share assistance must be maintained for a minimum of ten years. The maximum amount a landowner may receive in a year is $10,000. The nine broad practices are:        •Stewardship Plan Preparation;     •Forestation;     •Forest Improvements;     •Windbreaks and Hedgerows;     •Soil and Water Protection;     •Riparian and Wetland Protection;     •Fisheries and Aquatic Habitat Enhancement;     •Wildlife Habitat Improvement; and     •Forest Recreation Habitat Enhancement.      This program is administered by MD DNR Forest Service.    Woodland Incentive Program      The Woodland Incentive Program provides cost-share assistance for tree planting, site preparation, and timber stand improvement practices. The program pays up to 50 percent of eligible practices and is available to owners of at least ten forest acres but not more than 500. The property: must have the potential to be harvested (when appropriate) for products including logs, timbers, pulpwood, firewood, woodchips, poles, piles, posts, and other primary forest products; has not been subject to federal cost-share assistance in any of the five years preceding application for the same practice; and has not received Woodland Incentive Program assistance in any of the 15 years preceding application for the same practice.    Eligible landowners can apply for specific practices through their local forester. If approved, landowners complete the practices and pay for the goods and/or services. The local forester will then inspect the practice to ensure proper implementation. The landowner will then receive a reimbursement check for up to 50 percent of the cost. Eligible practices include: thinning, pruning, prescribed burning, crop tree release, site preparation for natural or artificial reforestation, herbicide treatment, and planting of seedlings.    This program is administered by MD DNR Forest Service.    Five-Star Restoration Program    With the goal of a net increase of 100,000 acres of wetlands a year by 2005, one of the key actions of the Clean Water Action Plan (CWAP) calls for EPA to work with its ""River   Corridors and Wetlands Restoration Partners""   on community-based wetlands restoration projects in 500 watersheds in the next five years. The Five-Star Restoration Program is specifically designed to meet that challenge. Primarily, it provides challenge grants, facilitates technology/information transfer and partner collaboration, and supports peer-to-peer communication programs to promote community-based wetland and riparian restoration projects.    The Five-Star Restoration Challenge Grant Program leverages its modest funds by championing restoration projects that bring in contributions from multiple and diverse partners. Partners may include citizen volunteer organizations, corporations, private landowners, local conservation organizations, youth groups, charitable foundations, and other federal, state, tribal agencies, and local governments. The project must have a strong on-the-ground habitat restoration component that provides long-term ecological, educational, or socio-economic benefits to the people and their community. The Five-Star Restoration Challenge Grant Program is not intended to be a major source of funding for restoration projects. Rather, the modest level of project funding demonstrates that even a small amount of money can effectuate measurable improvements at the community and citizen levels. Over time, these grassroots efforts will make a significant difference in our landscape and the welfare of our communities.    Challenge Grant Guidelines:    •The stars in ""Five-Star"" are the partners, funders, and participants necessary to complete the project including youth organizations (e.g., state or local youth conservation corps or county job training programs), local governments (e.g., boards of county commissioners, departments of planning, environment, or parks and recreation), and private entities. Projects must involve diverse partnerships (preferably involving five organizations) that contribute funding, land, technical assistance, workforce support, and other in-kind services.        •Awards will be between $5,000 and $20,000.     •Projects must include a strong on-the-ground habitat   restoration component and may also include education, outreach, and community stewardship.     •Projects must demonstrate ecological, educational,   or socio-economic benefits completion.     •The projects must be ready to complete within one   year but may be a discrete part of a larger restoration effort.     •Preference is given to projects which are part of a   larger watershed or community stewardship effort which include a description of long-term   management activities.     •Projects that are part of a mitigation requirement   will not be considered under the Five-Star Program.      The Five-Star Restoration Challenge Grant program is open to any public or private entity.    Forestry Management Cost-Share Assistance    The Farm Services Agency (FSA) and the Maryland DNR Forest Service provide cost-share assistance programs to landowners to help defray the cost of forest improvement practices. The DNR Forest Service is responsible for providing technical assistance to the landowner, helping to find vendors to do the work, and reporting completion of the practice.    Five cost-share programs and one grant program are available to defray the costs of implementing recommended forestry practices. These programs have different goals depending on landowner objectives. Eligibility depends on the size of the property and the availability of funds. In most cases, a forest stewardship management plan should be written for the property. Depending on the plan recommendations, cost-share assistance may be available. Generally, the eligible landowner receives 50 to 65 percent of the cost of implementing the practice. The grant program also provides up to $300 per acre for buffer plantings.    Applicants apply at the FSA office for most of the cost-share assistance programs, and funding must be allocated prior to the commencement of work. Those interested should contact the county forester for assistance and details. The forester can furnish technical specifications and set up the recommended practices. Contract crews may be available to carry out the recommended practice.    Environmental Education    Environmental Education Grants Program    Environmental Education Grants (EEG) provide financial support for projects which design, demonstrate, or disseminate environmental education practices, methods, or techniques. The projects must focus on one of the following: 1) improving environmental education teaching skills; 2) educating teachers, students, or the public about human health problems; 3) building state, local, or tribal government capacity to develop environmental education programs; 4) educating communities through community-based organizations; or 5) educating the general public through print, broadcast, or other media.    Colleges, universities, local, and tribal education agencies, state education or environmental agencies, nonprofit organizations, and noncommercial education broadcasting entities are eligible to apply for funds under this program. Each year EPA issues a ""solicitation notice"" that describes the application procedures and grant priorities for that year and contains all the necessary application forms.     Grant applications are evaluated in a two-step process. In general, non-federal reviewers from schools, universities, state education agencies, and nonprofit organizations perform the first ranking. Often, the evaluation process also includes reviewers from other federal agencies. EPA conducts the second level of review. Factors in making the final selections include: cost effectiveness; effectiveness of collaboration and partnerships; environmental or educational importance of the project; effectiveness of delivery; and geographic distribution of projects. This program is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.    Aquatic Resources Education Grants Program    The Aquatic Resources Education Grants Program provides reimbursement grants for Maryland public and non-public school educators to design projects that help students make educated choices concerning aquatic resources. Projects can be designed for the classroom, laboratory, or field. Projects that actually improve, restore, or enhance Maryland's aquatic resources and are strong in student action or student service learning are good candidates for receiving grants. This grant is administered by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Chesapeake Conservation Education Unit.    Shoreline Erosion    Shoreline Erosion Control Financial Assistance    The owner of any property fronting a water body in Maryland may file an application requesting assistance in the design, construction, management, and financing of a streambank or shoreline erosion control project. Financial assistance for non-structural projects is awarded to the property owner by DNR's Shore Erosion Control Program as a matching grant. Grant agreements detail the requirements and extent of financial assistance as follows:        •50 percent-50 percent matching grants for projects   on private and public lands using state special funds;     •75 percent-25 percent matching grants for projects   on public lands using federal funds.      Financial assistance as interest-free loans for structural projects is no longer available.    Marina and Recreational Boating    Clean Vessel Act Grant Program    The Clean Vessel Act Grant Program prevents recreational boat sewage from entering U.S. waters. The program provides grants to coastal states for surveying and planning pumpout/dump stations. The program also provides funds to all states for the construction and renovation of pumpout/dump stations as well as for educational programs on the environmentally safe disposal of human waste.    Pollution Prevention      Pollution Prevention Incentives for States Grant Program    The Pollution Prevention Incentives for States (PPIS) grant program provides matching funds to states to support pollution prevention activities and develop state programs. EPA designed the grant program to give states more flexibility in addressing local needs. Since the states have more direct contact with industry and are more aware of local needs, EPA believes that state-based environmental programs can make a unique contribution to pollution prevention.    Since the grant program began in 1989, almost every state has established a pollution prevention program. Over half of the states have enacted pollution prevention laws, many of which provide long-term funding for pollution prevention activities. Since the states have developed basic capabilities, EPA has shifted the responsibility for implementing the grant program from headquarters to the regions. This shift gives the regions flexibility to focus resources on regional priorities.    The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) received five PPIS grants between 1992 and 1997 and provided centralized service delivery for the state. From the outset of its pollution prevention program, MDE pursued regulatory integration of pollution prevention into permits, inspections, and enforcement activities. The department also offered voluntary direct technical assistance, particularly to small businesses.    The major activities funded under Maryland's PPIS grant were:        • Awards and Recognition --- general awards   and recognition, including a program to recognize voluntary environmental excellence, and   special recognition to companies developing environmental performance enhancing   technologies,     • Education and Outreach  -- general education   and outreach, presentations/workshops, conferences/meetings, guidance documents, fact   sheets/brochures/publications,     • Infrastructure Development  -- advisory   committee/workgroup, strategy/policy,     • Pilot and Demonstration Projects  -- new   technology development,     • Regulatory Integration  -- integration of   pollution prevention into permits and inspections, pollution prevention and compliance   assistance, training of regulatory staff, and     • Technical Assistance and Training  --   general and direct technical assistance and training to small and large businesses,   grants/loans.      Additional activities include the incorporation of multimedia pollution prevention into MDE's permitting programs and expansion of outreach to the marina industry. MDE developed a comprehensive, multimedia compliance manual for marinas, as well as other educational materials and informational brochures, to instruct boat owners about their environmental responsibilities.    Environmental Justice through Pollution Prevention Grants Program    In recent years, the environmental justice movement has focused on actively ensuring equitable environmental protection for all and empowering those most often disenfranchised from the decision-making process -- the poor and people of color. Pollution prevention can reduce environmental risks while promoting public involvement and economic benefits. Through the Environmental Justice through Pollution Prevention (EJP2) grant program, EPA provides financial assistance to help minority and low-income communities address emerging environmental issues by using pollution prevention as the solution rather than traditional pollution control techniques.    In the first three years of the EJP2 grant program, many funded projects provided general education on pollution prevention to residents of low-income and minority communities and encouraged community involvement in pollution prevention. These activities were appropriate in the early years of this program when community groups were initially learning about pollution prevention and how pollution prevention approaches can be applied to the problems present in environmental justice communities.    EPA is encouraging applicants to develop specific proposals. These proposals may include specific pollution prevention training or technical assistance to businesses in a community; projects that demonstrate the value of pollution prevention at local businesses; incorporating pollution prevention practices incorporated into local projects; or collaboration with a facility or industry to develop a pollution prevention strategy.    This grant program has generated a significant amount of information on specific industries. In particular, several projects have focused on auto repair shops, dry cleaners, printers, and painting contractors. EPA is collecting the results of these projects to make the information widely available to environmental justice communities.    Small Watershed Grants Program    The Small Watershed Grants Program is sponsored by the Chesapeake Bay Program and administered by the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay. The program provides support for communities within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed to undertake small-scale watershed restoration and protection efforts that help meet Chesapeake Bay Program goals. Those goals are nutrient reduction, toxic pollution prevention and reduction, submerged aquatic vegetation, riparian forest buffer restoration and protection, wetlands protection and restoration, oyster reef restoration, fish passage, local government involvement, public participation, and land growth and stewardship. A broad range of activities are eligible under this program. Those of most interest are ones which demonstrate the integration of various Bay Program objectives at the small watershed scale and accomplish direct on-the-ground environmental improvements.    Funding: Non-profit organizations (i.e., watershed-based citizen organizations) or local governments are eligible to apply for two types of grants: 1)up to $10,000 or 2) from $10,001 to $40,000.    Application Process: All proposals must be submitted to the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay by April 1. All proposals must contain the following: abstract or summary, detailed scope of work, project sponsor and other responsible parties, description of target audience, project time line, project evaluation plan, and project budget. Applicants will be notified by May 1 as to whether their proposal is being funded.    Chesapeake Bay Trust (CBT) Grants    The Trust is a nonprofit organization created by the Maryland General Assembly in 1985 to promote public awareness and participation in the restoration and protection of the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay Trust offers grants for qualified activities proposed by nonprofit organizations, community associations, civic groups, schools and public agencies which contribute to the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay.    Regular Cycle Grants    The Trust favors action-oriented activities. Projects that unite business, government and citizen groups in activities which contribute to the restoration and protection of the Bay are encouraged. Priority is given to two principal areas: education projects that promote a behavior change toward the Bay and the performance of restoration activities that utilize volunteers. Proposals should demonstrate that the activity will have a positive benefit to the Chesapeake Bay as well as a secondary impact of encouraging other groups to undertake similar activities. Proposals which provide for matching funds or support from other sources are strongly encouraged. Consideration is given to project cost, geographical setting, technical feasibility and need in terms of the overall Chesapeake Bay Program. Proposals are evaluated on the basis of appropriateness, clarity of objectives, the plans for achieving the objectives, and the qualifications of the organization for carrying out the project activities.    Funding: Proposals under $1,000 are welcomed throughout the year. However, applications for grants over $1,000 must be received not later than 45 days prior to the next quarterly meeting of the Board of Trustees.    In 1999, Chesapeake Bay Trust announced a special round of funding for ""Year 2000 Chesapeake Bay Restoration and Preservation Projects with High Volunteer Capacity."" Grants of up to $50,000 will be awarded. Projects should result in the restoration or protection of riparian buffers, wetlands, submerged aquatic vegetation and their respective habitats in Maryland. There must be a large number of volunteers involved in these projects.    Project Eligibility: The types of restoration projects eligible for this special grant include:        •Buffer plantings,     •Marsh grass plantings,     •SAV plantings,     •Habitat restoration projects focusing on specific   animal populations,     •Reforestation projects that connect forest   fragments,     •Training projects for community volunteers that   result in specific restoration projects, and     •Innovative projects that result directly in any of   the above.      Types of preservation projects eligible include:        •Projects that facilitate and increase conservation   easements and donations of private land, particularly along permanent streams, and     •Projects to involve communities and volunteers in   preserving riparian areas.      Maryland has an exceptional amount of nonpoint source financial assistance programs to choose from. Without these programs the implementation of nonpoint source control activities or restoration activities would be greatly diminished.

GX013-54-3296578	"flash floods and floods...   the Awesome Power!    A PREPAREDNESS GUIDE   U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service   July 1992   NOAA, FEMA, and The American Red Cross     flash floods   #1 weather-related killer in the United States!   How do flash floods occur?    Several factors contribute to flash flooding. The two key elements are rainfall  intensity and duration. Intensity is the rate of rainfall, and duration is how long the  rain lasts. Topography, soil conditions, and ground cover also play an important  role.   Flash floods occur within a few minutes or hours of excessive rainfall, a dam or  levee failure, or a sudden release of water held by an ice jam. Flash floods can roll  boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings and bridges, and scour out new  channels. Rapidly rising water can reach heights of 30 feet or more. Furthermore,  flash flood-producing rains can also trigger catastrophic mud slides. You will not  always have a warning that these deadly, sudden floods are coming. Most flood  deaths are due to  FLASH FLOODS .   Most flash flooding is caused by slow-moving thunderstorms, thunderstorms  repeatedly moving over the same area, or heavy rains from hurricanes and tropical  storms.   Occasionally, floating debris or ice can accumulate at a natural or man-made  obstruction and restrict the flow of water. Water held back by the ice jam or debris  dam can cause flooding upstream. Subsequent flash flooding can occur  downstream if the obstruction should suddenly release.       June 9, 1972 Black Hills        Rapid City, SD           15 inches of rain in 5 hours           238 fatalities           $164M in damages           Source: National Weather Service             PLAN AHEAD:    Identify where to go if told to evacuate. Choose several places...a friend's home or  a motel in another town, or a shelter.    GO TO HIGHER GROUND!     Know your area's flood risk . For information, call your local National Weather  Service office, Red Cross chapter, or local emergency management agency. Check  your homeowner's or renter's insurance. Homeowners' policies do not cover  flooding. Contact your insurance agent to find out how to get flood insurance.   flooding can occur NATIONWIDE!   Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet, and a depth  of 2 feet will float your car!  NEVER  try to walk, swim, or drive through such  swift water. If you come upon flood waters,  STOP! TURN AROUND AND GO  ANOTHER WAY.   SOME HISTORICAL NWS DATA     Dam Break   May 31, 1889 Johnstown, Pennsylvania...       the worst flood in United States history..    36-40 ft. wall of water...2,200 dead.           River Flood    December 1991/January 1992 South-central Texas...       wide-spread river flooding on the Guadalupe, Brazos, Trinity, and Colorado  River Basins...       up to 17 inches of rain...15 dead...damages $100M.           Flash Flood Events   June 14, 1990 Shadyside, Ohio...       4 inches of rain in less than 2 hours produced a 30-foot high wall of water...       26 dead...damages $6-8M.           August 1, 1985 Cheyenne, Wyoming...       6 inches of rain in 3 hours...       12 dead...damages $61M.           Flooding Takes Many Forms...    Flash flooding occurs within 6 hours of the rain event.    Flooding is a longer term event and may last a week or more.    RIVER FLOOD    Flooding along rivers is a natural and inevitable part of life. Some floods occur  seasonally when winter or spring rains, coupled with melting snows, fill river  basins with too much water, too quickly. Torrential rains from decaying  hurricanes or tropical systems can also produce river flooding.    COASTAL FLOOD    Winds generated from tropical storms and hurricanes or intense offshore low  pressure systems can drive ocean water inland and cause significant flooding.  Escape routes can be cut off and blocked by high water. Coastal flooding can  also be produced by sea waves called tsunamis (tsoo-n„ -m z), sometimes  referred to as tidal waves. These waves are produced by earthquakes or  volcanic activity.    NOTE:  Coastal flooding caused by the storm surge associated with  hurricanes is described in publication NOAA/PA 78019, ""Storm Surge and  Hurric ane Safety.""    URBAN FLOOD    As land is converted from fields or woodlands to roads and parking lots, it loses  its ability to absorb rainfall. Urbanization increases runoff 2 to 6 times over  what would occur on natural terrain. During periods of urban flooding, streets  can become swift moving rivers, while basements can become death traps as  they fill with water.    FLASH FLOODING IN ARROYOS/WASHES    An arroyo is a water-carved gully or normally dry creek bed. Arroyos can fill  with fast-moving water very quickly. Flash flooding at this arroyo in Arizona  took only 58 seconds to develop.    ICE JAM    Floating ice can accumulate at a natural or man-made obstruction and stop the  flow of water.      Environmental Clues...    Listen for.. .      distant thunder runoff from a faraway thunderstorm could be headed your  way.     Look out for.. .      water rising rapidly     Nearly half of all flash flood fatalities are auto related!    In your automobile...       look out for..flooding at highway dips, bridges, and low areas.     MANY FLASH FLOODS OCCUR AT NIGHT...BE PREPARED TO  TAKE QUICK ACTION.      How can a foot or two of water cost you your life?      Water weighs 62.4 lbs. per cubic foot and typically flows downstream at 6  to 12 miles an hour.    When a vehicle stalls in the water, the water's momentum is transferred to  the car. For each foot the water rises, 500 lbs. of lateral force are applied to  the car.    But the biggest factor is buoyancy. For each foot the water rises up the side  of the car, the car displaces 1,500 lbs. of water. In effect, the car weighs  1,500 lbs. less for each foot the water rises.    Two feet of water will carry away most automobiles .       Before the flood...    What  YOU  can do:     Know your flood risk and elevation above flood stage.  - Do your local streams or rivers flood easily? If so, be prepared to move to  a place of safety. Know your evacuation routes.    Keep your automobile fueled; if electric power is cut off, gas stations may  not be able to operate pumps for several days.    Store drinking water in clean bathtubs and in various containers. Water  service may be interrupted.    Keep a stock of food that requires little cooking and no refrigeration;  electric power may be interrupted.    Keep first aid supplies on hand.    Keep a NOAA Weather Radio, a battery-powered portable radio,  emergency cooking equipment, and flashlights in working order. Install  check valves in building sewer traps to prevent flood water from backing up  into the drains of your home.     Assemble a disaster supplies kit containing: first aid kit, canned food and  can opener, bottled water, rubber boots, rubber gloves, NOAA Weather  Radio, battery-powered radio, flashlight, and extra batteries.    What YOUR community can do:      Assist hospitals and other operations which are critically affected by power  failure by arranging for auxiliary power supplies.       River/rainfall readings are valuable to local emergency management agencies  (EMA) and the National Weather Service (NWS) in assessing flood conditions  and taking appropriate actions. Advanced warning provided by early detection  is critical to saving lives. Automatic flood detection systems are available  commercially for flood-prone communities. Contact your local NWS office or  emergency management agency for further information on  LOCAL FLOOD  WARNING SYSTEMS .           STAY INFORMED ABOUT THE STORM    by listening to NOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio, and television for the  latest flash flood/flood  WATCHES, WARNINGS, and ADVISORIES.   NOAA WEATHER RADIO IS THE BEST MEANS TO RECEIVE WARNINGS  FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE.  The National Weather Service  continuously broadcasts updated weather warnings and forecasts that can be  received by NOAA Weather Radios sold in many stores. Average range is 40  miles, depending on topography. Your National Weather Service recommends  purchasing a radio that has both a battery backup and a tone-alert feature  which automatically alerts you when a watch or warning is issued.    What to Listen For...     FLASH FLOOD OR FLOOD WATCH: Flash flooding or flooding is  possible within the designated WATCH area be alert.    FLASH FLOOD OR FLOOD WARNING: Flash flooding or flooding has  been reported or is imminent take necessary precautions at once.    URBAN AND SMALL STREAM ADVISORY: Flooding of small  streams, streets, and low-lying areas, such as railroad underpasses and  urban storm drains, is occurring.    FLASH FLOOD OR FLOOD STATEMENT: Follow-up information  regarding a flash flood/flood event.     The rule for being safe in a flooding situation is simple:  HEAD FOR  HIGHER GROUND AND STAY AWAY FROM FLOOD WATERS!       TAKE ACTION!     When a flash flood  WATCH  is issued Be alert to signs of flash flooding  and be ready to evacuate on a moment's notice.    When a flash flood  WARNING  is issued for your area, or the moment you  realize that a flash flood is imminent, act quickly to save yourself. You may  have only  SECONDS !    Go to higher ground Climb to safety!     Get out of areas subject to flooding. This includes dips, low spots, canyons,  washes, etc.    Avoid already flooded and high velocity flow areas. Do not attempt to cross  flowing streams.    If driving, be aware that the road bed may not be intact under flood waters.  Turn around and go another way. NEVER drive through flooded  roadways!    If the vehicle stalls, leave it immediately and seek higher ground. Rapidly  rising water may engulf the vehicle and its occupants and sweep them away.  Remember, it's better to be wet than dead!    Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood dangers.    Do not camp or park your vehicle along streams and washes, particularly  during threatening conditions.     When you receive a  FLOOD WARNING :     If advised to evacuate, do so immediately.    Move to a safe area before access is cut off by flood water.    continue monitoring NOAA Weather Radio, television, or emergency  broadcast station for information.     During the flood:     Avoid areas subject to sudden flooding.    If you come upon a flowing stream where water is above your ankles,  STOP! Turn around and go another way.    Do not attempt to drive over a flooded road. The depth of water is not  always obvious. The road bed may be washed out under the water, and you  could be stranded or trapped.    Children should NEVER play around high water, storm drains, viaducts, or  arroyos.     After the flood:     If fresh food has come in contact with flood waters, throw it out.    Boil drinking water before using. Wells should be pumped out and the  water tested for purity before drinking. If in doubt, call your local public  health authority.    Seek necessary medical care at the nearest hospital. Food, clothing, shelter,  and first aid are available from the Red Cross.    Do not visit disaster areas. Your presence might hamper rescue and other  emergency operations.    Electrical equipment should be checked and dried before being returned to  service.    Use flashlights, not lanterns, torches or matches, to examine buildings.  Flammables may be inside.    Report broken utility lines to appropriate authorities.        FAMILY DISASTER PLAN    Families should be prepared for all hazards that affect their area. NOAA's  National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and  the American Red Cross urge each family to develop a family disaster plan.    Where will your family be when disaster strikes? They could be anywhere at  work, at school, or in the car. How will you find each other? Will you know if  your children are safe? Disasters may force you to evacuate your neighborhood  or confine you to your home. What would you do if basic services water, gas,  electricity or telephones were cut off?Follow these basic steps to develop a  family disaster plan...     I. Gather information about hazards.  Contact your local National  Weather Service office, emergency management or civil defense office, and  American Red Cross chapter. Find out what type of disasters could occur  and how you should respond. Learn your community's warning signals and  evacuation plans.     II. Meet with your family to create a plan . Discuss the information you  have gathered. Pick two places to meet: a spot outside your home for an  emergency, such as fire, and a place away from your neighborhood in case  you can't return home. Choose an out-of-state friend as your ""family  check-in contact"" for everyone to call if the family gets separated. Discuss  what you would do if advised to evacuate.     III. Implement your plan.   (1) Post emergency telephone numbers by phones;  (2) Install safety features in your house, such as smoke detectors and fire  extinguishers;  (3) Inspect your home for potential hazards (such as items that can  move, fall, break, or catch fire) and correct them;  (4) Have your family learn basic safety measures, such as CPR and first  aid; how to use a fire extinguisher; and how and when to turn off water,  gas, and electricity in your home;  (5) Teach children how and when to call 911 or your local Emergency  Medical Services number;  (6) Keep enough supplies in your home to meet your needs for at least  three days. Assemble a disaster supplies kit with items you may need in  case of an evacuation. Store these supplies in sturdy, easy-to-carry  containers, such as backpacks or duffle bags. Keep important family  documents in a waterproof container. Keep a smaller disaster supplies  kit in the trunk of your car.     A DISASTER SUPPLIES KIT SHOULD INCLUDE:     A 3-day supply of water (one gallon per person per day) and food that  won't spoil    one change of clothing and footwear per person    one blanket or sleeping bag per person    a first aid kit, including prescription medicines    emergency tools, including a battery-powered NOAA Weather Radio  and a portable radio, flashlight, and plenty of extra batteries    an extra set of car keys and a credit card or cash    special items for infant, elderly, or disabled family members.         IV. Practice and maintain your plan . Ask questions to make sure your  family remembers meeting places, phone numbers, and safety rules.  Conduct drills. Test your smoke detectors monthly and change the batteries  at least once a year. Test and recharge your fire extinguisher(s) according to  manufacturer's instructions. Replace stored water and food every six  months.       LOCAL SPONSORSHIP: NOAA/PA 92050 ARC 4493"

Maryland Clean Marinas Underway is a quarterly newsletter published by the Waterway and Greenways Division of the Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service, Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The Maryland Clean Marina Initiative promotes and celebrates voluntary adoption of measures to reduce pollution from marinas and recreational boats. The Initiative is coordinated by DNR in partnership with the marine industry.

""The Clean Marina certification makes a statement about your entire philosophy of doing business. You will be perceived as a company that treats customers and their property in the same fashion that you treat the environment.""  Art Willis, The Sailing Emporium ""The type of clientele we have begun to attract has more than paid for what we had to invest to become a clean marina.""  Clark Lutz, Coltons Point Marina  UNDERW WINTER 2002  Maryland Clean Marinas  AY  If it sounds too good to be true. . . It has come to the attention of the Clean Marina staff that a private consultant is offering to walk marina operators through the Clean Marina certification process. Please be aware that no outside consulting services are necessary with one exception. That exception relates to Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plans. If your marina has the capacity to store 660 gallons of petroleum in a single above ground tank, an aggregate of 1,320 gallons above ground or 42,000 below ground, then federal law requires that your marina have an SPCC plan. The plan must be certified by a professional engineer. The Clean Marina Initiative has hired the firm of Purdum and Jeschke to certify SPCC plans at no cost to marinas. To take advantage of this service, you must sign the Clean Marina Pledge and submit a completed copy of the Clean Marina Award Checklist to DNR. Be wary of any consultant that offers to ""get you certified."" A vendor with no connection to DNR simply does not have the depth of knowledge nor the authority to advise marinas with regard to Clean Marina certification. Clean Marina staff and committee members, on the other hand, are readily available to guide you toward Clean Marina status. Templates for commonly needed plans have been developed, educational materials for marina staff and customers have been produced, and Clean Marina staff are happy to make informal assessments of how well your marina meets the Clean Marina criteria. And these services are free! Call the Clean Marina office at 410-260-8770 for more information. ]  BMP Spotlight: Handle Solvents Appropriately The ""BMP Spotlight"" is intended to help marina operators understand what the Clean Marina staff are looking for when visiting a marina. Items are drawn directly from the Clean Marina Award Checklist and the Maryland Clean Marina Guidebook. The question for this issue is, ""Do you handle solvents appropriately?"" That is, do you store, use and dispose of hazardous products in a safe and environmentally-responsible manner? Hazardous materials include acetone, solvent-based paints, and paint thinners. They are considered hazardous because they are ignitable, corrosive, reactive and/or toxic. The State Fire Marshall's Office has adopted the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards as the state fire code. In particular, NFPA standard 230 relates to the storage of flammable liquids and standard 30 relates to flammable and combustible liquids.  4  S  TORAGE  Maryland Clean Marina Initiative 580 Taylor Avenue, E-2 Annapolis, MD 21401  INSIDE T  HIS ISSUE  ...  Private Consultants Not Able to Certify Marinas 1 BMP Spotlight: Handle Solvents Appropriately 1 Renewal of General Permit for Discharges from Marinas 2 Community Right-to-Know Requirements 2 Upcoming Clean Marina Workshops 2 New Certified Clean Marinas 3 Why Become a Clean Marina? 4  A cursory review of the standards indicates that all hazardous liquids should be stored in the containers in which they are purchased. According to the State Fire Marshall's Office, it is not critical that a facility with a small quantity of hazardous materiala couple small cans and one drum, for instancehave a fire proof container. Fire Marshalls expect materials to be properly marked and reasonably neat, however. Marinas with larger quantities should store their flammable liquids in a fire-safe container. No more than one drum of a particular flammable liquid should be in the work area at one time. Multiple drums are allright as long as each contains a different chemical. Additional drums of hazardous products should be kept in a specially designed outbuilding. Following these storage guidelines will protect marina staff from accidental exposure to dangerous chemicals. It can also save the marina money. A fire marshal can cite a facility for breach of the fire code. Also, in the event of a fire, many insurance companies will not pay claims to a facility that did not meet the fire code. To determine whether or not your marina is in compliance with the state fire code, call the State Fire Marshall's Office at 800-525-3124 or 410-339-4200. Tell the person that answers that you want to schedule a ""basic fire inspection"" and he or she will refer you to the proper regional office. continued on page 2  1   Clean Marina Workshops The Maryland Clean Marina Initiative will be sponsoring four workshops this winter. The focus will be on ""removing stumbling blocks to Clean Marina certification."" Over the first three years of the program, Clean Marina staff identified several items on the checklist that marina operators frequently lack. These items include Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans; Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plans; emergency response plans; and employee training. During the workshops, Clean Marina staff will lead attendees through preparation of these various plans. Staff will also discuss how to structure employee training. Participants will leave with thorough drafts of each of these plans, materials to help guide employee training, and a clear understanding of what additional work, if any, is needed to meet the Clean Marina criteria. Tentative dates for the workshops are January 29 and 31 and February 5 and 7. Look for an invitation in the mail soon! Hazardous Products, continued from page 1  MARINAS WITH FUEL DOCKS MAY BE REQUIRED TO F ANNUAL HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL INVENTORY  ILE  THE S  AILING EMPORIUM AND POINT PATIENCE MARINA ARE CERTIFIED CLEAN MARINAS  !  Marinas with the capacity to store greater than 1,250 gallons of gasoline or diesel must submit a ""Tier Two Report"" to state and local emergency planning organizations. This filing requirement is an element of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). EPCRA was the United States' congressional response to serious chemical incidents that occurred in Bhopal, India and Institute, West Virginia in the two years prior to its enactment in 1986. The incident in Bhopal resulted in 2,000 immediate fatalities. While the accident in West Virginia caused no fatalities, the circumstances were similar and aroused concerns. EPCRA requires each state to:    establish a state emergency response commission (SERC), designate local emergency planning districts, and appoint a local emergency planning committee (LEPC) for each district.  U  SE AND  To minimize risk and hassles, order only as much product as can be used in a short period of time, e.g., one to two months. The Maryland Clean Marina Guidebook offers these additional suggestions:  Cap solvents and paint thinners whenever not in use to minimize air pollution.  Use only one cleaning solvent to simplify disposal.  Use only the minimal amount of solvent (stripper, thinner, etc.) needed for a given job.  For small jobs, pour the needed solvent into a small container in order not to contaminate a large amount of solvent.  Allow solids to settle from used strippers and thinners so you can reuse solvents.  Store waste solvents and rags in covered, UL-listed or Factory Mutual-approved containers.  Hire a licensed waste hauler to recycle or dispose of used solvents. Refer to pages 32, 54 and 58 of the Guidebook for further information about storage and use of hazardous products. Pages 59-62 summarize ""recommended disposal methods"" for a variety of wastes typically found at marinas. ]  D  ISPOSAL  Industries are required to provide the government with information about their activities with hazardous and toxic chemicals. The SERC and the LEPCs use the information in their emergency planning and make it available to the public. To comply with this regulation, marina operators who exceed the 1,250 gallon threshold simply submit a one-time notification letter to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and an annual Tier Two reporting form by March 1 of each year. The reporting form is available from MDE at www.mde.state.md.us/pia/fs_epcra.htm or 410-631-3800. The completed form should be submitted to MDE, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the local fire department if different from the LEPC. A list of emergency planning committee chairpersons, arranged by county, is also available from MDE. Additional information, including frequently asked questions, fact sheets, and guidance are available from the Environmental Protection Agency: www.epa.gov/swercepp/ep-epre.htm. ]  With the certifications of The Sailing Emporium in Rock Hall and Point Patience Marina in Solomons, the total number of Clean Marinas has increased to 36. Two state parks have also recently been certified as Clean Marina Partners, bringing that total to 8. ""We take pride in doing the `right' thing,"" said Sailing Emporium President Art Willis. ""We want to meet legal requirements and, more importantly, protect the resources that support boating in Maryland."" The Sailing Emporium is a family owned and operated marina in Rock Hall Harbor. Mary Sue Willis, wife and coowner, has made a personal commitment, which is apparent when walking around the impeccably clean and beautifully landscaped grounds. Over the years, the inherited, dilapidated remnants of previous ownerships have been replaced with elements of design that are functional, attractive and emphasize a clean Chesapeake Bay. Most recently a 200Art Willis. president foot wooden, collapsed bulkhead was replaced Emporium, with his with rip rap, providing better habitat for aquatic certificate. species. The Sailing Emporium is a working boat yard with 25 employees and is managed to minimize pollution. Outside contractors are required to clean up all trash, dust and other debris resulting from work. Point Patience Marina is part of Naval District Washington's Solomons Recreation Complex, a recreation area for U.S. military personnel. The Navy is entrusted with protecting our nation's interests and this responsibility encompasses issues from national security to water quality. In order to minimize environmental impacts from this recreational site, Marina Manager John Kenny  keeps close tabs on all hazardous products and uses the least toxic options available. He also maintains 5,000 feet of boom at the ready in the event of a large fuel spill. Patrons are asked to do their share as well. For instance, on-water maintenance is prohibited and boaters are advised to follow a series of clean boating tips. Susquehanna State Park was certified as a Clean Marina Partner in October. The park's year-round boating facility, Lapidum Boat Ramp, is on the Susquehanna River about three miles north of Havre de Grace. Visitors to the boat ramp will find educational signs and composting toilets. The park managers' environmental stewardship efforts are not limited to the shoreline. For example, they collect plastic and aluminum from campers for recycling, practice ""no-till"" farming on hay fields, and avoid the use of toxic lawn and garden chemicals. of The Sailing New Germany State Park in Grantsville Clean Marina was certified as a Partner several weeks later. New Germany State Park lies within the boundaries of Savage River State Forest. The park features a 13-acre lake that was created when Poplar Lick Run was dammed for mill operation in the mid-nineteenth century. Today the lake is open to non-motorized craft, such as canoes, kayaks and rowboats. To maintain the natural resources of the area, park manager Michael Gregory insists that staff minimize the use of pesticides; recycle used oil, antifreeze, paper, and aluminum; and fuel the park's rescue boat while the boat is on a trailer away from the water. ]  Certified Clean Marinas ANCHOR BAY EAST MARINA, DUNDALK BALTIMORE YACHT CLUB, BALTIMORE BAY RIDGE CIVIC ASSN.

The one significant change is that marina operators will now be able to treat and discharge oily bilge water as long as the oil and grease concentrations within the discharge are below 15 mg/l. Properly operating oil-water separators should easily provide this level of treatment.

We've made  a list  of some places on our website and other     websites to check.        Q. I need to do a report on an oil spill other than the Exxon Valdez (my     teacher says it's too popular!). Can you please tell me where I can get information about other important oil     spills?        A. In the  Historical Incidents     database  on our Incident News website, you'll find information about many significant oil spills worldwide. Our     photo gallery also features  photos of major oil spills , along with a little information about each of those spills. In addition, you can read or download  reports describing oil and chemical spills  that we responded to between October, 1992 and September, 1999. You may also want to view our  Oil Spill Case Histories  document ( PDF  file; 2.2 MB), which summarizes significant U.S. and international spills between 1967 and 1991.        Elsewhere on the Web, you can see the U.S. Coast Guard  Annual Data and Graphics  on spills in the U.S., Environment Canada's  Summaries of Spill Events in Canada  and its worldwide  Tanker Spills database , the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's list,  Major Oil Spills in Australia , and the University of Wales Swansea website about the 1996  Sea Empress Oil Spill in Wales.  You also can find information about  major oil spills in France  on the CEDRE website, including the Erika and Amoco Cadiz spills in Brittany, as well as brief descriptions of significant oil spills worldwide since 1967. The  International Tanker Owners Federation (ITOPF)  offers updates on current major spills, as well as links to online  Oil Spill Case History information . For more information, we     suggest extending your information search to your local city or university library.        Q. Where in the world do most oil spills happen?        A. Oil spills happen all around the world. Analysts for the  Oil Spill Intelligence Report  [Aspen Publishers website ],  who track oil spills of at least 10,000 gallons (34 tons), reported that spills in that size range have occurred in the waters of 112 nations since 1960. But they also reported (Etkin 1997) that oil spills happen more frequently in certain parts of the world. They identified the following ""hot spots"" for oil spills from vessels: the Gulf of Mexico (267 spills); the northeastern U.S. (140 spills); the Mediterranean Sea (127 spills); the Persian Gulf (108 spills); the North Sea (75 spills); Japan (60 spills); the Baltic Sea (52 spills); the United Kingdom and English Channel (49 spills); Malaysia and Singapore (39 spills); the west coast of France and north and west coasts of Spain (33 spills); and Korea (32 spills).     Also, U.S. Coast Guard analysts have prepared some  graphs and charts  that show the frequencies of oil     spills in different regions of the U.S. and its coastal zone.     Reference:  Etkin, D.S. 1997. Oil Spills From Vessels (1960-1995): An     International Historical Perspective. ISBN 1-57484-044-4. Cambridge, MA: Cutter Information Corporation. 72 pp.     Q. Do most oil spills originate from tankers?        A. Information from several sources tells us that the answer to your question is: No, as long as     you consider spills of all sizes. But tanker accidents have accounted for most of the world's largest oil spills.     They are less frequent than other kinds of oil spills, such as pipeline breaks, but typically involve large volumes     of spilled oil relative to other kinds of oil spills.        Here are some sources of information on this topic:        Analysts for the  Oil Spill Intelligence Report  [Aspen Publishers website] track oil spills of at least 10,000 gallons (34 tons). In their annual ""International Oil Spill Statistics"" report for 1999, they reported that in that year--the latest year for which they have analyzed data--about 32 million gallons of oil spilled into the water or onto land, in 257 incidents. Of those incidents, only 11 were spills from tankers, accounting for about 6.6 million gallons, or about one-fifth of the total volume of oil spilled. Twenty-five of the 257 spills were from barges and other kinds of vessels, such as freighters (totaling 1.5 million gallons). Eighteen spills were from trucks or railroad trains (totaling about half a million gallons). The largest number of spills, and the largest volume of oil spilled were from accidents involving pipelines or fixed facilities (131 pipeline spills, totaling about 18.8 million gallons; 66 spills from facilities, totaling about 4.7 million gallons). The percentages of oil spilled from different sources vary greatly from year to year; in some years, tanker accidents represent the largest single source of spilled oil, but only in a very few years is it the case that most of the oil spilled (in significant spills) during that year came from tankers. DeCola (2000) presents a graph showing the volume of oil spilled from various sources, including tankers, from 1978 to 1992.        However, tanker accidents have been the cause of most of the very largest oil spills.  Cutter Information Corporation  [Aspen Publishers website] analysts also have found that of the 66 spills in which at least 10 million gallons (34,000 tonnes) of oil were lost, 48 were from tankers. Eight were from fixed facilities, especially storage tanks, five were from production oil wells, three were from pipelines, and two were from other kinds of cargo vessels.        Note that the above statistics are only for relatively large oil spills. Researchers from NASA     and the Smithsonian Institution have estimated the amounts of oil that spill from small and large sources. Their  oil pollution graph  shows that     much more oil is estimated to spill into the water from small sources than from major accidents. They also estimate     that  just 5% of the oil that spills     into the ocean  comes from major oil spills. Check the  State of Alaska's list of recent     spills  to see that most accidental oil spills are much smaller than the major incidents that you hear about on     the news.        You can see some more oil spill statistics at the  International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation website .        Reference:  DeCola, E. 2000. International Oil Spill Statistics: 2000.     Arlington, MA: Cutter Information Corporation.        Q. What was the biggest oil spill in the world? Where and when did it     happen, and what were its consequences?        According to the  Oil Spill Intelligence Report  [Aspen Publishers website], the biggest so far was the Arabian (Persian) Gulf spill in 1991. You can find very good overviews of the effects of that spill in the August 1991 and February 1992 issues of National Geographic magazine.        Q. When was the first oil spill in the United States?                A. Perhaps no one knows for sure just when the first U.S. spill happened. Here are some suggested       possibilities from our oil spill experts:                    Oil from natural seeps was in the water before the first spills from oil production. In the early 1500s, the Portuguese-born explorer  Juan Cabrillo  [National Park Service website] sailed into what is now Santa Barbara, California, and remarked on the oil he saw bubbling out from a natural seep. He reported that the Chumash Indians scooped and skimmed up the oil, which they used to waterproof their boats.            The first oil well in the U.S. was drilled in 1859 in an area of natural oil seeps along Oil Creek, near Titusville, Pennsylvania. It's possible--although we don't know for sure--that the first oil spills from oil production may have occurred when crude oil was first transported from this well.            The U.S. Fish Commission (NOAA's precursor) steamer  Albatross  reported a         massive oil slick extending from L.A. south to northern San Diego County around 1889 or 1890. We don't know the         source of this slick.            In the late 19-teens, hopane, a chemical ""signal"" of spilled oil, began appearing in the sediments of Puget         Sound, Washington State, indicating that oil had been spilled into the Sound. Hopane's appearance peaked during         WWII and has since been slowly declining.            After passage of federal legislation in 1925, the California Fish and Game Department began a major effort         to reduce spills and leakages from coastal oil drilling operations in California, which then were common. In         1929, for example, a 600-barrel spill covered 9 miles of Ventura County Beach. By 1930, spills from ships were         considered a greater menace than shoreline leakage.                  Our thanks to Gary J. Green for help with this question. If you discover more clues to help answer it, please let our webmaster ( ) know!              Q. I'd like some information about an oil (or chemical) spill that happened     recently in my state (within the U.S.). Where can I go for that information?        A. Check with the Regional Response Team (RRT) for your region. Within each region of the U.S., the RRT is responsible for planning and coordinating regional preparedness and responses to oil and hazardous materials releases. To find the RRT for your region, visit the  U.S. National Response Team (NRT) website . Scroll down the page and click the ""Regional Response Teams"" link. On the map, click within the appropriate region to link to your RRT's website.        Also, your state's environmental agency also may track spills in your state. To find a point of contact, visit your state's website (the Library of Congress keeps  a list of all state government websites ), and look for the link to your state's environmental agency (if you know its name), or for a keyword like ""environment."" (Example environmental agency names are the Washington Department of Ecology and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality.)

GX269-57-13695038	BACKGROUNDER FLOODS AND FLASH FLOODS EMERGENCY INFORMATION 1. Flood waters can be extremely dangerous. The force of six inches of swiftly moving water can easily knock people off their feet and carry them away. The best protection during a flood is to leave the area and go to shelter on higher ground. 2. Flash flood waters move at very fast speeds and can roll boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings, and obliterate bridges. Walls of water can reach heights of 10 to 20 feet and generally are accompanied by trees, rocks, and other debris. The best response to any signs of flash flooding is to move immediately and quickly to higher ground. 3. Cars can easily be swept away in just two feet of moving water. If flood waters rise around a car, it should be abandoned. Passengers should climb immediately to higher ground.  WHAT IS A FLOOD? Floods are the most common and widespread of all natural disasters  except fire. Most communities in the United States can experience some kind of flooding after spring rains, heavy thunderstorms, or spring thaws. Floods can be slow- or fast-rising, but generally develop over a period of days. Dam failures are potentially the worst flash flood events. A dam failure is usually the result of neglect, poor design, or structural damage caused by a major event such as an earthquake. When a dam fails, a gigantic quantity of water is suddenly let loose downstream, destroying anything in its path.  DANGER ZONES  WHAT IS A FLASH FLOOD? According to the National Weather Service, flash flooding is a rapid rise in water levels associated with heavy rainfall Floods and flash floods occur within all 50 states. Communities particularly at risk are those located in low-lying areas, near water, or downstream from a dam. or the failure of a dam or ice jam.  The United States supports international efforts to raise awareness that natural risks can be managed: Federal Emergency Management Agency, American Red Cross, National Weather Service, U. S. Geological Survey, Department of Energy, Corporation for National Service, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Small Business Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Department of Transportation, Department of Education, and the National Interagency Fire Center.   HELP YOUR COMMUNITY GET READY The media can raise awareness about floods and flash floods by providing important information to the community. Here are some suggestions: 1. Publish a special section in your local newspaper with emergency information on floods and flash floods. Localize the information by describing recent or past floods in your area and printing the phone numbers of local emergency services offices, the American Red Cross, and the nearest hospitals. 2. Interview local officials about land use management and building codes in floodplains. 3. Work with the National Weather Service, local emergency services and American Red Cross officials to find out what you can do before a flood or flash flood occurs. 4. Periodically inform your community of local public warning systems.  HOW THE PUBLIC CAN HELP AFTER A DISASTER When disaster strikes, people everywhere want to help those in need. To ensure that this compassion and generosity are put to good use, the media can highlight these facts:  Financial aid is an immediate need of disaster victims. Financial contributions should be made through a recognized voluntary organization to help ensure that contributions are put to their intended use.  Before donating food or clothing, wait for instructions from local officials. Immediately after a disaster, relief workers usually don't have the time or facilities to set up distribution channels, and too often these items go to waste.  Volunteers should go through a recognized voluntary agency such as the American Red Cross or the Salvation Army. They know what is needed and are prepared to deal with the need. Local emergency services officials also coordinate volunteer efforts for helping in a disaster.  DID YOU KNOW...  Individuals and business owners can protect themselves from flood losses by purchasing flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program. Homeowners policies do not cover flood damage. Information is available through local insurance agents and emergency offices. Flooding has caused the deaths of more than 10,000 people since 1900. Property damage from flooding now totals over $3.5 billion each year in the United States. More than 2,200 lives were lost as a result of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania, flood of 1889. This flood was caused by an upstream dam failure.  Seventy-five percent of presidential disaster declarations result from natural phenomena in which flooding was a major component. On July 31, 1976, the Big Thompson River near Denver overflowed after an extremely heavy storm. A wall of water 19 feet high roared down the Big Thompson Canyon, where many people were camping. One hundred forty people perished and millions of dollars worth of property was lost.
GX267-63-9586875	"Fact Sheet COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA  DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION  DAMS, ENCROACHMENTS AND WATER OBSTRUCTIONS WHY PERMITS ARE NEEDED  HISTORICAL REFERENCE: 4:10 to 4:17 p.m., May 31, 1889, Johnstown, Pennsylvania: "" the deserted streets became black with people. An instant later the flood came and lapped them up with one eager and ferocious lap. The whole city was one surging and whirling mass of water. . ."" -- The Johnstown Flood, by Edward Oxford. Perched safely on one of the surrounding hillsides, this was one man's recollection of what he witnessed in Johnstown that fateful day. Spawned by the collapse of the South Fork Dam located about 14 ""stream miles"" upstream of the city, 20 million tons of water and a 100,000 tons of flood debris swept over Johnstown like a giant avalanche. Approximately 1,500 houses were destroyed, almost all of the factories and businesses were either destroyed or rendered inoperative, and worst of all, over 2,000 people were killed. At the city's eastern edge, a grotesque 30foot high wall of flood debris lodged against the big stone railroad bridge. Likely set on fire by live coals from stoves, fire broke out in this wreckage killing some 80 of the approximately 600 people who had been swept into the pile. At the time of the Johnstown flood disaster, the South Fork Dam was owned by the ""South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club"" whose 61 members included most of Pittsburgh's wealthy aristocrats of business and industry. Previously in 1862, spring runoff washed out a 200-foot section of the dam embankment leaving the dam high and almost dry. The next owner removed the dam's cast iron discharge pipes leaving a 274foot ""hole"" through the dam base. Finally, in 1879 the dam was purchased by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club which then spent the grand sum of $12,000 to restore the dam. A professional engineer was never consulted during the restoration process. Instead, a ""muleskinner"" was hired to do the work which did not include replacing the discharge pipes. The club undertook additional work, such as lowering the top of the dam and placing a metal screen across the spillway to prevent the loss of fish, both of which further reduced the structure's ability to withstand a major flood. Despite the complaints of many downstream residents and officials, the club did not correct these problems and in 1881, no state or federal laws existed to require these corrections.  REACTION Despite the magnitude of the Johnstown disaster, and the occurrence of over 20 additional dam failures in the next 22 years, it was not until the occurrence of another ""major"" dam failure flood event that the state government began to regulate the design and construction of dams and other water control structures. On September 30, 1911, a 50foot high concrete gravity dam located above the Borough of   Austin in Potter County suddenly gave way sending a wall of water downstream into the Borough and killing 80 people. Finally, in 1913, the Water Obstructions Act (Act of June 25, 1913, P.L. 555) was passed, empowering the Water Supply Commission of Pennsylvania to regulate the design, construction and maintenance of dams and other water obstructions. The title of the 1913 Water Obstructions Act reads as follows: An act providing for the regulation of dams, or other structures or obstructions, as defined herein, in, along, across, or projecting into all streams and bodies of water wholly or partially within, or forming part of the boundary of, this Commonwealth; vesting certain powers and duties in the Water Supply Commission of Pennsylvania, for this purpose; and providing penalties for the violation of the provisions hereof,"" One of the most important provisions of this act was power given to the Water Supply Commission to investigate the condition of existing dams and other water obstructions and, if the structure was found to be unsafe, require the owner to repair or remove it. If the owner could not be found, or refused the commission's instructions to repair/remove, the commission had the power to directly repair or remove the unsafe structure and recover the cost of said operations from the owner.  2. Assure proper planning, design, construction, maintenance, monitoring and supervision of dams and reservoirs, including such preventative measures as are necessary to provide an adequate margin of safety. 3. Protect the natural resources, environmental rights and values secured by the Pennsylvania Constitution and conserve the water quality, natural regime and carrying capacity of watercourses. 4. Assure proper planning, design, construction, maintenance and monitoring of water obstructions and encroachments, in order to prevent unreasonable interference with waterflow and to protect navigation. Today, the construction, operation, maintenance, modification, enlargement and abandonment of dams, bridges, culverts, levees, docks and other encroachments are reviewed and monitored by the Department of Environmental Protection. By requiring permits for new construction activities, the Department can review the design, construction methods, materials and sizing of these proposed projects to ensure public safety and environmental protection. Likewise, requirements for project inspection by their owners and an active program of independent Departmental inspections helps ensure that the ""Great Johnstown Flood of 1889"" will never be repeated because of human indifference. FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:  CURRENT PROGRAM STATUS Since the original ""Water Obstruction Act"" was passed in 1913, several pieces of amending legislation have been passed. The most significant, was the passage of the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act, Act of November 26, 1978, P.L. 1375. No. 325. Under this legislation, the Department of Environmental Protection was empowered to administer a regulatory program to meet the following purposes of the Act: 1. Provide for the regulation of dams and reservoirs, water obstructions and encroachments in the Commonwealth, in order to protect life, health, safety and welfare of the people and property.

GX264-05-11102577	"FACT  SHEET  Federal Emergency Management Agency  FLOODS AND FLASH FLOODS Mitigation pays. It includes any activities that prevent an emergency, reduce the chance of an emergency happening, or lessen the damaging effects of unavoidable emergencies. Investing in mitigation steps now such as constructing barriers such as levees and purchasing flood insurance will help reduce the amount of structural damage to your home and financial loss from building and crop damage should a flood or flash flood occur.  BEFORE  Find out if you live in a floodprone area from your local emergency management office or Red Cross chapter. Ask whether your property is above or below the flood stage water level and learn about the history of flooding for your region. Learn flood warning signs and your community alert signals. Request information on preparing for floods and flash floods.  This plan should include information on the safest routes to shelters. Individuals living in flash flood areas should have several alternate routes.  Make sure that all family members know how to -respond after a flood or flash flood. Teach all family members how and when to turn off gas, electricity, and water. Teach children how and when to call 9-1-1, police, fire department, and which radio station to tune to for emergency information.  Have disaster supplies on hand.  Flashlights and extra batteries  Portable, battery-operated radio and extra batteries  First aid kit and manual  Emergency food and water  Nonelectric can opener  Essential medicines  Cash and credit cards  Sturdy shoes  Learn about the National Flood Insurance Program. Ask your insurance agent about flood insurance. Homeowners policies do not cover flood damage.  If you live in a frequently flooded area, stockpile emergency building materials. These include plywood, plastic sheeting, lumber nails, hammer and saw, pry bar, shovels, and sandbags.  DURING  Develop an emergency communication plan. In case family members are separated from one another during floods or flash floods (a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and children are at school), have a plan for getting back together. Ask an out-of-state relative or friend to serve as the ""family contact."" After a disaster, it's often easier to call long distance. Make sure everyone in the family knows the name, address, and phone number of the contact person.  DURING A FLOOD WATCH s  Have check valves installed in building sewer traps to prevent flood waters from backing up in sewer drains. As a last resort, use large corks or stoppers to plug showers, tubs, or basins.  Listen to a battery-operated radio for the latest storm information. Fill bathtubs, sinks, and jugs with clean water in case water becomes contaminated. Bring outdoor belongings, such as patio furniture, indoors. Move valuable household possessions to the upper floors or to safe ground if time permits. If you are instructed to do so by local authorities, turn off all utilities at the main power switch and close the main gas valve. Be prepared to evacuate.  s  s  s  Plan and practice an evacuation route. Contact the local emergency management office or local American Red Cross chapter for a copy of the community flood evacuation plan.  s  s   AFTER  DURING  DURING A FLOOD  If Indoors: s Turn on battery-operated radio or television to get the latest emergency information. s Get your preassembed emergency supplies. s If told to leave, do so immediately.  Flood dangers do not end when the water begins to recede. Listen to a radio or television and don't return home until authorities indicate it is safe to do so. Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance -- infants, elderly people, and people with disabilities. Inspect foundations for cracks or other damage. Stay out of buildings if flood waters remain around the building. When entering buildings, use extreme caution. s  Throw away food -- including canned goods -- that has come in contact with flood waters. Pump out flooded basements gradually (about one-third of the water per day) to avoid structural damage. Service damaged septic tanks, cesspools, pits, and leaching systems as soon as possible. Damaged sewage systems are health hazards. Inspecting Utilities in a Damaged Home Check for gas leaks -- If you smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window and quickly leave the building. Turn off the gas at the outside main valve if you can and call the gas company from a neighbor's home. If you turn off the gas for any reason, it must be turned back on by a professional. Look for electrical system damage -- If you see sparks or broken or frayed wires, or if you smell hot insulation, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you have to step in water to get to the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician first for advice. Check for sewage and water lines damage -- If you suspect sewage lines are damaged, avoid using the toilets and call a plumber. If water pipes are damaged, contact the water company and avoid using water from the tap. You can obtain safe water by melting ice cubes.  If Outdoors: s Climb to high ground and stay there.  Avoid walking through any floodwaters. If it is moving swiftly, even water 6 inches deep can sweep you off your feet. s  If In a Car: If you come to a flooded area, turn around and go another way. s s If your car stalls, abandon it immediately and climb to higher ground. Many deaths have resulted from attempts to move stalled vehicles.  Wear sturdy shoes and use battery-powered lanterns or flashlights when examining buildings. Examine walls, floors, doors, and windows to make sure that the building is not in danger of collapsing. Watch out for animals, especially poisonous snakes, that may have come into your home with the flood waters. Use a stick to poke through debris. Watch for loose plaster and ceilings that could fall. Take pictures of the damage -- both to the house and its contents for insurance claims.  s  s  DURING AN EVACUATION s If advised to evacuate, do so immediately. s Evacuation is much simpler and safer before flood waters become too deep for ordinary vehicles to drive through. s Listen to a battery-operated radio for evacuation instructions. s Follow recommended evacuation routes -- shortcuts may be blocked.  s  s  Look for fire hazards.  Broken or leaking gas lines  Flooded electrical circuits  Submerged furnaces or electrical appliances  Flammable or explosive materials coming from upstream  Leave early enough to avoid being marooned by flooded roads. s  EMERGENCY PUBLIC INFORMATION  September 1993   BACKGROUNDER  FLOODS AND FLASH FLOODS EMERGENCY INFORMATION  WHAT IS A FLOOD?  Floods are the most common and widespread of all natural disasters-- except fire. Most communities in the United States can experience some kind of flooding after spring rains, heavy thunderstorms, or winter snow thaws. Floods can be slow, or fast rising but generally develop over a period of days. Dam failures are potentially the worst flood events. A dam failure is usually the result of neglect, poor design, or structural damage caused by a major event such as an earthquake. When a dam fails, a gigantic quantity of water is suddenly let loose downstream, destroying anything in its path.  1. Flood waters can be extremely dangerous. The force of six inches of swiftly moving water can knock people off their feet. The best protection during a flood is to leave the area and go to shelter on higher ground. 2. Flash flood waters move at very fast speeds and can roll boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings, and obliterate bridges. Walls of water can reach heights of 10 to 20 feet and generally are accompanied by a deadly cargo of debris. The best response to any signs of flash flooding is to move immediately and quickly to higher ground. 3. Cars can easily be swept away in just 2 feet of moving water. If flood waters rise around a car, it should be abandoned. Passengers should climb immediately to higher ground.  WHAT IS A FLASH FLOOD?  Flash floods usually result from intense storms dropping large amounts of rain within a brief period.  Floods and flash floods occur within all 50 states. Communities particularly at risk are those located in low-lying areas, near water, or downstream from a dam.  Flash floods occur with little or no warning and can reach full peak in only a few minutes.   HELP YOUR COMMUNITY GET READY The media can raise awareness about floods and flash floods by providing important information to the community. Here are some suggestions: 1. Publish a special section in your local newspaper with  HOW T HE PUB LIC C AN HE LP AFT E R A DISAS T E R  emergency information on floods and flash floods. Localize the information by printing the phone numbers of local emergency services offices, the American Red Cross, and hospitals. 2.

To ensure that this compassion and generosity are put to good use, the media can highlight these facts:  building codes in floodplains. Work with local emergency services and American Red Cross officials to prepare special reports for people with mobility impairments on what to do if an evacuation is ordered. 4. Periodically inform your community of local public warning 3.  systems.  Financial aid is an immediate need of disaster victims. Financial contributions should be made through a recognized voluntary organization to help ensure that contributions are put to their intended use. Before donating food or clothing, wait for instructions from local officials. Immediately after a disaster, relief workers usually don't have the time or facilities to set-up distribution channels, and too often these items go to waste. Volunteers should go through a recognized voluntary agency such as the American Red Cross or Salvation Army. They know what is needed and are prepared to deal with the need. Local emergency services officials also coordinate volunteer efforts for helping in disasters. Organizations and community groups wishing to donate items should first contact local officials, the American Red Cross, or Salvation Army to find out what is needed and where to send it. Be prepared to deliver the items to one place, tell officials when you'll be there, and provide for transportation, driver, and unloading.

EP M AR OM TME NT OF C  July 1992  ER CE   flash floods How do flash floods occur? Several factors contribute to flash flooding. The two key elements are rainfall intensity and duration. Intensity is the rate of rainfall, and duration is how long the rain lasts. Topography, soil conditions, and ground cover also play an important role. Flash floods occur within a few minutes or hours of excessive rainfall, a dam or levee failure, or a sudden release of water held by an ice jam. Flash floods can roll boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings and bridges, and scour out new channels. Rapidly rising water can reach heights of 30 feet or more. Furthermore, flash flood-producing rains can also trigger catastrophic mud slides. You will not always have a warning that these deadly, sudden floods are coming. Most flood deaths are due to FLASH FLOODS. Most flash flooding is caused by slow-moving thunderstorms, thunderstorms repeatedly moving over the same area, or heavy rains from hurricanes and tropical storms. Occasionally, floating debris or ice can accumulate at a natural or man-made obstruction and restrict the flow of water. Water held back by the ice jam or debris dam can cause flooding upstream. Subsequent flash flooding can occur downstream if the obstruction should suddenly release.  #1 weather-related killer in the United States!

Flooding is a longer term event and may last a week or more. v Red River near Pineville, LA  RIVER FLOOD Flooding along rivers is a natural and inevitable part of life. Some floods occur seasonally when winter or spring rains, coupled with melting snows, fill river basins with too much water, too quickly. Torrential rains from decaying hurricanes or tropical systems can also produce river flooding.  v Tom Herde, Boston Globe (Nantasket Beach, Hull, MA)  COASTAL FLOOD Winds generated from tropical storms and hurricanes or intense offshore low pressure systems can drive ocean water inland and cause significant flooding. Escape routes can be cut off and blocked by high water. Coastal flooding can also be produced by sea waves called tsunamis (tsoo-n-mez), sometimes referred to as tidal waves. These waves are produced by earthquakes or volcanic activity. NOTE: Coastal flooding caused by the storm surge associated with hurricanes is described in publication NOAA/PA 78019, ""Storm Surge and Hurricane Safety.""  v David Vann, The Sentinel-Record  URBAN FLOOD As land is converted from fields or woodlands to roads and parking lots, it loses its ability to absorb rainfall. Urbanization increases runoff 2 to 6 times over what would occur on natural terrain. During periods of urban flooding, streets can become swift moving rivers, while basements can become death traps as they fill with water.   Many Forms... v  FLASH FLOODING IN ARROYOS/WASHES An arroyo is a water-carved gully or normally dry creek bed. Arroyos can fill with fast-moving water very quickly. Flash flooding at this arroyo in Arizona took only 58 seconds to develop.

In your automobile,  look out for... flooding at highway dips, bridges, and low areas.  MANY FLASH FLOODS OCCUR AT NIGHT... BE PREPARED TO TAKE QUICK ACTION.   Clues...  How can a foot or two of water cost you your life?  Water weighs 62.4 lbs. per cubic foot and typically flows downstream at 6 to 12 miles an hour.  When a vehicle stalls in the water, the water's momentum is transferred to the car. For each foot the water rises, 500 lbs. of lateral force are applied to the car.  But foot car the the  the biggest factor is buoyancy. For each the water rises up the side of the car, the displaces 1,500 lbs. of water. In effect, car weighs 1,500 lbs. less for each foot water rises.  Two feet of water will carry away most automobiles.   Before the flood... What YOU can do:  Know your flood risk and elevation above flood stage. -- Do your local streams or rivers flood easily? If so, be prepared to move to a place of safety. Know your evacuation routes.  Keep your automobile fueled; if electric power is cut off, gas stations may not be able to operate pumps for several days.  Store drinking water in clean bathtubs and in various containers. Water service may be interrupted.  Keep a stock of food that requires little cooking and no refrigeration; electric power may be interrupted.  Keep first aid supplies on hand.  Keep a NOAA Weather Radio, a battery-powered portable radio, emergency cooking equipment, and flashlights in working order.  Install check valves in building sewer traps to prevent flood water from backing up into the drains of your home.  Assemble a disaster supplies kit containing: first aid kit, canned food and can opener, bottled water, rubber boots, rubber gloves, NOAA Weather Radio, battery-powered radio, flashlight, and extra batteries.  What YOUR community can do:  Assist hospitals and other operations which are critically affected by power failure by arranging for auxiliary power supplies.  River/rainfall readings are valuable to local emergency management agencies (EMA) and the National Weather Service (NWS) in assessing flood conditions and taking appropriate actions. Advanced warning provided by early detection is critical to saving lives. Automatic flood detection systems are available commercially for flood-prone communities. Contact your local NWS office or emergency management agency for further information on LOCAL FLOOD WARNING SYSTEMS. THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE HAS ISSUED A FLOOD WARNING FOR....  EMA RIVER / RAIN GAUGE  NWS   STAY INFORMED ABOUT THE STORM by listening to NOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio, and television for the latest flash flood/flood WATCHES, WARNINGS, and ADVISORIES. NOAA WEATHER RADIO IS THE BEST MEANS TO RECEIVE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. The National Weather Service continuously broadcasts updated weather warnings and forecasts that can be received by NOAA Weather Radios sold in many stores. The average range is 40 miles, depending on topography. Your National Weather Service recommends purchasing a radio that has both a battery backup and a tone-alert feature which automatically alerts you when a watch or warning is issued.  What to Listen For... FLASH FLOOD OR FLOOD WATCH: Flash flooding or flooding is possible within the designated WATCH area--be aler t. FLASH FLOOD OR FLOOD WARNING: Flash flooding or flooding has been repor ted or is imminent--take necessary precautions at once. URBAN AND SMALL STREAM ADVISORY: Flooding of small streams, streets, and low-lying areas, such as railroad under passes and urban stor m drains, is occurring. FLASH FLOOD OR FLOOD STATEMENT: Follow-up information regarding a flash flood/flood event.  The rule for being safe in a flooding situation is simple: HEAD FOR HIGHER GROUND AND STAY AWAY FROM FLOOD WATERS!   TAKE When a flash flood WATCH is issued -- Be aler t to signs of flash flooding and be ready to evacuate on a moment's notice. When a flash flood WARNING is issued for your area, or the moment you realize that a flash flood is imminent, act quickly to save yourself. You may have only SECONDS!  Go to higher ground -- Climb to safety!  Get out of areas subject to flooding. This includes dips, low spots, canyons, washes, etc.  Avoid already flooded and high velocity flow areas. Do not attempt to cross flowing streams.  If driving, be aware that the road bed may not be intact under flood waters. Turn around and go another way. NEVER drive through flooded roadways!  If the vehicle stalls, leave it immediately and seek higher ground. Rapidly rising water may engulf the vehicle and its occupants and sweep them away. Remember, it's better to be wet than dead!  Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood dangers.  Do not camp or park your vehicle along streams and washes, particularly during threatening conditions.   ACTION! When you receive a FLOOD WARNING:  If advised to evacuate, do so immediately.  Move to a safe area before access is cut off by flood water.  Continue monitoring NOAA Weather Radio, television, or emergency broadcast station for information.  During the flood:  Avoid areas subject to sudden flooding.  If you come upon a flowing stream where water is above your ankles, STOP! Turn around and go another way.  Do not attempt to drive over a flooded road. The depth of water is not always obvious. The road bed may be washed out under the water, and you could be stranded or trapped.  Children should NEVER play around high water, storm drains, viaducts, or arroyos.  After the flood:  If fresh food has come in contact with flood waters, throw it out.  Boil drinking water before using. Wells should be pumped out and the water tested for purity before drinking. If in doubt, call your local public health authority.  Seek necessary medical care at the nearest hospital. Food, clothing, shelter, and first aid are available from the Red Cross.  Do not visit disaster areas. Your presence might hamper rescue and other emergency operations.  Electrical equipment should be checked and dried before being returned to service.  Use flashlights, not lanterns, torches or matches, to examine buildings. Flammables may be inside.  Report broken utility lines to appropriate authorities.   FAMILY DISASTER PLAN Families should be prepared for all hazards that affect their area. NOAA's National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the American Red Cross urge each family to develop a family disaster plan. Where will your family be when disaster strikes? They could be anywhere--at work, at school, or in the car. How will you find each other? Will you know if your children are safe? Disasters may force you to evacuate your neighborhood or confine you to your home. What would you do if basic services--water, gas, electricity or telephones--were cut off?  Follow these basic steps to develop a family disaster plan... Gather information about hazards. Contact your local National Weather Service office, emergency management or civil defense office, and American Red Cross chapter. Find out what type of disasters could occur and how you should respond. Learn your community's warning signals and evacuation plans.  I.  I I.  Meet with your family to create a plan. Discuss the information you have gathered. Pick two places to meet: a spot outside your home for an emergency, such as fire, and a place away from your neighborhood in case you can't return home. Choose an out-of-state friend as your ""family check-in contact"" for everyone to call if the family gets separated. Discuss what you would do if advised to evacuate.  I I I.  Implement your plan. (1) Post emergency telephone numbers by phones; (2) Install safety features in your house, such as smoke detectors and fire extinguishers; (3) Inspect your home for potential hazards (such as items that can move, fall, break, or catch fire) and correct them; (4) Have your family learn basic safety measures, such as CPR and first aid; how to use a fire extinguisher; and how and when to turn off water, gas, and electricity in your home; (5) Teach children how and when to call 911 or your local Emergency Medical Services number; (6) Keep enough supplies in your home to meet your needs for at least three days. Assemble a disaster supplies kit with items you may need in case of an evacuation. Store these supplies in sturdy, easy-to-carry containers, such as backpacks or duffle bags. Keep important family documents in a waterproof container. Keep a smaller disaster supplies kit in the trunk of your car. A DISASTER SUPPLIES KIT SHOULD INCLUDE: A 3-day supply of water (one gallon per person per day) and food that won't spoil x one change of clothing and footwear per person x one blanket or sleeping bag per person x a first aid kit, including prescription medicines x emergency tools, including a battery-powered NOAA Weather Radio and a portable radio, flashlight, and plenty of extra batteries x an extra set of car keys and a credit card or cash x special items for infant, elderly, or disabled family members.

Washington State Department of Ecology received a grant from the Environmental            Protection Agency to create nonpoint source pollution educational materials            and was encouraged to distribute them among other environmental organizations            and government agencies. The result was a series of television commercials            and posters that aimed to increase public awareness about the pollution            we produce through everyday activities. The Tributary Strategies Program            received these materials and has worked with the local government contacts            in Maryland to air the 2-30 second commercials on their local cable            stations. Also, WBOC-TV 54 in Salisbury aired these commercials for            several weeks in the fall of 2001. Here you can see the resulting Non-Point            Source Pollution Education Campaign.

In recent years, sources of            water pollution like industrial wastes from factories have been greatly            reduced. Now, more than 60 percent of water pollution comes from things            like cars leaking oil, fertilizers from farms and gardens, and failing            septic tanks. All these sources add up to a big pollution problem. But            each of us can do small things to help clean up our water too. And that            adds up to a pollution solution!           Why do we need clean water?              Having clean water is of primary importance for our health and economy.            Clean water provides recreation, commercial opportunities, fish habitat,            drinking water and adds beauty to our landscape. All of us benefit from            clean water. And all of us have a role in getting and keeping our lakes,            rivers, marine and ground waters clean.                                                    What's                the problem with car washing?                  There's no problem with washing your car. It's just how and where                  you do it. The soap, together with the dirt and oil washed from                  your car, flows into nearby storm drains which run directly into                  lakes, rivers or marine waters. Soap detergents (including the                                                        biodegradable detergents)                  can have a poisonous effect on all types of aquatic life. Detergents                  can also cause severe damage to the gills, and destroy the external                  mucus layers that protect fish from bacteria and parasites. Additionally,                  too much soap in the water can make it difficult for aquatic organisms                  to get the oxygen from the water they need to survive.                 Clean Water tip:                                   How can you wash your car and help keep our waters clean?                                                        Use soap sparingly. Use a hose nozzle with a trigger to save                      water.                                         Pour your bucket of soapy water down the sink when you're                      done, not in the street. Or wash your car on a grassy or gravelly                      area so the ground can filter the water naturally.                                        Best of all, take your car to a commercial car wash, especially                      if you plan to clean the engine or the bottom of your car.                      Most car washes re-use wash water several times before sending                      it to the sewer system for treatment.                                                                                                 What's                    the problem with fertilizer?                   Fertilizer isn't a problem if it's used carefully. If you use                    too much fertilizer or apply it at the wrong time, it can easily                    wash off your lawn or garden into storm drains and then flow                    untreated into lakes or streams. Just like in your garden, fertilizer                    in lakes and                                                                 streams makes plants grow. In water                    bodies, extra fertilizer can mean extra algae and aquatic plantgrowth.                    Too much algae harms water quality and makes boating, fishing                    and swimming unpleasant. As algae decay, they use up oxygen                    in the water that fish and other wildlife need.                   Clean Water tip:                   How can you fertilize and help keep our waters clean?                                                              Use fertilizers sparingly. Many plants do not need as much                        fertilizer or need it as often as you might think.                                            Don't fertilize before a rain storm.                                            Consider using organic fertilizers; they release nutrients                        more slowly.                                            Use commercially available compost or make your own using                        garden waste. Mixing compost with your soil means your plants                        will need less chemical fertilizer and puts your waste to                        good use. Commercial compost and soil amendments may be                        available from your solid waste or wastewater utility as                        well as your local garden store.

Oil does not dissolve in water. It lasts a long time and sticks                    to everything from beach sand to bird feathers. Oil and other                    petroleum products are toxic to people, wildlife and plants.                    One pint of oil can make a slick larger than a football field.                    Oil that leaks from our cars onto roads and                                                 driveways is washed                    into storm drains, and then usually flows directly to alake                    or stream. Used motor oil is the largest single source of oil                    pollution in our lakes, streams and rivers. Americans spill                    180 million gallons of used oil each year into our waters. This                    is 16 times the amount spilled by the Exxon Valdez in Alaska.                   Clean Water tip:                     How can you use and change your motor oil and help keep our                    waters clean?                                                              Stop drips. Check for oil leaks regularly and fix them                        promptly. Keep your car tuned to reduce oil use.                                            Use ground cloths or drip pans beneath your vehicle if                        you have leaks or are doing engine work. Clean up spills                        immediately. Collect all used oil in containers with tight                        fitting lids. Do not mix different engine fluids.                                            Never dispose of oil or other engine fluids down the storm                        drain, on the ground or into a ditch.                                            Recycle used motor oil. Many auto supply stores and gas                        stations will accept used oil.                                            Buy recycled (re-refined) motor oil to use in your car.

It's a health risk to pets and people, especially children.                    It's a nuisance in our neighborhoods. Pet waste is full of bacteria                    that can make people sick. If it's washed into the storm drain                    and ends up in a lake, stream or marine water, the bacteria                    ends up in                                                                shellfish. People who eat                    those shellfish can get very sick. The waste produced by Seattle's                    dogs and cats is about what a citythe size of Renton or Kennewick                    -- about 50,000 people -- would produce. Unless people take                    care of it, the waste enters our water with no treatment.                   Clean Water tip:                   How can you get rid of pet waste and help keep our waters clean?                                     Here are some options.                                                               Scoop it up and flush it down the toilet. That's best because                        then your community sewage treatment plant or your septic                        system treats the pet waste.                                            Seal the waste in a plastic bag and throw it in the garbage.                        (This is legal in most areas, but check local laws.)                                             Bury small quantities in your yard where it can decompose                        slowly. Dig a hole one foot deep. Put three to four inches                        of waste at the bottom of the hole. Cover the waste with                        at least eight inches of soil. Bury the waste in several                        different locations in your yard and keep it away from vegetable                        gardens.                                                                              *all photos provided by Washington State Department          of Ecology                                  Search            Maryland DNR                                                                           Search   www.dnr.state.md.us                         Restoration and Protection             |  Bay Grasses  |  Harmful            Algae  |  Bay Monitoring               Bay Life Guide  |  Bay            Education                   Return to the  Maryland    DNR Home Page            Your opinion counts!

And boaters are paying attention. At last winters Baltimore Boat Show, a couple indicated to a Clean Marina staff member that they had narrowed their search for a new marina down to three facilities. They consulted a list of marinas participating in the Clean Marina Initiative and found that only one was active with the program. Well, said the woman, that makes the decision easy. Well keep our boat there. All marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs are urged to become certified Clean Marinas. The industry may avoid new regulations by taking advantage of this opportunity to select and implement pollution prevention measures on its own terms. Whats more, boating facilities have the most to gain by protecting the quality of Marylands waterways. It is good policy, good business, and good for the environment.

Lookout Marina; Jon Sheller, Rockhold Creek Marina; and Brandt Rodey, Shipwright Harbor with their awards.  The number of certified Clean Marinas surged to 23 this past quarter. The newest additions are Ferry Point Marina (Arnold), Lippincott Marine (Grasonville), Point Lookout Marina (Ridge), Rockhold Creek Marina (Deale), and Shipwright Harbor Marina (Deale). At Ferry Point Marina, owner Tom Wilhelm has made dramatic physical changes since he purchased the marina two and a half years ago. He removed a roadway along the seawall and is in the process of replacing it with vegetation. He replaced a crumbling bulkhead made of creosoted timbers with one made of non-toxic vinyl sheeting . And he created wetlands to filter stormwater runoff from the parking lot. Mr. Wilhelm has undertaken more modest efforts too. For example, he took advantage of DNRs grant program to install a sewage pumpout system and has recently begun recycling cans and bottles. As part of his efforts to protect Marylands waterways Richard Lippincott, president of Lippincott Marine, is installing a four-foot wide grassed buffer along his bulkhead. The buffer is graded such that stormwater is directed through a filter box before it is released into the Bay. He has also constructed a containment dike around his fuel and waste oil collection tanks. Mark Mattiucci and Joseph Salvo have been busy improving Point Lookout Marina since they purchased it in the spring of 1998. Among other things, they have established training procedures to enhance their staff s attention to environmental concerns. Over the next several years they will be replacing a 40-year old wooden bulkhead with vinyl sheeting and expand a vegetative buffer. At Rockhold Creek Marina, owner Jon Sheller insists that all vessel maintenance activities be conducted at least 100 feet from the water. He has also prepared thorough emergency response plans so that, in the event of a crisis, information about how to respond and who to call for assistance is readily available. John Meneely maintains natural shoreline, rather than bulkheading , around the perimeter of Shipwright Harbor Marina. In addition to being attractive, the vegetation provides wildlife habitat, filters stormwater runoff from the land, and acts as a buffer against incoming storms.  Happy holidays and best wishes for a prosperous and clean new year from the Clean Marina staff.  Pollution prevention equipment for marinas was on display during a multi-site open house on November 29. Seven marinas that received grant funding through the Maryland Clean Marina Initiative (CMI) displayed items such as:  A wash water recycling system that protects water quality by filtering and reusing pressure wash water,  A fish cleaning station that diverts nutrient-rich waste away from sensitive waterways, and an  Oil/water separator that draws contaminated water from bilges, captures hydrocarbons in a filter, and discharges clean water. The seven marinas are Turkey Point Marina and South River Marina (both in Edgewater); Triton Marina, The Cove, and Locust Point (all in Elkton); Pines Point Marina in Ocean Pines; and Ocean City Boatel/Travel Lift in Ocean City. The marinas are all in watersheds identified by the State as priority areas for restoration. Visitors during the open house included marina operators, U.S. Navy personnel, and school children.

GX253-08-1065521	"FACT  SHEET  Federal Emergency Management Agency  FLOODS AND FLASH FLOODS Mitigation pays. It includes any activities that prevent an emergency, reduce the chance of an emergency happening, or lessen the damaging effects of unavoidable emergencies. Investing in mitigation steps now such as constructing barriers such as levees and purchasing flood insurance will help reduce the amount of structural damage to your home and financial loss from building and crop damage should a flood or flash flood occur.  BEFORE  Find out if you live in a floodprone area from your local emergency management office or Red Cross chapter. Ask whether your property is above or below the flood stage water level and learn about the history of flooding for your region. Learn flood warning signs and your community alert signals. Request information on preparing for floods and flash floods.  This plan should include information on the safest routes to shelters. Individuals living in flash flood areas should have several alternate routes.  Make sure that all family members know how to -respond after a flood or flash flood. Teach all family members how and when to turn off gas, electricity, and water. Teach children how and when to call 9-1-1, police, fire department, and which radio station to tune to for emergency information.  Have disaster supplies on hand.  Flashlights and extra batteries  Portable, battery-operated radio and extra batteries  First aid kit and manual  Emergency food and water  Nonelectric can opener  Essential medicines  Cash and credit cards  Sturdy shoes  Learn about the National Flood Insurance Program. Ask your insurance agent about flood insurance. Homeowners policies do not cover flood damage.  If you live in a frequently flooded area, stockpile emergency building materials. These include plywood, plastic sheeting, lumber nails, hammer and saw, pry bar, shovels, and sandbags.  DURING  Develop an emergency communication plan. In case family members are separated from one another during floods or flash floods (a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and children are at school), have a plan for getting back together. Ask an out-of-state relative or friend to serve as the ""family contact."" After a disaster, it's often easier to call long distance. Make sure everyone in the family knows the name, address, and phone number of the contact person.  DURING A FLOOD WATCH s  Have check valves installed in building sewer traps to prevent flood waters from backing up in sewer drains. As a last resort, use large corks or stoppers to plug showers, tubs, or basins.  Listen to a battery-operated radio for the latest storm information. Fill bathtubs, sinks, and jugs with clean water in case water becomes contaminated. Bring outdoor belongings, such as patio furniture, indoors. Move valuable household possessions to the upper floors or to safe ground if time permits. If you are instructed to do so by local authorities, turn off all utilities at the main power switch and close the main gas valve. Be prepared to evacuate.  s  s  s  Plan and practice an evacuation route. Contact the local emergency management office or local American Red Cross chapter for a copy of the community flood evacuation plan.  s  s   AFTER  DURING  DURING A FLOOD  If Indoors: s Turn on battery-operated radio or television to get the latest emergency information. s Get your preassembed emergency supplies. s If told to leave, do so immediately.  Flood dangers do not end when the water begins to recede. Listen to a radio or television and don't return home until authorities indicate it is safe to do so. Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance -- infants, elderly people, and people with disabilities. Inspect foundations for cracks or other damage. Stay out of buildings if flood waters remain around the building. When entering buildings, use extreme caution. s  Throw away food -- including canned goods -- that has come in contact with flood waters. Pump out flooded basements gradually (about one-third of the water per day) to avoid structural damage. Service damaged septic tanks, cesspools, pits, and leaching systems as soon as possible. Damaged sewage systems are health hazards. Inspecting Utilities in a Damaged Home Check for gas leaks -- If you smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window and quickly leave the building. Turn off the gas at the outside main valve if you can and call the gas company from a neighbor's home. If you turn off the gas for any reason, it must be turned back on by a professional. Look for electrical system damage -- If you see sparks or broken or frayed wires, or if you smell hot insulation, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you have to step in water to get to the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician first for advice. Check for sewage and water lines damage -- If you suspect sewage lines are damaged, avoid using the toilets and call a plumber. If water pipes are damaged, contact the water company and avoid using water from the tap. You can obtain safe water by melting ice cubes.  If Outdoors: s Climb to high ground and stay there.  Avoid walking through any floodwaters. If it is moving swiftly, even water 6 inches deep can sweep you off your feet. s  If In a Car: If you come to a flooded area, turn around and go another way. s s If your car stalls, abandon it immediately and climb to higher ground. Many deaths have resulted from attempts to move stalled vehicles.  Wear sturdy shoes and use battery-powered lanterns or flashlights when examining buildings. Examine walls, floors, doors, and windows to make sure that the building is not in danger of collapsing. Watch out for animals, especially poisonous snakes, that may have come into your home with the flood waters. Use a stick to poke through debris. Watch for loose plaster and ceilings that could fall. Take pictures of the damage -- both to the house and its contents for insurance claims.  s  s  DURING AN EVACUATION s If advised to evacuate, do so immediately. s Evacuation is much simpler and safer before flood waters become too deep for ordinary vehicles to drive through. s Listen to a battery-operated radio for evacuation instructions. s Follow recommended evacuation routes -- shortcuts may be blocked.  s  s  Look for fire hazards.  Broken or leaking gas lines  Flooded electrical circuits  Submerged furnaces or electrical appliances  Flammable or explosive materials coming from upstream  Leave early enough to avoid being marooned by flooded roads. s  EMERGENCY PUBLIC INFORMATION  September 1993   BACKGROUNDER  FLOODS AND FLASH FLOODS EMERGENCY INFORMATION  WHAT IS A FLOOD?  Floods are the most common and widespread of all natural disasters-- except fire. Most communities in the United States can experience some kind of flooding after spring rains, heavy thunderstorms, or winter snow thaws. Floods can be slow, or fast rising but generally develop over a period of days. Dam failures are potentially the worst flood events. A dam failure is usually the result of neglect, poor design, or structural damage caused by a major event such as an earthquake. When a dam fails, a gigantic quantity of water is suddenly let loose downstream, destroying anything in its path.  1. Flood waters can be extremely dangerous. The force of six inches of swiftly moving water can knock people off their feet. The best protection during a flood is to leave the area and go to shelter on higher ground. 2. Flash flood waters move at very fast speeds and can roll boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings, and obliterate bridges. Walls of water can reach heights of 10 to 20 feet and generally are accompanied by a deadly cargo of debris. The best response to any signs of flash flooding is to move immediately and quickly to higher ground. 3. Cars can easily be swept away in just 2 feet of moving water. If flood waters rise around a car, it should be abandoned. Passengers should climb immediately to higher ground.  WHAT IS A FLASH FLOOD?  Flash floods usually result from intense storms dropping large amounts of rain within a brief period.  Floods and flash floods occur within all 50 states. Communities particularly at risk are those located in low-lying areas, near water, or downstream from a dam.  Flash floods occur with little or no warning and can reach full peak in only a few minutes.   HELP YOUR COMMUNITY GET READY The media can raise awareness about floods and flash floods by providing important information to the community. Here are some suggestions: 1. Publish a special section in your local newspaper with  HOW T HE PUB LIC C AN HE LP AFT E R A DISAS T E R  emergency information on floods and flash floods. Localize the information by printing the phone numbers of local emergency services offices, the American Red Cross, and hospitals. 2. Interview local officials about land use management and  W h en di s as ter s t ri kes , people everywhere want to help those in need. To ensure that this compassion and generosity are put to good use, the media can highlight these facts:  building codes in floodplains. Work with local emergency services and American Red Cross officials to prepare special reports for people with mobility impairments on what to do if an evacuation is ordered. 4. Periodically inform your community of local public warning 3.  systems.  Financial aid is an immediate need of disaster victims. Financial contributions should be made through a recognized voluntary organization to help ensure that contributions are put to their intended use. Before donating food or clothing, wait for instructions from local officials. Immediately after a disaster, relief workers usually don't have the time or facilities to set-up distribution channels, and too often these items go to waste. Volunteers should go through a recognized voluntary agency such as the American Red Cross or Salvation Army. They know what is needed and are prepared to deal with the need. Local emergency services officials also coordinate volunteer efforts for helping in disasters. Organizations and community groups wishing to donate items should first contact local officials, the American Red Cross, or Salvation Army to find out what is needed and where to send it. Be prepared to deliver the items to one place, tell officials when you'll be there, and provide for transportation, driver, and unloading.  DID s  YOU  K N O W. . . s  Individuals and business owners can protect themselves from flood losses by purchasing flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program. Homeowners' policies do not cover flood damage. Information is available through local insurance agents and emergency management offices. Flooding has caused the deaths of more than 10,000 people since 1900. Property damage from flooding now totals over $1 billion each year in the United States.  More than 2,200 lives were lost as a result of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania flood of 1889. This flood was caused by an upstream dam failure. Nearly 9 of every 10 presidential disaster declarations result from natural phenomena in which flooding was a major component. On July 31, 1976, the Big Thompson River near Denver overflowed after an extremely heavy storm. A wall of water 19 feet high roared down the Big Thompson Canyon where many people were camping. 140 people perished and millions of dollars worth of property were lost.  s  s  s  EMERG ENCY P UBLIC I NF ORMATI ON  September 1993"

Drake  struck oil in the world’s         first well.           This small hole drilled through the rock so peacefully         opened the way to wealth hitherto unknown. It yielded         about forty barrels per day, but the precious fuel was         now produced in commercial quantities. It opened also the         most important natural production of Pennsylvania, after         iron and coal.           This first well was in Cherry Tree Township, on the         Watson Flats, on the bank of  Oil         Creek  , about two miles below the thrifty borough         of  Titusville .           Venango County seems to have been the native home for         petroleum for although it has been found in large         quantities in neighboring counties, it was first gathered         there and its presence was known from the advent of man         in that vast region.           The Indians gathered oil from a stream called Oil         Creek, in this vicinity, which they used for medicinal         purposes. It became well known all over the country as         ""Seneca Oil,"" ""British Oil"" and other         names. It was collected by digging out the place where it         oozed out of the ground, and when oil and water had         accumulated, blankets were thrown in, taking up the oil,         when it was wrung out, and the process repeated.           A century since the product of Oil Creek Valley         amounted to a dozen barrels a year. The first shipment in         bulk was made by a man named Cary, who filled two         five-gallon kegs and lashed them on either side of the         horse he rode to the market in Pittsburgh. This supply         stocked the market.           By the year 1865 Venango County shipped 13,000 barrels         per day about the only oil produced in this country.           Petroleum was desired as an illuminator, but the small         quantity obtainable made it too expensive.           According to the production records more than one         billion barrels of oil were produced in 1923 for a         world’s record in oil production—and yet the         supply is far short of the world’s demand.           Fish oil is the earliest known illuminant and         lubricant. ""Coal oil,"" however, still used         erroneously as the name for kerosene, was discovered less         than eighty years ago by Dr. Abraham Gesner, who in 1846,         obtained oil from coal. That was enough to ruin the fish         oil industry, and soon more than fifty coal oil works         were put in operation, distilling oil from bituminous, or         soft coal.           A man named Kier, at Tarentum, Pennsylvania, in 1847,         bored for salt water and pumped up oil. He put it in         barrels and sold it. A professor at Dartmouth College,         using some of the oil, told George H. Bissell that in his         opinion it could be used for illuminating purposes.         Bissell investigated these claims and organized the         Petroleum Oil Company—which was the first of its         kind in the United States, and sent a quantity to         Benjamin Silliman, Professor of Chemistry in Yale College         who reported that nearly the whole of the raw product         could be treated so as to be used for illuminating and         other purposes without any waste.           In December, 1857, Colonel Edwin L. Drake, one of the         stock holders of this company, rode into Titusville on a         mail coach from Erie. He carried with him $1,000 with         which to begin boring for oil. He started immediately to         his work, but met with many discouragements.           Well drillers were unknown and well drilling machinery         almost unheard of in 1858. He built his ""pump         house"" and derrick, and with the assistance of         ""uncle Billy"" Smith, began drilling.           The beginning was made in quicksand and clay, and as         soon as the hole was made it filled up with water and         caved in. Drake then hit upon the scheme of driving an         iron pipe through to bedrock, and its success made the         use of this method the standard practice of today in the         oil fields everywhere.           After rock was reached they bored but three feet per         day, but by Saturday, August 27, 1859, the well had         reached the depth of sixty-nine feet and the drill was         working in coarse sand. Smith and his sons, who were         helping him, had finished for the week. As they were         quitting the drill dropped six inches, apparently into a         crevice, as was common in salt wells. No attention was         paid to this circumstance, the tools were drawn out and         all hands adjourned to Titusville.           Sunday morning Uncle Billy strolled out to the drill,         and to his astonishment found the well filled within a         few feet of the surface with a dark fluid. It was oil.         The news soon spread to the village, and when Colonel         Drake appeared he found Uncle Billy guarding three         barrels of petroleum. The pumping apparatus was adjusted,         and by noon the well was producing at the rate of twenty         barrels per day. The problem of the ages had been solved.         The world’s first oil well was in production.           Then began what has been called the ""oil         fever."" People from all parts of the country flocked         to western Pennsylvania. Oil companies were everywhere         organized, whose stock was sold on the market. Land which         for generations had been regarded as almost barren sold         for fabulous prices.           ""Coal Oil Johnnie,"" an ignorant young man         whose paternal acres had long brought only poverty and         were now found to be located with wealth, appeared in         Philadelphia, scattering ten dollar bills in all         directions, and buying teams of horses on one day, only         to give them to his coachmen on the next. He built an         opera house in Cincinnati and ended his career as its         doorkeeper.           In 1860, near Rouseville, the oil flowed out of a well         without the use of a pump, and other flowing wells in         adjacent localities were soon found.           Oil was first transported in wagons and boats. The         railroads were laid out to Oil City in 1865. In 1864         Samuel Van Syckel had constructed a pipe line four miles         in length, and the result was a change in the entire         method of transportation. A refinery was built at Corry         in 1862.           The Pennsylvania grade of crude oil is the best         lubricant that man has ever found. And since refineries         can add nothing to an oil that was not present in its         crude state, Pennsylvania grade of crude oil is still         supreme.           In recent years the Standard Oil Company has         controlled to a great extent the oil production of the         country.           The largest individual fortune the world has ever seen         is the outcome of the development of the business of         securing and distributing coal oil.

Forestry Programs                                                  Forest health is inextricably linked to healthy       streams and robust Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bays watersheds.    Forests function as filters removing sediments, nutrients and       other pollutants from water before they enter the groundwater system and       receiving streams.    The influx       of excessive nutrients– caused in part by deforestation, however, has       disrupted the Bays’ ecosystems. Forests also regulate the amount,       velocity, and rate of runoff maintaining a water body=s       natural hydrology.    Forested       riparian buffers along streams and rivers stabilize banks, reducing       erosion and sedimentation.    These       riparian buffers also enhance wildlife habitat by shading streams,       providing woody debris for habitat, and regulating stream temperature.          Protecting Maryland=s       forest resources greatly contributes to nonpoint source pollution          control.                                 Pursuant       to Section 6217, Maryland State agencies and local governments are working       to implement the ten forestry management measures for the control of       nonpoint source pollution.     The       forestry management measures are well integrated with agricultural, urban,       and wetlands/riparian programs.    This       vital linkage strengthens the individual measures implemented and also       makes the combined efforts more effective as a whole.          Integrating forestry efforts benefits funding of projects       associated with impaired waters, increases volunteerism, helps to educate       and involve the public, emphasizes the importance of a ‘watershed       focus’, and helps restore habitat values adjacent to cropland, along       streams and in urban settings.                                 5.2.1.) Stream ReLeaf                                                         In 2001, Marylanders created over 264 miles of forest       buffers along waterways under the leadership of DNR, a rate over twice the       annual goal.    Currently,       the total accomplishment is 595.7 miles.    This       accomplishment brings us very close to the Governor’s goal of 600 miles       by 2010, and is a bulwark of our efforts to reduce nutrient pollution and       restore habitat in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The incentives in the       Conservation Reserve Enhance Program helped almost double the rate of       forest buffer planting in the last year. CREP is a major factor in making       forest buffer establishment affordable for agricultural landowners. For       existing buffers, efforts are underway to track conservation occurring       through programs such as Forest Conservation Act, Critical Area Law, Rural       Legacy, and other local programs.                            Buffered       stream in Washington County         Based       upon the challenge of recruiting additional participants, an independent       contractor (funded by a NOAA grant) reviewed incentives for establishing       riparian forest buffers in Maryland. The study included a comprehensive       summary of existing incentives and rules and a survey of stakeholders.          The report recommended expansion of eligibility in several       programs, increased coordination efforts, increased funding for incentives       and technical assistance, and better funding for maintenance of newly       installed buffers.                        Partnerships, outreach, and coordination have continued to expand in       support of Stream ReLeaf goals.    See       the DNR Forest Service Stream Re-leaf website at  http://www.dnr.state.md.us/forests/programapps/ripfbi.html         5.2.2.)       Special Rivers                          The       Special Rivers Project consists of critical technical and outreach support       for watershed improvement through forest restoration and management.          Each of the four regional projects:  the Anacostia River ,  Monocacy River ,  Susquehanna       River , and  Town Creek --       remain focused on  buffer creation and preparation of site-specific       forest stewardship plans.    Landowner       interest increased substantially during the 2000 – 2001 time period for       which data is available.    The       latest reporting period for Special Rivers indicates that 49 miles and 663       acres of riparian forest buffers were established which totals over 2.5       times the target goal.    Stewardship       Plans were developed for 182 participants covering 5297 acres          -- triple the target goal.    Additional       activities included ongoing monitoring, reinforcement plantings to assure       stand development, and potential sites were targeted for inspection in 10       subwatersheds and on DNR lands.    See       the Special Rivers website at  http://www.dnr.state.md.us/forests/programapps/srpcon.html        for more detail.                                 5.2.3.)       Forest Conservation Act                         The       Forest Conservation Act (FCA) applies to all activities requiring a permit       for subdivision, grading, or sediment control that is larger than 40,000       square feet, or slightly less than one acre. Information on the condition       of the existing forest and a plan for conserving the most valuable       portions of the forest are required. Plans are prepared on a site by site       basis by qualified resource professionals and are reviewed for adherence       to the Act at the county level.    For       more detail, see the FCA website at  http://www.dnr.state.md.us/forests/healthreport/act.html         Return To Table Of Contents>>                   5.3.)       Urban - Developed land and New Development Programs                                 This category       of management measures is intended to control runoff and treat associated       pollutants generated from new development, redevelopment, and new and       relocated roads, highways and bridges.          In Maryland, this measure is met through the State’s Stormwater       Management (SWM) program, which addresses proposed disturbances over 5,000       square feet, including residential, commercial, industrial, and       institutional development, as well as new and relocated roads and bridges.    The Phase II SWM regulatory program incorporates low impact       development methodologies to reduce the negative impacts of site runoff.          Protection is also provided by erosion and sediment controls, smart       growth initiatives, and open space preservation programs.          In addition, the Critical Area Program (requiring forest buffers       along the Chesapeake Bay) is essential to these efforts as an important       watershed protection tool.    The       Critical Areas Program applies to tidal lands and waters of the Chesapeake       Bay to the head of tide and all lands within 1000 feet of Mean High Water       or from the landward edge of tidal wetlands.                                                 On a       watershed scale, the implementation of these urban programs continues to       promote environmentally sensitive site design, increase economic       feasibility of low impact development, and contribute to the integrated       approach of watershed protection.    This       approach is strengthened through the incorporation of non-agricultural       nutrient management efforts, forestry, and wetland/riparian management       measures.                                                    5.3.1.)       Stormwater Management -- Phase II Program                           Final 1999 Stormwater Phase II regulations expand the       existing NPDES Stormwater Management (SWM) program to address stormwater       discharges from municipal storm sewers and construction activity.           The new SWM program incorporates the Phase II requirements,       detailed in the publication known as the 2000 Maryland Stormwater Design       Manual.    It has become part of       the State’s development regulations by reference and SWM is required on       all sites which disturb over 5,000 square feet of land.           The new Manual (adopted October 2, 2000) concentrates on       controlling runoff increases and mitigating water quality degradation       associated with new development as well as redevelopment of more urbanized       areas.    The Manual includes a       unified approach for sizing stormwater BMPs to meet pollutant removal       goals, maintain groundwater recharge, reduce stream channel erosion,       prevent overbank flooding, and pass extreme floods.          For more detail,  see the MDE website at    www.mde.state.md.us/environment/wma/stormwatermanual.                           5.3.2.)       Low Impact Development (LID )                                Bioretention, raingardens, reductions in impervious       surface area, disconnections of roof runoff, and directing sheet flow to       vegetated buffers are some of the main components of the voluntary Low       Impact Development (LID) approach for managing stormwater runoff.          Prince George’s County was one of the first areas to develop and       use bioretention techniques as an integrated management practice (IMP).           The County continues to refine the bioretention IMP design and its       effectiveness has been documented by studies that show significant       pollutant loading reductions. The standards address the minimization of       impervious area and thus runoff, treatment/ pre-treatment, structural and       non-structural BMPs, peak discharges, stream channel protection,       redevelopment, industrial Pollution Prevention Plans, sites with high       pollution potential (hotspots), and permitting.          In addition, an innovative system of          “credits” is offered to those employing progressive planning       techniques.    The six       credit-producing efforts reduce the impacts of development as well as       reduce the size and cost of SWM practices needed onsite.                                           Rain Garden in DNR parking Lot: an             Urban demonstration Project .                                         5.3.3.)          Sediment and Erosion Control Program                                                             The         Maryland Sediment and Erosion Control Program is operated at the local         level where local governments have shown the ability to enforce the         provisions of their ordinances relating to soil erosion and sediment         control.     In other         cases, the state has retained enforcement responsibilities.            MDE conducts periodic reviews of local programs to ensure that         implementation is acceptable and it has the authority to suspend         delegation and take over any program that does not meet state standards.                               5.3.4.)         Onsite Sewage Disposal Systems (OSDS)                                            Maryland has approximately 400,000 septic systems         today (approximately 1 in 5 households), with potential for         significantly more.    With         few exceptions, residents are still using the same septic system         technology today that was used 50 years ago.            These systems are not designed to remove nutrient pollution,         which is the key type of pollution targeted by the Chesapeake Bay         clean-up effort.                                         The         Maryland Department of the Environment, Ground Water Permits Division is         responsible for the development of regulations pertaining to the citing,         construction, and general permitting of septic systems or OSDS.            Authority for permitting, tracking and monitoring OSDS is         delegated to county health departments.            For the 2002 legislative session, a bill has been introduced for         tax incentives to owners who upgrade their systems to be more efficient         and for increased nutrient removal.                                     In         2001, the Coastal Nonpoint Program distributed a Request for Proposals         (RFP) to local jurisdictions in the Coastal Zone of Maryland to fund         projects that address the siting, design, operation, and maintenance of         onsite sewage disposal systems (OSDS).             The major objectives of the RFP solicitation were to help ensure         conventional onsite or decentralized systems are sited and installed         properly in accordance with appropriate state and local regulations and         codes; are periodically inspected and repaired as necessary; and that         the appropriate regulatory agency is aware of the location of systems to         provide oversight and education, for example, periodically providing         owners with operation and maintenance information.                                         As         a result of the RFP, Maryland has approved funding for seven counties         interested in improving OSDS management through improved record-keeping,         outreach and repair and maintenance of septic systems.            Maryland is using federal Coastal Nonpoint Source Program         (Section 6217) funds to help coastal counties develop accurate and         complete inventories, databases, and maps of properties served by septic         systems since outdated, incomplete or missing records and information         currently hampers existing local management efforts.            These funds will enable local governments to reduce the impacts         of septic systems and protect environmentally sensitive areas by (1)         identifying areas in need of increased monitoring due to potential water         quality impacts, (2) identifying areas that should be placed into sewer         service systems, and (3) targeting homeowners for outreach on system         maintenance.                                                   5.3.5.)         Smart Growth Initiatives                               As         the State moves forward with various programs to reduce urban nonpoint         source pollution (stormwater, on-site development, sediment and erosion         control), it also moves forward with its Smart Growth Initiative.    The Smart Growth Initiative addresses nonpoint source         pollution by protecting rural landscapes, agricultural lands, forests,         and other natural areas, encouraging development in areas with existing         infrastructure, and by promoting the principals of            Maryland’s    ‘GreenPrint’         and ‘Green Building’ programs.             DNR has numerous programs and initiatives that contribute to         achieving the goals of Smart Growth, some of which are described below.         More information on Smart Growth is available at  http://www.op.state.md.us/smartgrowth/index.html .                                                              5.3.5.1.)           Program Open Space                                                 The           Department of Natural Resources' Program Open Space (POS) is a           nationally recognized program that provides funding for Maryland's           state and local parks and conservation areas. Established in 1969,           Program Open Space symbolizes Maryland's long-term commitment to           conserving natural resources while providing exceptional outdoor           recreation opportunities.    The           program has resulted in the acquisition of more than 234,000 acres of           open space for state parks and natural resource areas and 31,000 acres           of local park land.    More           than 3,900 county and municipal parks and conservation areas have been           built through POS. http://www.dnr.state.md.us/pos.html             5.3.5.2.)           Rural Legacy Program                                     The           Rural Legacy Program provides the focus and funding necessary to           protect large, contiguous tracts of land and other strategic areas           from sprawl development and to enhance natural resource, agricultural,           forestry and environmental protection through cooperative efforts           among state and local governments and land trusts. Protection is           provided through the acquisition of easements and fee estates from           willing landowners and the supporting activities of Rural Legacy           Sponsors and local governments.    During           2001, the Rural Legacy Program announced grants of $29.6 million to           permanently protect 11,000 acres across the State.    The State has previously awarded $82 million to counties and           Baltimore City to protect rural lands.               See  http://www.dnr.state.md.us/rurallegacy/index.html            for more information.                                                 5.3.5.2.)           GreenPrint Program                                                             In May 2001, Governor Glendening signed into law a new $35 million           program designed to protect lands critical to long-term ecological           health. These lands, referred to as Maryland's green infrastructure,           provide the natural foundation needed to support a diverse plant and           animal population, and enables valuable natural processes like           filtering water and cleaning the air, to take place.                                                    The GreenPrint Program authorizes two state           agencies to undertake activities to conserve targeted lands: the           Department of Natural Resources and the Maryland Agricultural Land           Preservation Foundation (MALPF).              DNR has the authority to spend 75% of the funds allocated on           green infrastructure land acquisitions and easements.              MALPF has authority to spend 25% of the GreenPrint Program           funds for protection of properties within MALPF-approved agricultural           districts that contain green infrastructure lands.               Local government approval is required for all projects using           DNR’s portion of GreenPrint funds. During September through November           2001, the State’s Board of Public Works approved over $11 million in           GreenPrint funds to protect almost 3,000 acres of vital Maryland           forests and wetlands.    See           the website at  http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/greenprint/                     Return To Table Of Contents>>                       5.4.)         Marinas and Recreational Boating – Clean Marinas                                                             The Clean Marinas Initiative was developed in         response to Section 6217 of the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization         Amendments of 1990, which requires that states address nonpoint source         pollution from marinas and recreational boating.            Maryland established the Clean Marina Initiative to promote         understanding and adoption of pollution prevention measures associated         with the impacts of pleasure boats on water quality.            Densely populated marinas and the associated operation and         maintenance of boats can have seasonal or sporadic water quality         impacts.              The Clean Marinas Program is able to demonstrate to         the marina audience actual examples of effective pollution prevention         and reduction practices.    A         voluntary Clean Marina certification process has proven beneficial as a         marketing tool to businesses (marinas, boat maintenance) interested in         promoting environmentally sensitive boat and marina operation.     In         addition, other nonpoint source management measures have been shown to         fit well into the Clean Marinas Program.            These include vegetated or forested buffers, reducing impervious         area, sewage pumpout facilities, wetland creation, and onsite fuel,         pesticide, and chemical control.                                           The         program goal is to certify 25 percent of the State's 600 boating         facilities as Clean Marinas by 2004. As of December 2001, 127 facilities         have pledged (Step 1) to protect MD's waterways from harmful chemicals,         excess nutrients, and debris. Of these, 44 have implemented pollution         prevention measures and been certified (Step 2) as Clean Marinas or         Clean Marina Partners. The Clean Marina Partner designation is for         facilities, such as public boat ramps, which are not true marinas but         that promote Clean Marina ideals.     The DNR Clean Marinas Program staff increased         participation in the Clean Marina Initiative, and conducted meetings of         the Clean Marina Committee, plus workshops, and a program evaluation to         identify and address implementation roadblocks.            Program staff continuously refine the Initiative by keeping         abreast of advances in technology and new BMPs through industry and         academic publications and attending relevant meetings, workshops and         conferences. The Clean Marina Guidebook will be revised as technologies         and laws change.                                         During         2001, the Clean Marina Initiative was implemented through a combination         of outreach to marinas, confirmation visits, marketing to boaters, and         promotion of certified Clean Marinas.            Staff continued to encourage marinas to adopt pollution         prevention measures and become certified Clean Marinas by conducting         outreach efforts such as personal phone calls and visits, workshops,         quarterly newsletter, etc.    Certified         Clean Marinas were highlighted by award presentations, features in         newsletters and exhibits, and through hosting the annual awards         ceremony. Press releases announced new pledges, new certifications,         workshops, clean boating tip cards, free petroleum control kits ( i.e.,          oil absorbent pad, instructions for use & disposal, and petroleum         control brochure), and other outreach materials.            Many of these activities were accomplished through a display of         the Clean Marina exhibit at the 2001 U.S. Sail and Power Boat Shows and         other appropriate shows and festivals.    See the Clean Marina website at            http://www.dnr.state.md.us/boating/cleanmarina/ .                               The         Nonpoint Source Program has funded the installation of best management         practices (BMPs) at Maryland marinas located in Priority Category 1         watersheds.    The map below         indicates the marinas that have used nonpoint source cost-share funds to         install a variety of practices (e.g. the installation of fish cleaning         stations, oil and antifreeze recycling stations, recycling pressure         washing systems, vacuum sanders, high-volume low pressure (HVLP) spray         guns and BayScape buffers).     BMP implementation assists the Clean Marinas Program in         its overall outreach toward marina owners as it demonstrates cost         effective methods of pollution reduction and prevention practices.                               During the summer of         2001, EPA Region III representatives toured several nonpoint source         program projects in Maryland.    As         part of their tour, EPA and DNR representatives visited the Tidewater         Marina, a Clean Marina in Havre De Grace, Maryland.             State and EPA staff were able to see first-hand a clean marina         and on-the-ground implementation of best management practices.                                                                      Tidewater Marina Operator Jeff Williams speaking about best             management Practices                                                                          Wash water capture facility at the Tidewater Marina                                                                                                                                                                                                  Return To Table Of Contents>>           Last Updated:         06/15/02
GX261-71-6219095	NICE  3  Project Fact Sheet  D YEBATH R EUSE M ANUFACTURING A B ENEFITS  IN  C  ARPET   Reduction in energy use, industry wide, of 3.6 trillion Btu/year; 7 trillion Btu by the year 2010  70% reduction of auxiliary chemicals required, 36 million pounds, nationwide  42% reduction of water required, 400 billion gallons nationwide  Savings of $1.6 million per year for each average-sized carpet manufacturing plant  NEW SYSTEM ENABLES TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS TO REUSE DYEBATH CHEMICALS AND PROCESSING WATER REDUCING ENERGY, WATER, AND OPERATING EXPENSES The Georgia Institute of Technology (G.I.T.) has developed an effective automated dyebath analysis and reuse system that improves the energy, environmental, and economic performance of dyehouse batch operations. The new system enables dyeing solutions to be accurately monitored and adjusted for reuse. According to industry estimates, 160 pounds of water are used to produce each pound of textile product. The current wasteful batch dyeing process requires all water and residual chemicals, as well as the energy required to heat the mixture for dyeing, to be dumped after one application. Spent dyebaths can only be reused after they are sampled, analyzed, and reconstituted, a process requiring labor and expertise that are unavailable in the dyehouses. Therefore, successful commercial reuse depends on an automated analysis system that precisely analyzes dyebath samples in real-time and provides for reconstitution and reuse. If fully implemented throughout the carpet industry, this innovation is expected to reduce energy consumption by 3.6 trillion Btu/year. Waste and cost savings will also be substantial. A D S  A  PPLICA TIONS  Though this project was developed for nylon carpet dyeing, the technology holds promise for widespread implementation in carpet manufacturing. In addition, it offers several opportunities involving other textile products, fiber types, dye classes, and dyeing equipment.  UTOMA TED  YEBA TH  YSTEM  This  automated dyebath system includes (from left to right): a carpet dyeing chamber, a holding tank, and a dye analyzer that adjusts dyeing solutions for reuse. This system dramatically reduces energy use, discharged wastes, and overall costs.  OFFICE OF INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY   Project Description Goal: The project goal is to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate a commercial scale, automated dyebath reuse system for nylon carpets. This will establish the ability to improve the energy, economic, and environmental performance of batch dyeing through automated dyebath reuse. NICE3--National Industrial Competitiveness through Energy, Environment, and Economics: An innovative, cost-sharing program to promote energy efficiency, clean production, and economic competitiveness in industry. This grant program provides funding to state and industry partners for the first commercial demonstration of energy efficient and clean production manufacturing and industrial technologies. Total project cost for a single award must be cost-shared at a minimum of 50% by a combination of state and industrial partner dollars. The DOE share for each award shall not exceed $500,000 to the industrial partner and up to $25,000 to the sponsoring state agency for a maximum of $525,000.  A series of tests examined necessary changes in the batch dyeing process. Effective reuse of the baths requires that the conventional dilution cooldown at the end of the cycle be eliminated and that the subsequent cycle be started hot. Both hot-termination and hotstartup present risks of product quality defects, and appropriate adjustments were devised. Development of the sampling and analysis system included investigation of low cost alternatives in dual-beam spectrophotometry and the means to integrate computer control of the analysis system components with both the programmable logic controller (PLC) controlling the manufacturing equipment and the mini-computer for production scheduling. The resulting system permits sampling and accurate analysis of the spent dyebaths without human intervention -- no requirement for additional labor or the expertise of an on-site chemist. The same computer calculates necessary makeup chemicals and dyes to reconstitute the spent bath for reuse with the next batch. The innovation is applicable to a variety of batch dyeing systems.  P Georgia Institute of Technology is demonstrating this new technology with assistance from the Georgia Pollution Prevention Assistance Division, Shaw Industries, and the NICE3 Program through the Department of Energy's Office of Industrial Technologies.  ROJECT  P  AR TNERS  Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta, GA Georgia Pollution Prevention Assistance Division Atlanta, GA NICE3 Program U.S. Department of Energy Washington, DC Shaw Industries Dalton, GA  Progress and Milestones  Techniques were developed to permit hot-start and hot-termination of the batch dye cycles, with two different dye chemistry systems.  Developed an automated, low-cost, dual-beam spectrophotometry system with calibration for a three-component acid dye recipe.  Plant equipment was installed and modified to recover spent dyebaths for reuse.  Software was created to control the analysis system and to interface with the PLC and mini-computer, which provides equipment and schedule control respectively.  The performance of the automated analysis system and the dyebath reuse process has been demonstrated for several series of nylon 6 and nylon 6.6 broadloom carpets.
