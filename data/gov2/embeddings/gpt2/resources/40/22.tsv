ABOUT THIS FAQ      Last modified 26 May 2008        This list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) has been compiled from questions asked of the SPC as well as basic tornado research information and countless scientific resources.  More material will be added, time permitting.  If you find a link not working or an error of any sort, please  e-mail the FAQ author .     The  Tornado FAQ is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to tornadoes. Instead, it is a quick-reference summary of tornado knowledge, which will link you to more detailed information if you desire. Recent books from your local library or a major university library are still the deepest resource for learning about tornadoes and other  severe storms; so if you are doing your own research or school reports, please visit the library in person. There are many good websites with tornado information also. Some of them are linked from the answers below. None of the links to outside websites implies any kind of commercial endorsement on the part of the SPC. The intent here is to direct you to the best tornado info available. There is also a partial  list of technical scientific references  related to tornadoes for  those with some meteorological education and training.

Complete Tornado FAQ content is found at the  mirror-backup site .        THE BASICS ABOUT TORNADOES      What is a tornado?     According  to the  Glossary of Meteorology  (AMS 2000), a tornado is  ""a violently rotating column of air, pendant  from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud.""   Literally, in order for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with the ground  and  the cloud base.  Weather scientists haven't found it so simple in practice, however, to classify and define tornadoes.  For example, the difference is unclear between an strong mesocyclone (parent thunderstorm circulation) on the ground, and a large, weak tornado.  There is also disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. It is well-known that a tornado may  not have a visible funnel . Also, at what wind speed of the cloud-to-ground vortex does a tornado begin?   How close must two or more different tornadic circulations become to qualify as a one  multiple-vortex tornado , instead of separate tornadoes?  There are no firm answers.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How  do tornadoes form?    The classic answer -- ""warm moist Gulf air meets cold Canadian air and dry air from the Rockies"" -- is a gross oversimplification.  Many thunderstorms  form under those conditions (near warm fronts, cold fronts and drylines respectively), which never even come close  to producing tornadoes.   Even  when the large-scale environment is extremely favorable for tornadic thunderstorms, as in an SPC ""High Risk"" outlook, not every thunderstorm spawns a tornado.  The truth is that we don't fully understand.   The   most  destructive and deadly tornadoes occur from  supercells  -- which are rotating thunderstorms with a well-defined radar circulation called a    mesocyclone .   [Supercells   can  also produce  damaging hail , severe non-tornadic winds, unusually frequent  lightning , and  flash floods .] Tornado formation is believed to be dictated mainly by things which happen  on the storm scale , in and around the mesocyclone.   Recent theories and results from the  VORTEX  program suggest that once a mesocyclone is underway, tornado  development is related to the temperature differences across the edge of downdraft air wrapping around the mesocyclone (the   occlusion downdraft ).  Mathematical modeling studies of tornado formation also indicate that it can happen without such temperature patterns; and in fact, very little temperature variation was observed near some of the most destructive tornadoes in history on  3 May 1999 .  The details behind these theories are given in several of the  Scientific References  accompanying this FAQ.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       What direction  do tornadoes come from?  Does the region of the US play a role in path direction?       Tornadoes can appear from any direction.  Most move from southwest to northeast, or west to east.  Some tornadoes have changed direction amid path, or even backtracked.  [A tornado can double back suddenly, for example, when its bottom is hit by outflow winds from a thunderstorm's core.]  Some areas of the US  tend  to have more paths from a specific direction, such as northwest in Minnesota or southeast in coastal south Texas.  This is because of an increased frequency of certain tornado-producing weather patterns (say, hurricanes in south Texas, or northwest-flow weather systems in the upper Midwest).    BACK UP TO THE TOP      Does  hail always come before the tornado?  Rain?   Lightning ?  Utter silence?    Not necessarily, for any of those.  Rain, wind,  lightning ,  and  hail  characteristics vary from storm to storm, from one hour to the next, and even with the direction the storm is moving with respect to the observer.  While large hail  can  indicate the presence of an unusually dangerous thunderstorm, and  can  happen before a tornado, don't depend on it.  Hail, or any particular pattern of rain, lightning or calmness, is not a reliable predictor of tornado threat.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      How  do tornadoes dissipate?    The details are still debated by tornado scientists.  We do know tornadoes need a source of instability (heat, moisture, etc.) and a larger-scale property of rotation ( vorticity ) to keep going.  There are a lot of processes around a thunderstorm which can possibly rob the area around a tornado of either instability or vorticity.  One is relatively cold  outflow  -- the flow of wind out of the precipitation area of a shower or thunderstorm.  Many tornadoes have been observed to go away soon after being hit by outflow.  For decades, storm observers have documented the death of numerous tornadoes when their parent circulations ( mesocyclones ) weaken after they become wrapped in outflow air -- either from the same thunderstorm or a different one.  The irony is that some kinds of thunderstorm outflow may help to  cause  tornadoes, while other forms of outflow may  kill  tornadoes.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      Do tornadoes really skip?     Not in a literal sense, despite what you may have read in many older references, news stories, or even damage survey reports.  By definition (above), a tornado must be in  contact with the ground.  There is disagreement in meteorology over whether or not multiple touchdowns of the same vortex or  funnel cloud  mean different tornadoes (a strict interpretation).  In either event, stories of skipping tornadoes usually mean    There was continuous contact between vortex and ground in the path, but it was too weak to do damage;   Multiple tornadoes happened; but there was no survey done to precisely separate their paths (very common before the 1970s); or  There were multiple tornadoes with only short separation, but the survey erroneously classified them as one tornado.    BACK UP TO THE TOP      How long does a tornado last?    Tornadoes can last from several seconds to more than an hour.  The longest-lived tornado in history is really unknown, because so many of the long-lived tornadoes reported from the early-mid 1900s and before are believed to be tornado series instead.  Most tornadoes last less than 10 minutes.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      How close to a tornado does the barometer drop?  And how far does it drop ?     It varies. A barometer can start dropping many hours or even days in advance of a tornado if there is low pressure on a broad scale moving into the area. Strong pressure falls will often happen as the mesocyclone (parent circulation in the thunderstorm) moves overhead or nearby. The biggest drop will be in the tornado itself, of course. It is very hard to measure pressure in tornadoes since most weather instruments can't survive. A few low-lying, armored probes called "" turtles "" have been placed successfully in tornadoes. This includes one deployment on 15 May 2003 by engineer/storm chaser Tim Samaras, who recorded pressure fall of over 40 millibars through an unusually large tornado. On 24 June 2003, another of Tim's probes recorded a  100 millibar  pressure plunge in a violent tornado near Manchester, SD ( National Geographic report ). Despite those spectacular results, and a few fortuitous passes over barometers through history, we still do not have a database of tornado pressures big enough to say much about average tornado pressures or other barometric characteristics.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is a waterspout?    A waterspout is a  tornado over water  -- usually meaning non-supercell tornadoes over water.  Waterspouts are common along the southeast U.S. coast -- especially off southern Florida and the Keys -- and can happen over seas, bays and lakes worldwide.  Although waterspouts are always tornadoes by definition; they don't officially count in tornado records unless they hit land.  They are smaller and weaker than the most intense Great Plains tornadoes, but still can be quite dangerous.  Waterspouts can overturn small boats, damage ships, do significant damage when hitting land, and kill people.  The  National Weather Service  will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters, or tornado warnings when waterspouts can move onshore.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      How are tornadoes in the northern hemisphere different from tornadoes in the southern hemisphere?    The sense of rotation is usually the opposite. Most tornadoes -- but not all! -- rotate  cyclonically , which is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise south of the equator.  Anticyclonic tornadoes  (clockwise-spinning in the northern hemisphere) have been observed, however -- usually in the form of waterspouts, non-supercell land tornadoes, or anticyclonic whirls around the rim of a supercell's mesocyclone. There have been several documented cases of cyclonic and anticyclonic tornadoes under the same thunderstorm at the same time. Anticyclonically rotating supercells with tornadoes are extremely rare; but  one struck near Sunnyvale, CA , in 1998. Remember, ""cyclonic"" tornadoes spin counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What  is a multivortex  tornado ?   Multivortex (a.k.a. multiple-vortex) tornadoes contain two or more small, intense  subvortices  orbiting the center of the larger tornado circulation.  When a tornado doesn't contain too much dust and debris,  they can sometimes be spectacularly  visible .  These vortices may form and die within a few seconds, sometimes appearing to train through the same part of the tornado one after another.  They can happen in all sorts of tornado sizes, from huge "" wedge "" tornadoes to narrow "" rope "" tornadoes. Subvortices are the cause of most of the narrow, short, extreme swaths of damage that sometimes arc through tornado tracks.  From the air, they can preferentially mow down crops and stack the stubble, leaving  cycloidal marks in fields .  Multivortex tornadoes are the source of most of the old stories from newspapers and other media before the late  20th century which told of several tornadoes seen together at once.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is the original F-scale?    Dr. T. Theodore Fujita developed a damage scale (Fujita 1971, Fujita and Pearson 1973) for winds, including tornadoes, which was supposed to relate the degree of damage to the intensity of the wind.   This scale was the result.  The original F-scale should not be used anymore, because it has been replaced by  an enhanced version .  Tornado wind speeds are still largely unknown; and  the wind speeds on the original F-scale have never been scientifically tested and proven . Different winds may be needed to cause the same damage depending on how well-built a structure is, wind direction, wind duration,  battering by flying debris, and a bunch of other factors.  Also, the process of rating the damage itself is largely a judgment call -- quite inconsistent and arbitrary (Doswell and Burgess, 1988).  Even  meteorologists and engineers highly experienced in damage survey techniques often came up with different F-scale ratings for the same damage.  Even with all its flaws, the original F-scale was the only widely used tornado rating method for over three decades.  The  enhanced F-scale  takes effect 1 February 2007.   BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is the Enhanced F-scale?     The Enhanced F-scale  ( simple table  or detailed  95 page PDF ) is a much more precise and robust way to assess tornado damage than the  original .  It classifies F0-F5 damage as calibrated by engineers and meteorologists across 28 different types of damage indicators (mainly various kinds of buildings, but also a few other structures as well as trees).  The idea is that a ""one size fits all"" approach just doesn't work in rating tornado damage, and that a tornado scale needs to take into account the typical strengths and weaknesses of different types of construction.  This is because the same wind does different things to different kinds of structures.  In the Enhanced F-scale, there will be different, customized standards for assigning any given F rating to a well built, well anchored wood-frame house compared to a garage, school, skyscraper, unanchored house, barn, factory, utility pole or other type of structure.  In a real-life tornado track, these ratings can be mapped together more smoothly to make a damage analysis.  Of course, there still will be gaps and weaknesses on a track where there was little or nothing to damage, but such problems will be less common than under the  original F-scale .  As with the original F-scale, the enhanced version will rate the tornado as a whole based on most intense damage within the path.    There are no plans to systematically re-evaluate historical tornadoes using the Enhanced F-scale.   A full PDF document on the Enhanced F-scale is online .  BACK UP TO THE TOP        So if the original F-scale winds are just guesses, why are they so specific?    Excellent question.  Those winds were arbitrarily attached to the damage scale based on 12-step mathematical interpolation between the hurricane criteria of the  Beaufort wind scale , and the threshold for Mach 1 (738 mph).  Though the F-scale actually peaks at F12 (Mach 1), only F1 through F5 are used in practice, with F0 attached for tornadoes of winds weaker than hurricane force.  Again, F-scale wind-to-damage relationships are untested, unknown and purely hypothetical.  They have never been proven and may not represent real tornadoes.  F-scale winds should not be taken literally.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      I heard the Oklahoma City tornado was almost ""F6.""  Is that a real  level on the original F-scale?    Only in untested theory.  Fujita plotted hypothetical winds higher than F5; but as mentioned in the previous answer above, they were only guesses.  Even if the winds measured by portable Doppler radar (32 meters above ground level, roughly 302 mph)  had been over 318 mph, the tornado would still be rated ""only"" F5 since F5 is the  most intense possible damage level .  On the  Enhanced F-scale , there is no such thing as ""F6.""    BACK UP TO THE TOP        What is a ""significant"" tornado?    A tornado is classified as ""significant"" if it does F2 or greater damage on the  Enhanced F scale . Grazulis (1993) also included killer tornadoes of any damage scale in his significant tornado database.   It is important to know that those definitions are arbitrary, for scientific research.  No tornado is  necessarily  in significant.  Any tornado can kill or cause damage; and some tornadoes rated less than F2  probably could do F2 or greater damage if they hit a well-built house during peak intensity.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       Big  fat tornadoes are the strongest ones, right?     Not necessarily. There is a statistical trend (as  documented  by NSSL's Harold Brooks) toward wide tornadoes having higher  F-scale  damage.  This can be out of more strength or out of greater opportunity for targets to damage -- or some blend of both.  However, the size or shape of  any particular tornado  does not say anything conclusive about its strength.  Some small "" rope ""  tornadoes can still do violent damage of  F4 or F5 ; and some very large tornadoes over a quarter-mile wide have  produced only weak damage of  F0 to F1 .    BACK UP TO THE TOP      Can't  we weaken or destroy tornadoes somehow, like by bombing them or sucking out their heat with a bunch of dry ice?    The main problem with anything which could  realistically stand a chance at affecting a tornado (e.g., hydrogen bomb) is that it would be even more deadly and  destructive than the tornado itself.  Lesser things (like huge piles of dry ice or smaller conventional weaponry)  would be too hard to deploy in the right place fast enough, and would likely not have enough impact to affect the  tornado much anyway.  Imagine the legal problems one would face, too, by trying to bomb or ice a tornado, then  inadvertently hurting someone or destroying private property in the process.  In short -- bad idea!  BACK UP TO THE TOP       How does cloud seeding affect tornadoes?    Nobody knows, for certain. There is no proof that seeding can or cannot change tornado potential in a thunderstorm.   This is because there is no way to know that the things a thunderstorm does after seeding would not have happened  anyway . This includes any presence or lack of rain, hail, wind gusts or tornadoes. Because the effects of seeding are impossible to prove  or disprove, there is a great deal of controversy in meteorology about whether it works, and if so, under what conditions, and  to what extent.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What does a tornado sound like?     That depends on what it is hitting, its size, intensity, closeness and other factors.  The most common tornado sound is a  continuous rumble, like a closeby train.  Sometimes a tornado produces a loud whooshing sound, like that of a waterfall or of open car windows while driving very fast.  Tornadoes which are tearing through densely populated areas may be producing all kinds of  loud noises at once, which collectively may make a tremendous roar.   Just because you may have heard a loud roar during a damaging storm does not necessarily mean it was a tornado .  Any intense thunderstorm wind can produce damage and cause a roar.    BACK UP TO THE TOP      Where can I get tornado pictures?     Photographic   prints of tornadoes are sold by a number of storm chasers  and by the  NSEA Concession . You can see many interesting free weather images at  http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/noaa_products/ . There are also several stock photography agencies specializing in, or peddling on the side, weather photos which include tornadoes. A search engine can help you find online stock photo outfits and tornado photographs. For digital online photos, many tornado-related websites display images; but since all personal photography is legally copyrighted upon creation. Photos on this site and all National Oceanic and Atmospheric (NOAA) agencies, including the National Weather Service, are public domain and free to download, though credit to the agency and/or source is required.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Where can I get video of tornadoes?    Public-domain videos of National Severe Storms Lab tornado intercept footage are available for a reproduction fee through a  video transfer service  used by NSSL.  Many production companies, TV stations and storm chasers have made videotapes of tornadoes available for sale as well.  Try web search engines and storm chaser pages.  This FAQ will not endorse any particular commercial tornado video source or tour operation.   BACK UP TO THE TOP         Do hurricanes and tropical storms produce tornadoes?       Often, but not always.  There are great differences from storm to storm, not  necessarily  related to tropical cyclone size or intensity.  Some landfalling hurricanes in the U.S. fail to produce any known tornadoes, while others cause major outbreaks.  The same hurricane also may have none for awhile, then erupt with tornadoes...or vice versa!  Andrew (1992), for example, spawned several tornadoes across the Deep South after crossing the Gulf, but produced none during its rampage across South Florida.  Katrina (2005) spawned numerous tornadoes after its devastating LA/MS landfall, but only one in Florida (in the Keys).  Though fewer tornadoes tend to occur with tropical depressions and tropical storms than hurricanes, there are notable exceptions like TS Beryl of 1994 in the Carolinas.  Some tropical cyclones even produce two distinct sets of tornadoes -- one around the time of landfall over Florida or the Gulf Coast,  the other when well inland or exiting the Atlantic coast.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      What's the nature of tornadoes in hurricanes and tropical storms?        Hurricane-spawned tornadoes  tend to occur in small, low-topped supercells  within the outer bands, NNW through ESE of the center -- mainly the northeast quadrant.  There, the orientation and speed of the winds create  vertical shear profiles somewhat resembling those around  classic Great Plains supercells  -- the shear being in a shallower layer but often stronger.  Occasionally a tornado will happen in the inner bands as well, but the large majority still form  outside  the hurricane force wind zone.  Because tornado-producing circulations in hurricane supercells tend to be smaller and shorter-lived than their Midwest counterparts,  they are harder to detect on  Doppler radar , and more difficult to warn for.  But hurricane-spawned tornadoes can still be quite deadly and destructive,  as shown by the F3 tornado from Hurricane Andrew at La Place LA (1992, 2 killed) and an F4 tornado at Galveston TX from Hurricane Carla  (1961, 8 killed).    BACK UP TO THE TOP       Do tropical cyclones produce  waterspouts ?       Yes.  Waterspouts -- tornadoes over water -- have been observed in tropical systems.  We don't know how many of them happen in tropical cyclones, but a majority probably are from supercells.  The similarity in  Doppler radar  velocity signatures over water to tornado-producing cells in landfalling hurricanes suggests that it may be common -- and yet another good reason for ships to steer well clear of tropical cyclones.     BACK UP TO THE TOP       Does tropical cyclone strength or size matter for tornadoes?       Often, but not always.  Relatively weak hurricanes like Danny (1985) have spawned significant supercell tornadoes well inland, as have larger, more intense storms like Beulah (1967) and Ivan (2004).  In general, the bigger and stronger the wind fields are with a tropical cyclone, the bigger the area of favorable wind shear for supercells and tornadoes.  But supercell tornadoes (whether or not in tropical cyclones) also depend on instability, lift and moisture.  Surface moisture isn't lacking in a tropical cyclone, but sometimes instability and lift are too weak.  This is why tropical systems tend to produce more tornadoes in the daytime and near any fronts that may get involved in the cyclone circulation.  It is also why SPC won't  always  have tornado watches out for every instance of a tropical cyclone affecting land.  For more details, there is a set of articles on tropical cyclone tornadoes  listed in the  Scientific References  section.  For more information on hurricanes, go to the  Tropical Cyclone FAQ  by Chris Landsea, Neal Dorst and Erica Rule.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      TORNADO FORECASTING      Who forecasts tornadoes?       In the U.S., only the National Weather Service (NWS) issues tornado forecasts nationwide. Warnings come from   each NWS office . The   Storm Prediction Center  issues  watches , general  severe weather outlooks , and  mesoscale discussions . Tornadoes in Canada are handled by the   Meteorological Service of Canada . Very few other nations have specific tornado watch and warning services.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How do you forecast tornadoes?      This is  a  very  simple question with no simple answer!  Here is a  very  generalized view from the perspective of a severe weather forecaster: When predicting severe weather (including tornadoes) a day or two in advance, we look for  the development of temperature and wind flow patterns in the atmosphere which can cause enough  moisture, instability, lift, and wind shear  for tornadic thunderstorms. Those are the four needed ingredients.  But it is not as easy as it sounds.  ""How much is enough"" of those is not a hard fast number, but varies a lot from situation to situation -- and sometimes is unknown!  A large variety of weather patterns can lead to tornadoes; and often, similar patterns may produce no severe weather at all.  To further complicate it, the various computer models we use days in advance can have major biases and flaws when the forecaster tries to interpret them on the scale of thunderstorms.  As the event gets closer, the forecast usually (but not always) loses some uncertainty and narrows down to a more precise threat area.  [At SPC, this is the   transition from outlook to mesoscale discussion to watch .]  Real-time weather observations -- from satellites, weather stations, balloon packages, airplanes, wind profilers and radar-derived winds -- become more and more critical the sooner the thunderstorms are expected; and the models become less important.  To figure out where the thunderstorms will form, we must do some hard, short-fuse detective work:  Find out the location, strength and movement of the fronts,  drylines, outflows, and other boundaries between air masses which tend to provide lift.  Figure out the moisture and temperatures -- both near ground and aloft -- which will help storms form and stay alive in this situation.  Find the wind structures in the atmosphere which can make a thunderstorm rotate as a  supercell , then produce  tornadoes .  [Many supercells never spawn a tornado!]  Make an educated guess where the most favorable combination of  ingredients will be and when; then draw the areas and type the forecast.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       That sounds really hard.   What  hardware and software tools do you use to help you forecast tornadoes?    The most important hardware for forecasting at the  Storm Prediction Center  is the human hand.  Numerous  hand-drawn analyses  of surface and upper-air data are still performed at SPC every day so forecasters can be intimately familiar with the weather features.  SPC forecasters also use high-performance computer workstations (mainly running Unix and Windows 98), with a huge variety of software to display the things we need to help us forecast severe weather.  The variety of those things is enormous:  many kinds of  computer model displays ,  satellite  image  loops,  radar displays ,  wind profiler  and  radar-wind plots ,  data from surface weather stations ,   upper air data from balloons  and planes,  lightning strike plots ,  weather data tables ,  multiple-source overlays , and more. It may sound trite; but by far, the most important software in the tornado forecast process is within the human brain.  The forecaster must use it to sort all that information, toss out what is not needed,  properly interpret what is needed, and put it into a coherent form -- all on a time deadline.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is needed to be a good tornado forecaster?    It all starts with...    Motivation:  Almost all severe storms forecasters are passionate about violent weather, with an intense desire to learn about and become better at predicting it.  For many, this dates back into childhood -- a first-hand encounter with violent storms, images on TV or in books and magazines, or even a deep attraction to storms which goes back too far to recall.  Others start out in other fields or college majors, then became fascinated with severe weather.  In any case, this desire leads to...  Education:  Consistently good severe storms forecasters have a solid educational background in atmospheric science which allows them to understand ""textbook"" concepts of thunderstorm formation.  They don't stop with their college education, either.  They constantly re-educate themselves in the latest discoveries about severe thunderstorms and tornadoes -- reading scientific journal articles on cutting-edge research, perhaps doing some research themselves.  The understanding of storms which results lets the forecaster think of ""conceptual models"" -- visualizations of what the storms will do and how.  Flexibility:  Because the atmosphere doesn't read textbooks or science journals, the forecaster must adapt those ""classroom"" ideas to  an endless variety of day-to-day situations which may look a lot different.  He or she also should be able to recognize when and why a forecast is not working out, and make the right adjustments.  These skills come from...  Experience:  In meteorology, history never repeats itself exactly.  But certain types of situations do recur, allowing the forecaster to set a mental  benchmark for what to expect.  From there, he or she can better decide what data will be most important to examine, and what data  will not be as relevant to the situation.  Experienced forecasters are able to learn how bad forecasts went wrong and how good forecasts worked each time, building a more complete mental warehouse of severe storm forecast knowledge as time passes.  When the experience is  continually blended with motivation, flexibility and more education, he or she will keep improving as a forecaster.    BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is the tornado forecast for next spring?  Are there going to be tornadoes in Iowa the week of next October 5?     We  just don't know.  Tornado forecasting today and tomorrow is quite difficult already.  Specific severe weather forecasting more than days in advance is little more than guessing, or using tornado climatology for the forecast area and time of year.  For that  reason, there is no such thing as a long range severe storm or tornado forecast.  There are simply too  many small-scale variables involved which we cannot reliably measure or model weeks or months ahead of time; so no scientific forecasters even attempt them.  Our farthest convective  outlook is for day-3, and can be found on the  SPC Forecasts page . Perhaps, someday, the density of weather observations and atmospheric modeling capabilities will advance  enough to allow us to do severe storms forecasting many days out with some degree of accuracy better than a coin toss.  We are a long, long way from that kind of forecasting!  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What  is the role of Doppler radar in tornado forecasting?    Each NWS forecast office uses output from at least one  Doppler radar  in the area to help to determine if a  warning  is needed. Doppler radar signatures can tell warning meteorologists a great deal about a thunderstorm's structure, but usually can't see the tornado itself.  This is because the radar beam gets too wide to resolve even the biggest tornadoes within a few tens of miles after leaving the transmitter.  Instead, a radar indicates strong winds blowing toward and away from it in a way that tells forecasters, ""An intense circulation probably exists in this storm and a tornado is possible.""  Possible doesn't mean certain, though.  That is why local forecasters must also depend on spotter reports,  SPC forecast guidance  on the general severe weather threat, and in-house analysis of the weather situation over the region containing thunderstorms, to make the best-informed warning decisions.    BACK UP TO THE TOP      What was the first  successful tornado forecast?    Nobody knows when was the first time someone claimed a tornado would occur in an area, and it happened.  But the first documented, successful tornado forecast by meteorologists was on March 25, 1948, by  Air Force Capt. (later Col.) Robert Miller  and  Major Ernest Fawbush .  After they noticed striking similarities in the developing weather pattern to others which produced tornadoes  (including the Tinker AFB, OK, tornado several days before), Fawbush and Miller advised their superior officer of a tornado threat in central Oklahoma that evening.  Compelled from above to issue a yes/no decision on a tornado forecast after  thunderstorms developed in western Oklahoma, they put out the word of possible tornadoes, and the base carried out safety precautions. A few hours later, despite the tiny odds of a repeat, the second tornado in five days directly hit the base.  For more insight into this event, Charlie Crisp has transcribed the late Col. Miller's recollections of the event; and they   are now online .   BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is the history of tornado forecasting?     It's too long and eventful to summarize here; but there is an  online guide  at NSSL, as well as a  timeline of SELS and SPC , and a  history of the SPC  that provide insight into how tornado prediction has evolved.  There is also an entire book devoted to the subject:   Scanning the Skies : A History of Tornado Forecasting  by Marlene Bradford (hardcover - March 2001).   Some libraries, bookstores and online book sellers carry this comprehensive and detailed history work.     BACK UP TO THE TOP      Was tornado forecasting once banned in the U.S.?      Yes.  Before 1950, at various stages of development of the Weather Bureau, the use of the word ""tornado"" in forecasts was at times strongly discouraged and at other times forbidden, because of a fear that predicting tornadoes may cause panic.  This was in an era when very little was known about tornadoes compared to today, by both scientists and the public at large.  Tornadoes were, for most, dark and mysterious menaces of unfathomable power, fast-striking monsters from the sky capable of sudden and unpredictable acts of death and devastation.  As the weather patterns which led to major tornado events became better documented and researched, the mystery behind predicting them began to clear -- a process which still is far from complete, of course.  In 1950, the Weather Bureau  revoked the ban  (PDF) on mentioning tornadoes in forecasts.  BACK UP TO THE TOP        How has SPC performed with tornado forecasting?     By  most measures, SPC (formerly SELS, NSSFC) has improved its tornado forecasting over the past few decades. There are many ways to objectively gauge forecast performance -- for example,  verifying tornado watches with tornado reports  and  both watch types by all severe reports . The general trend from 1985-2003 has been for a greater percentage of tornado watches to contain tornadoes.    BACK UP TO THE TOP       TORNADO DAMAGE      How is tornado damage rated?    The most widely used method worldwide, for over three decades, was the  F-scale  developed by Dr. T. Theodore Fujita.  In the U.S., and probably elsewhere within a few years, the new  Enhanced F-scale  is becoming the standard for assessing tornado damage. In Britain,  there is a  scale  similar to the original F-scale but with more divisions; for more info, go to   the TORRO scale website .  In both original F- and TORRO-scales, the wind speeds are based on calculations of the   Beaufort wind scale  and have never been scientifically verified in real tornadoes.  Enhanced F-scale winds are derived from engineering guidelines but still are only judgmental estimates.  Because:   Nobody knows the ""true"" wind speeds at ground level in most tornadoes, and   The amount of wind needed to do similar-looking damage can vary greatly, even from block to block or building to building,    ...damage rating is (at best) an exercise in educated guessing.  Even experienced damage-survey meteorologists and wind engineers  can and often do disagree among themselves on a tornado's strength.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Who  surveys tornado damage?  What's the criteria for the National Weather Service to do a survey?    This varies from place to place; and there is no rigid criteria. The responsibility for damage survey decisions at  each NWS office  usually falls on the Warning-Coordination Meteorologist (WCM) and/or the Meteorologist in Charge (MIC). Budget constraints keep every tornado path from having a direct ground survey by NWS personnel; so  spotter, chaser  and news accounts may be used to rate relatively weak, remote or brief tornadoes. Killer tornadoes, those striking densely populated areas, or those generating reports of exceptional damage are given highest priority for ground surveys.  Most ground surveys involve the WCM and/or forecasters not having shift responsibility the day of the survey.  For outbreaks and unusually destructive events -- usually only a few times a year -- the NWS may support involvement by highly experienced damage survey experts and wind engineers from elsewhere in the country.  Aerial  surveys are expensive and usually reserved for tornado events with multiple casualties and/or massive degrees of damage. Sometimes, local NWS offices may have a cooperative agreement with local media or police to use their helicopters during surveys.   BACK UP TO THE TOP        How can a tornado destroy one house and leave the next one almost unscratched?    Most of the time, this happens either with  multiple-vortex  tornadoes or very small, intense single-vortex tornadoes.  The winds in most of a  multivortex tornado  may only be strong enough to do minor damage to a particular house.  But one of the smaller embedded subvortices, perhaps only a few dozen feet across, may strike the house next door with winds over 200 mph, causing complete destruction. Also, there can be great differences in construction from one building to the next, so that even in the same wind speed, one may be flattened while the other is barely nicked.  For example, a flimsy, unanchored mobile home may be  obliterated while all surrounding objects suffer little or no damage .  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How do tornadoes  do some weird things, like drive straw into trees,  strip road pavement and drive splinters into bricks?    The list of bizarre things attributed to tornadoes is almost endless. Much of it is folklore; but there are some weird scenes in tornado damage. Asphalt pavement may strip when tornado winds sandblast the edges with gravel and other small detritus, eroding the edges and causing chunks to peel loose from the road base. Storm chasers and damage surveyors have observed this phenomenon often after the passage of a violent tornado. With a specially designed cannon,   wind engineers at Texas Tech University  have fired boards and other objects at over 100 mph into various types of construction materials, duplicating some of the kinds of ""bizarre"" effects, such as wood splinters embedded in bricks. Intense winds can bend a tree or other objects, creating cracks in which debris (e.g., hay straw) becomes lodged before the tree straightens and the crack tightens shut again. All bizarre damage effects have a physical cause inside the roiling maelstrom of tornado winds. We don't fully understand what some of those causes are yet, however; because much of it is almost impossible to simulate in a lab.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      I've heard about  tornadoes picking up objects and carrying them for miles.  Does this happen? Who does research on it?    Yes, numerous tornadoes have lofted (mainly light) debris many miles into the sky, which was then carried by middle- and upper-atmospheric winds for long distances. The vertical winds in tornadoes can be strong enough to temporarily levitate even heavy objects if they have a large face to the wind or flat sides (like roofs, walls, trees and cars),  and are strong enough to carry lightweight objects tens of thousands of feet high.  Though the heaviest objects, such as railroad cars, can only be airborne for short distances, stories of checks and other papers found over 100 miles  away are often true. The Worcester MA tornado of 9 June 1953 carried mattress pieces high into the thunderstorm, where they were coated in ice, before they fell into Boston Harbor. Pilots reported seeing debris fluttering through the air at high altitude near the thunderstorm which spawned the Ruskin Heights MO tornado of 20 May 1957. There is a   research group at the University of Oklahoma  which studies tornado debris flight. If you personally know of a case of tornado debris carried long-distance, they have a hotline you can call to report it.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How does the damage from tornadoes compare to that of hurricanes?     The differences are in scale.  Even though winds from the strongest tornadoes far exceed that from the strongest hurricanes, hurricanes typically cause much more damage individually and over a season, and over far bigger areas.  Economically, tornadoes cause about a tenth as much damage per year, on average, as hurricanes.  Hurricanes tend to cause much more overall destruction than tornadoes because of their much larger size, longer duration and their greater variety of ways to damage property.  The destructive core in hurricanes can be tens of miles across, last many hours and damage structures through storm surge and rainfall-caused flooding, as well as from wind.  Tornadoes, in contrast, tend to be a few hundred yards in diameter, last for minutes and primarily cause damage from their extreme winds.      Where can I find free pictures of tornado damage?        We have some public domain images of typical examples of F0 through F5 tornado damage linked from this FAQ's  F-scale page .   Otherwise, public-domain tornado damage pictures are scattered among various National Weather Service websites.   Because web addresses change so often, we don't maintain a listing of them here; but you can start your search at  this map of all NWS websites . Browse around for damage survey photos in severe weather and tornado event sections of  local NWS office pages ; and  please make sure the photos are not copyrighted before using them . If there are any doubts, or to get permission to use copyrighted  material, e-mail the webmaster at that office.  SPC  has some public-domain images and descriptions of Spencer, SD tornado damage available  here . If you want hardcopies for research projects, the best bet is to download and print public-domain images from a high-quality color printer. Even when using public-domain images, you should give proper credit to the source. Historical archives at local and college libraries might have public-domain hardcopy prints of historical tornado damage in your area.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       TORNADO SAFETY      What should I do in case of a tornado?    That depends on where you are.   This list of tornado safety tips  covers most situations.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is a tornado watch?      A  tornado  watch defines an area shaped like a parallelogram, where tornadoes and other kinds of severe  weather are possible in the next several hours.  It does not mean tornadoes are imminent -- just that you need  to be alert, and to be prepared to go to safe shelter if tornadoes do happen or a warning is issued.  This is the time to turn on local TV or radio, turn on and set the alarm switch on your weather radio, make sure you have ready access to safe shelter, and make your friends and family aware of the potential for tornadoes in the area.  The  Storm Prediction Center  issues tornado and severe thunderstorm watches;  here is an example .  For more information on tornado watches and other SPC bulletins,  go here .  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is a tornado warning?    A tornado warning means that a tornado has been spotted, or that  Doppler radar  indicates a thunderstorm circulation which can spawn a tornado. When a tornado warning is issued for your town or county, take immediate   safety  precautions.  local NWS offices  issue tornado warnings.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Do  mobile homes attract tornadoes?    Of course not.  It may seem that way, considering most tornado deaths occur in them, and that some of the most graphic reports of tornado damage come from mobile home communities.  The reason for this is that mobile homes are, in general, much easier for a tornado to damage and destroy than well-built houses and office buildings.  A brief, relatively weak tornado which may have gone undetected in the wilderness -- or  misclassified as severe straight-line thunderstorm winds while doing minor damage to sturdy houses -- can  blow a mobile home apart .  Historically, mobile home parks have been reliable  indicators , not attractors, of tornadoes.  BACK UP TO THE TOP   "

ABOUT THIS FAQ      Last modified 26 May 2008        This list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) has been compiled from questions asked of the SPC as well as basic tornado research information and countless scientific resources.  More material will be added, time permitting.  If you find a link not working or an error of any sort, please  e-mail the FAQ author .     The  Tornado FAQ is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to tornadoes. Instead, it is a quick-reference summary of tornado knowledge, which will link you to more detailed information if you desire. Recent books from your local library or a major university library are still the deepest resource for learning about tornadoes and other  severe storms; so if you are doing your own research or school reports, please visit the library in person. There are many good websites with tornado information also. Some of them are linked from the answers below. None of the links to outside websites implies any kind of commercial endorsement on the part of the SPC. The intent here is to direct you to the best tornado info available. There is also a partial  list of technical scientific references  related to tornadoes for  those with some meteorological education and training.

Complete Tornado FAQ content is found at the  mirror-backup site .        THE BASICS ABOUT TORNADOES      What is a tornado?     According  to the  Glossary of Meteorology  (AMS 2000), a tornado is  ""a violently rotating column of air, pendant  from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud.""   Literally, in order for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with the ground  and  the cloud base.  Weather scientists haven't found it so simple in practice, however, to classify and define tornadoes.  For example, the difference is unclear between an strong mesocyclone (parent thunderstorm circulation) on the ground, and a large, weak tornado.  There is also disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. It is well-known that a tornado may  not have a visible funnel . Also, at what wind speed of the cloud-to-ground vortex does a tornado begin?   How close must two or more different tornadic circulations become to qualify as a one  multiple-vortex tornado , instead of separate tornadoes?  There are no firm answers.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How  do tornadoes form?    The classic answer -- ""warm moist Gulf air meets cold Canadian air and dry air from the Rockies"" -- is a gross oversimplification.  Many thunderstorms  form under those conditions (near warm fronts, cold fronts and drylines respectively), which never even come close  to producing tornadoes.   Even  when the large-scale environment is extremely favorable for tornadic thunderstorms, as in an SPC ""High Risk"" outlook, not every thunderstorm spawns a tornado.  The truth is that we don't fully understand.   The   most  destructive and deadly tornadoes occur from  supercells  -- which are rotating thunderstorms with a well-defined radar circulation called a    mesocyclone .   [Supercells   can  also produce  damaging hail , severe non-tornadic winds, unusually frequent  lightning , and  flash floods .] Tornado formation is believed to be dictated mainly by things which happen  on the storm scale , in and around the mesocyclone.   Recent theories and results from the  VORTEX  program suggest that once a mesocyclone is underway, tornado  development is related to the temperature differences across the edge of downdraft air wrapping around the mesocyclone (the   occlusion downdraft ).  Mathematical modeling studies of tornado formation also indicate that it can happen without such temperature patterns; and in fact, very little temperature variation was observed near some of the most destructive tornadoes in history on  3 May 1999 .  The details behind these theories are given in several of the  Scientific References  accompanying this FAQ.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       What direction  do tornadoes come from?  Does the region of the US play a role in path direction?       Tornadoes can appear from any direction.  Most move from southwest to northeast, or west to east.  Some tornadoes have changed direction amid path, or even backtracked.  [A tornado can double back suddenly, for example, when its bottom is hit by outflow winds from a thunderstorm's core.]  Some areas of the US  tend  to have more paths from a specific direction, such as northwest in Minnesota or southeast in coastal south Texas.  This is because of an increased frequency of certain tornado-producing weather patterns (say, hurricanes in south Texas, or northwest-flow weather systems in the upper Midwest).    BACK UP TO THE TOP      Does  hail always come before the tornado?  Rain?   Lightning ?  Utter silence?    Not necessarily, for any of those.  Rain, wind,  lightning ,  and  hail  characteristics vary from storm to storm, from one hour to the next, and even with the direction the storm is moving with respect to the observer.  While large hail  can  indicate the presence of an unusually dangerous thunderstorm, and  can  happen before a tornado, don't depend on it.  Hail, or any particular pattern of rain, lightning or calmness, is not a reliable predictor of tornado threat.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      How  do tornadoes dissipate?    The details are still debated by tornado scientists.  We do know tornadoes need a source of instability (heat, moisture, etc.) and a larger-scale property of rotation ( vorticity ) to keep going.  There are a lot of processes around a thunderstorm which can possibly rob the area around a tornado of either instability or vorticity.  One is relatively cold  outflow  -- the flow of wind out of the precipitation area of a shower or thunderstorm.  Many tornadoes have been observed to go away soon after being hit by outflow.  For decades, storm observers have documented the death of numerous tornadoes when their parent circulations ( mesocyclones ) weaken after they become wrapped in outflow air -- either from the same thunderstorm or a different one.  The irony is that some kinds of thunderstorm outflow may help to  cause  tornadoes, while other forms of outflow may  kill  tornadoes.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      Do tornadoes really skip?     Not in a literal sense, despite what you may have read in many older references, news stories, or even damage survey reports.  By definition (above), a tornado must be in  contact with the ground.  There is disagreement in meteorology over whether or not multiple touchdowns of the same vortex or  funnel cloud  mean different tornadoes (a strict interpretation).  In either event, stories of skipping tornadoes usually mean    There was continuous contact between vortex and ground in the path, but it was too weak to do damage;   Multiple tornadoes happened; but there was no survey done to precisely separate their paths (very common before the 1970s); or  There were multiple tornadoes with only short separation, but the survey erroneously classified them as one tornado.    BACK UP TO THE TOP      How long does a tornado last?    Tornadoes can last from several seconds to more than an hour.  The longest-lived tornado in history is really unknown, because so many of the long-lived tornadoes reported from the early-mid 1900s and before are believed to be tornado series instead.  Most tornadoes last less than 10 minutes.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      How close to a tornado does the barometer drop?  And how far does it drop ?     It varies. A barometer can start dropping many hours or even days in advance of a tornado if there is low pressure on a broad scale moving into the area. Strong pressure falls will often happen as the mesocyclone (parent circulation in the thunderstorm) moves overhead or nearby. The biggest drop will be in the tornado itself, of course. It is very hard to measure pressure in tornadoes since most weather instruments can't survive. A few low-lying, armored probes called "" turtles "" have been placed successfully in tornadoes. This includes one deployment on 15 May 2003 by engineer/storm chaser Tim Samaras, who recorded pressure fall of over 40 millibars through an unusually large tornado. On 24 June 2003, another of Tim's probes recorded a  100 millibar  pressure plunge in a violent tornado near Manchester, SD ( National Geographic report ). Despite those spectacular results, and a few fortuitous passes over barometers through history, we still do not have a database of tornado pressures big enough to say much about average tornado pressures or other barometric characteristics.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is a waterspout?    A waterspout is a  tornado over water  -- usually meaning non-supercell tornadoes over water.  Waterspouts are common along the southeast U.S. coast -- especially off southern Florida and the Keys -- and can happen over seas, bays and lakes worldwide.  Although waterspouts are always tornadoes by definition; they don't officially count in tornado records unless they hit land.  They are smaller and weaker than the most intense Great Plains tornadoes, but still can be quite dangerous.  Waterspouts can overturn small boats, damage ships, do significant damage when hitting land, and kill people.  The  National Weather Service  will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters, or tornado warnings when waterspouts can move onshore.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      How are tornadoes in the northern hemisphere different from tornadoes in the southern hemisphere?    The sense of rotation is usually the opposite. Most tornadoes -- but not all! -- rotate  cyclonically , which is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise south of the equator.  Anticyclonic tornadoes  (clockwise-spinning in the northern hemisphere) have been observed, however -- usually in the form of waterspouts, non-supercell land tornadoes, or anticyclonic whirls around the rim of a supercell's mesocyclone. There have been several documented cases of cyclonic and anticyclonic tornadoes under the same thunderstorm at the same time. Anticyclonically rotating supercells with tornadoes are extremely rare; but  one struck near Sunnyvale, CA , in 1998. Remember, ""cyclonic"" tornadoes spin counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What  is a multivortex  tornado ?   Multivortex (a.k.a. multiple-vortex) tornadoes contain two or more small, intense  subvortices  orbiting the center of the larger tornado circulation.  When a tornado doesn't contain too much dust and debris,  they can sometimes be spectacularly  visible .  These vortices may form and die within a few seconds, sometimes appearing to train through the same part of the tornado one after another.  They can happen in all sorts of tornado sizes, from huge "" wedge "" tornadoes to narrow "" rope "" tornadoes. Subvortices are the cause of most of the narrow, short, extreme swaths of damage that sometimes arc through tornado tracks.  From the air, they can preferentially mow down crops and stack the stubble, leaving  cycloidal marks in fields .  Multivortex tornadoes are the source of most of the old stories from newspapers and other media before the late  20th century which told of several tornadoes seen together at once.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is the original F-scale?    Dr. T. Theodore Fujita developed a damage scale (Fujita 1971, Fujita and Pearson 1973) for winds, including tornadoes, which was supposed to relate the degree of damage to the intensity of the wind.   This scale was the result.  The original F-scale should not be used anymore, because it has been replaced by  an enhanced version .  Tornado wind speeds are still largely unknown; and  the wind speeds on the original F-scale have never been scientifically tested and proven . Different winds may be needed to cause the same damage depending on how well-built a structure is, wind direction, wind duration,  battering by flying debris, and a bunch of other factors.  Also, the process of rating the damage itself is largely a judgment call -- quite inconsistent and arbitrary (Doswell and Burgess, 1988).  Even  meteorologists and engineers highly experienced in damage survey techniques often came up with different F-scale ratings for the same damage.  Even with all its flaws, the original F-scale was the only widely used tornado rating method for over three decades.  The  enhanced F-scale  takes effect 1 February 2007.   BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is the Enhanced F-scale?     The Enhanced F-scale  ( simple table  or detailed  95 page PDF ) is a much more precise and robust way to assess tornado damage than the  original .  It classifies F0-F5 damage as calibrated by engineers and meteorologists across 28 different types of damage indicators (mainly various kinds of buildings, but also a few other structures as well as trees).  The idea is that a ""one size fits all"" approach just doesn't work in rating tornado damage, and that a tornado scale needs to take into account the typical strengths and weaknesses of different types of construction.  This is because the same wind does different things to different kinds of structures.  In the Enhanced F-scale, there will be different, customized standards for assigning any given F rating to a well built, well anchored wood-frame house compared to a garage, school, skyscraper, unanchored house, barn, factory, utility pole or other type of structure.  In a real-life tornado track, these ratings can be mapped together more smoothly to make a damage analysis.  Of course, there still will be gaps and weaknesses on a track where there was little or nothing to damage, but such problems will be less common than under the  original F-scale .  As with the original F-scale, the enhanced version will rate the tornado as a whole based on most intense damage within the path.    There are no plans to systematically re-evaluate historical tornadoes using the Enhanced F-scale.   A full PDF document on the Enhanced F-scale is online .  BACK UP TO THE TOP        So if the original F-scale winds are just guesses, why are they so specific?    Excellent question.  Those winds were arbitrarily attached to the damage scale based on 12-step mathematical interpolation between the hurricane criteria of the  Beaufort wind scale , and the threshold for Mach 1 (738 mph).  Though the F-scale actually peaks at F12 (Mach 1), only F1 through F5 are used in practice, with F0 attached for tornadoes of winds weaker than hurricane force.  Again, F-scale wind-to-damage relationships are untested, unknown and purely hypothetical.  They have never been proven and may not represent real tornadoes.  F-scale winds should not be taken literally.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      I heard the Oklahoma City tornado was almost ""F6.""  Is that a real  level on the original F-scale?    Only in untested theory.  Fujita plotted hypothetical winds higher than F5; but as mentioned in the previous answer above, they were only guesses.  Even if the winds measured by portable Doppler radar (32 meters above ground level, roughly 302 mph)  had been over 318 mph, the tornado would still be rated ""only"" F5 since F5 is the  most intense possible damage level .  On the  Enhanced F-scale , there is no such thing as ""F6.""    BACK UP TO THE TOP        What is a ""significant"" tornado?    A tornado is classified as ""significant"" if it does F2 or greater damage on the  Enhanced F scale . Grazulis (1993) also included killer tornadoes of any damage scale in his significant tornado database.   It is important to know that those definitions are arbitrary, for scientific research.  No tornado is  necessarily  in significant.  Any tornado can kill or cause damage; and some tornadoes rated less than F2  probably could do F2 or greater damage if they hit a well-built house during peak intensity.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       Big  fat tornadoes are the strongest ones, right?     Not necessarily. There is a statistical trend (as  documented  by NSSL's Harold Brooks) toward wide tornadoes having higher  F-scale  damage.  This can be out of more strength or out of greater opportunity for targets to damage -- or some blend of both.  However, the size or shape of  any particular tornado  does not say anything conclusive about its strength.  Some small "" rope ""  tornadoes can still do violent damage of  F4 or F5 ; and some very large tornadoes over a quarter-mile wide have  produced only weak damage of  F0 to F1 .    BACK UP TO THE TOP      Can't  we weaken or destroy tornadoes somehow, like by bombing them or sucking out their heat with a bunch of dry ice?    The main problem with anything which could  realistically stand a chance at affecting a tornado (e.g., hydrogen bomb) is that it would be even more deadly and  destructive than the tornado itself.  Lesser things (like huge piles of dry ice or smaller conventional weaponry)  would be too hard to deploy in the right place fast enough, and would likely not have enough impact to affect the  tornado much anyway.  Imagine the legal problems one would face, too, by trying to bomb or ice a tornado, then  inadvertently hurting someone or destroying private property in the process.  In short -- bad idea!  BACK UP TO THE TOP       How does cloud seeding affect tornadoes?    Nobody knows, for certain. There is no proof that seeding can or cannot change tornado potential in a thunderstorm.   This is because there is no way to know that the things a thunderstorm does after seeding would not have happened  anyway . This includes any presence or lack of rain, hail, wind gusts or tornadoes. Because the effects of seeding are impossible to prove  or disprove, there is a great deal of controversy in meteorology about whether it works, and if so, under what conditions, and  to what extent.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What does a tornado sound like?     That depends on what it is hitting, its size, intensity, closeness and other factors.  The most common tornado sound is a  continuous rumble, like a closeby train.  Sometimes a tornado produces a loud whooshing sound, like that of a waterfall or of open car windows while driving very fast.  Tornadoes which are tearing through densely populated areas may be producing all kinds of  loud noises at once, which collectively may make a tremendous roar.   Just because you may have heard a loud roar during a damaging storm does not necessarily mean it was a tornado .  Any intense thunderstorm wind can produce damage and cause a roar.    BACK UP TO THE TOP      Where can I get tornado pictures?     Photographic   prints of tornadoes are sold by a number of storm chasers  and by the  NSEA Concession . You can see many interesting free weather images at  http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/noaa_products/ . There are also several stock photography agencies specializing in, or peddling on the side, weather photos which include tornadoes. A search engine can help you find online stock photo outfits and tornado photographs. For digital online photos, many tornado-related websites display images; but since all personal photography is legally copyrighted upon creation. Photos on this site and all National Oceanic and Atmospheric (NOAA) agencies, including the National Weather Service, are public domain and free to download, though credit to the agency and/or source is required.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Where can I get video of tornadoes?    Public-domain videos of National Severe Storms Lab tornado intercept footage are available for a reproduction fee through a  video transfer service  used by NSSL.  Many production companies, TV stations and storm chasers have made videotapes of tornadoes available for sale as well.  Try web search engines and storm chaser pages.  This FAQ will not endorse any particular commercial tornado video source or tour operation.   BACK UP TO THE TOP         Do hurricanes and tropical storms produce tornadoes?       Often, but not always.  There are great differences from storm to storm, not  necessarily  related to tropical cyclone size or intensity.  Some landfalling hurricanes in the U.S. fail to produce any known tornadoes, while others cause major outbreaks.  The same hurricane also may have none for awhile, then erupt with tornadoes...or vice versa!  Andrew (1992), for example, spawned several tornadoes across the Deep South after crossing the Gulf, but produced none during its rampage across South Florida.  Katrina (2005) spawned numerous tornadoes after its devastating LA/MS landfall, but only one in Florida (in the Keys).  Though fewer tornadoes tend to occur with tropical depressions and tropical storms than hurricanes, there are notable exceptions like TS Beryl of 1994 in the Carolinas.  Some tropical cyclones even produce two distinct sets of tornadoes -- one around the time of landfall over Florida or the Gulf Coast,  the other when well inland or exiting the Atlantic coast.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      What's the nature of tornadoes in hurricanes and tropical storms?        Hurricane-spawned tornadoes  tend to occur in small, low-topped supercells  within the outer bands, NNW through ESE of the center -- mainly the northeast quadrant.  There, the orientation and speed of the winds create  vertical shear profiles somewhat resembling those around  classic Great Plains supercells  -- the shear being in a shallower layer but often stronger.  Occasionally a tornado will happen in the inner bands as well, but the large majority still form  outside  the hurricane force wind zone.  Because tornado-producing circulations in hurricane supercells tend to be smaller and shorter-lived than their Midwest counterparts,  they are harder to detect on  Doppler radar , and more difficult to warn for.  But hurricane-spawned tornadoes can still be quite deadly and destructive,  as shown by the F3 tornado from Hurricane Andrew at La Place LA (1992, 2 killed) and an F4 tornado at Galveston TX from Hurricane Carla  (1961, 8 killed).    BACK UP TO THE TOP       Do tropical cyclones produce  waterspouts ?       Yes.  Waterspouts -- tornadoes over water -- have been observed in tropical systems.  We don't know how many of them happen in tropical cyclones, but a majority probably are from supercells.  The similarity in  Doppler radar  velocity signatures over water to tornado-producing cells in landfalling hurricanes suggests that it may be common -- and yet another good reason for ships to steer well clear of tropical cyclones.     BACK UP TO THE TOP       Does tropical cyclone strength or size matter for tornadoes?       Often, but not always.  Relatively weak hurricanes like Danny (1985) have spawned significant supercell tornadoes well inland, as have larger, more intense storms like Beulah (1967) and Ivan (2004).  In general, the bigger and stronger the wind fields are with a tropical cyclone, the bigger the area of favorable wind shear for supercells and tornadoes.  But supercell tornadoes (whether or not in tropical cyclones) also depend on instability, lift and moisture.  Surface moisture isn't lacking in a tropical cyclone, but sometimes instability and lift are too weak.  This is why tropical systems tend to produce more tornadoes in the daytime and near any fronts that may get involved in the cyclone circulation.  It is also why SPC won't  always  have tornado watches out for every instance of a tropical cyclone affecting land.  For more details, there is a set of articles on tropical cyclone tornadoes  listed in the  Scientific References  section.  For more information on hurricanes, go to the  Tropical Cyclone FAQ  by Chris Landsea, Neal Dorst and Erica Rule.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      TORNADO FORECASTING      Who forecasts tornadoes?       In the U.S., only the National Weather Service (NWS) issues tornado forecasts nationwide. Warnings come from   each NWS office . The   Storm Prediction Center  issues  watches , general  severe weather outlooks , and  mesoscale discussions . Tornadoes in Canada are handled by the   Meteorological Service of Canada . Very few other nations have specific tornado watch and warning services.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How do you forecast tornadoes?      This is  a  very  simple question with no simple answer!  Here is a  very  generalized view from the perspective of a severe weather forecaster: When predicting severe weather (including tornadoes) a day or two in advance, we look for  the development of temperature and wind flow patterns in the atmosphere which can cause enough  moisture, instability, lift, and wind shear  for tornadic thunderstorms. Those are the four needed ingredients.  But it is not as easy as it sounds.  ""How much is enough"" of those is not a hard fast number, but varies a lot from situation to situation -- and sometimes is unknown!  A large variety of weather patterns can lead to tornadoes; and often, similar patterns may produce no severe weather at all.  To further complicate it, the various computer models we use days in advance can have major biases and flaws when the forecaster tries to interpret them on the scale of thunderstorms.  As the event gets closer, the forecast usually (but not always) loses some uncertainty and narrows down to a more precise threat area.  [At SPC, this is the   transition from outlook to mesoscale discussion to watch .]  Real-time weather observations -- from satellites, weather stations, balloon packages, airplanes, wind profilers and radar-derived winds -- become more and more critical the sooner the thunderstorms are expected; and the models become less important.  To figure out where the thunderstorms will form, we must do some hard, short-fuse detective work:  Find out the location, strength and movement of the fronts,  drylines, outflows, and other boundaries between air masses which tend to provide lift.  Figure out the moisture and temperatures -- both near ground and aloft -- which will help storms form and stay alive in this situation.  Find the wind structures in the atmosphere which can make a thunderstorm rotate as a  supercell , then produce  tornadoes .  [Many supercells never spawn a tornado!]  Make an educated guess where the most favorable combination of  ingredients will be and when; then draw the areas and type the forecast.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       That sounds really hard.   What  hardware and software tools do you use to help you forecast tornadoes?    The most important hardware for forecasting at the  Storm Prediction Center  is the human hand.  Numerous  hand-drawn analyses  of surface and upper-air data are still performed at SPC every day so forecasters can be intimately familiar with the weather features.  SPC forecasters also use high-performance computer workstations (mainly running Unix and Windows 98), with a huge variety of software to display the things we need to help us forecast severe weather.  The variety of those things is enormous:  many kinds of  computer model displays ,  satellite  image  loops,  radar displays ,  wind profiler  and  radar-wind plots ,  data from surface weather stations ,   upper air data from balloons  and planes,  lightning strike plots ,  weather data tables ,  multiple-source overlays , and more. It may sound trite; but by far, the most important software in the tornado forecast process is within the human brain.  The forecaster must use it to sort all that information, toss out what is not needed,  properly interpret what is needed, and put it into a coherent form -- all on a time deadline.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is needed to be a good tornado forecaster?    It all starts with...    Motivation:  Almost all severe storms forecasters are passionate about violent weather, with an intense desire to learn about and become better at predicting it.  For many, this dates back into childhood -- a first-hand encounter with violent storms, images on TV or in books and magazines, or even a deep attraction to storms which goes back too far to recall.  Others start out in other fields or college majors, then became fascinated with severe weather.  In any case, this desire leads to...  Education:  Consistently good severe storms forecasters have a solid educational background in atmospheric science which allows them to understand ""textbook"" concepts of thunderstorm formation.  They don't stop with their college education, either.  They constantly re-educate themselves in the latest discoveries about severe thunderstorms and tornadoes -- reading scientific journal articles on cutting-edge research, perhaps doing some research themselves.  The understanding of storms which results lets the forecaster think of ""conceptual models"" -- visualizations of what the storms will do and how.  Flexibility:  Because the atmosphere doesn't read textbooks or science journals, the forecaster must adapt those ""classroom"" ideas to  an endless variety of day-to-day situations which may look a lot different.  He or she also should be able to recognize when and why a forecast is not working out, and make the right adjustments.  These skills come from...  Experience:  In meteorology, history never repeats itself exactly.  But certain types of situations do recur, allowing the forecaster to set a mental  benchmark for what to expect.  From there, he or she can better decide what data will be most important to examine, and what data  will not be as relevant to the situation.  Experienced forecasters are able to learn how bad forecasts went wrong and how good forecasts worked each time, building a more complete mental warehouse of severe storm forecast knowledge as time passes.  When the experience is  continually blended with motivation, flexibility and more education, he or she will keep improving as a forecaster.    BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is the tornado forecast for next spring?  Are there going to be tornadoes in Iowa the week of next October 5?     We  just don't know.  Tornado forecasting today and tomorrow is quite difficult already.  Specific severe weather forecasting more than days in advance is little more than guessing, or using tornado climatology for the forecast area and time of year.  For that  reason, there is no such thing as a long range severe storm or tornado forecast.  There are simply too  many small-scale variables involved which we cannot reliably measure or model weeks or months ahead of time; so no scientific forecasters even attempt them.  Our farthest convective  outlook is for day-3, and can be found on the  SPC Forecasts page . Perhaps, someday, the density of weather observations and atmospheric modeling capabilities will advance  enough to allow us to do severe storms forecasting many days out with some degree of accuracy better than a coin toss.  We are a long, long way from that kind of forecasting!  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What  is the role of Doppler radar in tornado forecasting?    Each NWS forecast office uses output from at least one  Doppler radar  in the area to help to determine if a  warning  is needed. Doppler radar signatures can tell warning meteorologists a great deal about a thunderstorm's structure, but usually can't see the tornado itself.  This is because the radar beam gets too wide to resolve even the biggest tornadoes within a few tens of miles after leaving the transmitter.  Instead, a radar indicates strong winds blowing toward and away from it in a way that tells forecasters, ""An intense circulation probably exists in this storm and a tornado is possible.""  Possible doesn't mean certain, though.  That is why local forecasters must also depend on spotter reports,  SPC forecast guidance  on the general severe weather threat, and in-house analysis of the weather situation over the region containing thunderstorms, to make the best-informed warning decisions.    BACK UP TO THE TOP      What was the first  successful tornado forecast?    Nobody knows when was the first time someone claimed a tornado would occur in an area, and it happened.  But the first documented, successful tornado forecast by meteorologists was on March 25, 1948, by  Air Force Capt. (later Col.) Robert Miller  and  Major Ernest Fawbush .  After they noticed striking similarities in the developing weather pattern to others which produced tornadoes  (including the Tinker AFB, OK, tornado several days before), Fawbush and Miller advised their superior officer of a tornado threat in central Oklahoma that evening.  Compelled from above to issue a yes/no decision on a tornado forecast after  thunderstorms developed in western Oklahoma, they put out the word of possible tornadoes, and the base carried out safety precautions. A few hours later, despite the tiny odds of a repeat, the second tornado in five days directly hit the base.  For more insight into this event, Charlie Crisp has transcribed the late Col. Miller's recollections of the event; and they   are now online .   BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is the history of tornado forecasting?     It's too long and eventful to summarize here; but there is an  online guide  at NSSL, as well as a  timeline of SELS and SPC , and a  history of the SPC  that provide insight into how tornado prediction has evolved.  There is also an entire book devoted to the subject:   Scanning the Skies : A History of Tornado Forecasting  by Marlene Bradford (hardcover - March 2001).   Some libraries, bookstores and online book sellers carry this comprehensive and detailed history work.     BACK UP TO THE TOP      Was tornado forecasting once banned in the U.S.?      Yes.  Before 1950, at various stages of development of the Weather Bureau, the use of the word ""tornado"" in forecasts was at times strongly discouraged and at other times forbidden, because of a fear that predicting tornadoes may cause panic.  This was in an era when very little was known about tornadoes compared to today, by both scientists and the public at large.  Tornadoes were, for most, dark and mysterious menaces of unfathomable power, fast-striking monsters from the sky capable of sudden and unpredictable acts of death and devastation.  As the weather patterns which led to major tornado events became better documented and researched, the mystery behind predicting them began to clear -- a process which still is far from complete, of course.  In 1950, the Weather Bureau  revoked the ban  (PDF) on mentioning tornadoes in forecasts.  BACK UP TO THE TOP        How has SPC performed with tornado forecasting?     By  most measures, SPC (formerly SELS, NSSFC) has improved its tornado forecasting over the past few decades. There are many ways to objectively gauge forecast performance -- for example,  verifying tornado watches with tornado reports  and  both watch types by all severe reports . The general trend from 1985-2003 has been for a greater percentage of tornado watches to contain tornadoes.    BACK UP TO THE TOP       TORNADO DAMAGE      How is tornado damage rated?    The most widely used method worldwide, for over three decades, was the  F-scale  developed by Dr. T. Theodore Fujita.  In the U.S., and probably elsewhere within a few years, the new  Enhanced F-scale  is becoming the standard for assessing tornado damage. In Britain,  there is a  scale  similar to the original F-scale but with more divisions; for more info, go to   the TORRO scale website .  In both original F- and TORRO-scales, the wind speeds are based on calculations of the   Beaufort wind scale  and have never been scientifically verified in real tornadoes.  Enhanced F-scale winds are derived from engineering guidelines but still are only judgmental estimates.  Because:   Nobody knows the ""true"" wind speeds at ground level in most tornadoes, and   The amount of wind needed to do similar-looking damage can vary greatly, even from block to block or building to building,    ...damage rating is (at best) an exercise in educated guessing.  Even experienced damage-survey meteorologists and wind engineers  can and often do disagree among themselves on a tornado's strength.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Who  surveys tornado damage?  What's the criteria for the National Weather Service to do a survey?    This varies from place to place; and there is no rigid criteria. The responsibility for damage survey decisions at  each NWS office  usually falls on the Warning-Coordination Meteorologist (WCM) and/or the Meteorologist in Charge (MIC). Budget constraints keep every tornado path from having a direct ground survey by NWS personnel; so  spotter, chaser  and news accounts may be used to rate relatively weak, remote or brief tornadoes. Killer tornadoes, those striking densely populated areas, or those generating reports of exceptional damage are given highest priority for ground surveys.  Most ground surveys involve the WCM and/or forecasters not having shift responsibility the day of the survey.  For outbreaks and unusually destructive events -- usually only a few times a year -- the NWS may support involvement by highly experienced damage survey experts and wind engineers from elsewhere in the country.  Aerial  surveys are expensive and usually reserved for tornado events with multiple casualties and/or massive degrees of damage. Sometimes, local NWS offices may have a cooperative agreement with local media or police to use their helicopters during surveys.   BACK UP TO THE TOP        How can a tornado destroy one house and leave the next one almost unscratched?    Most of the time, this happens either with  multiple-vortex  tornadoes or very small, intense single-vortex tornadoes.  The winds in most of a  multivortex tornado  may only be strong enough to do minor damage to a particular house.  But one of the smaller embedded subvortices, perhaps only a few dozen feet across, may strike the house next door with winds over 200 mph, causing complete destruction. Also, there can be great differences in construction from one building to the next, so that even in the same wind speed, one may be flattened while the other is barely nicked.  For example, a flimsy, unanchored mobile home may be  obliterated while all surrounding objects suffer little or no damage .  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How do tornadoes  do some weird things, like drive straw into trees,  strip road pavement and drive splinters into bricks?    The list of bizarre things attributed to tornadoes is almost endless. Much of it is folklore; but there are some weird scenes in tornado damage. Asphalt pavement may strip when tornado winds sandblast the edges with gravel and other small detritus, eroding the edges and causing chunks to peel loose from the road base. Storm chasers and damage surveyors have observed this phenomenon often after the passage of a violent tornado. With a specially designed cannon,   wind engineers at Texas Tech University  have fired boards and other objects at over 100 mph into various types of construction materials, duplicating some of the kinds of ""bizarre"" effects, such as wood splinters embedded in bricks. Intense winds can bend a tree or other objects, creating cracks in which debris (e.g., hay straw) becomes lodged before the tree straightens and the crack tightens shut again. All bizarre damage effects have a physical cause inside the roiling maelstrom of tornado winds. We don't fully understand what some of those causes are yet, however; because much of it is almost impossible to simulate in a lab.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      I've heard about  tornadoes picking up objects and carrying them for miles.  Does this happen? Who does research on it?    Yes, numerous tornadoes have lofted (mainly light) debris many miles into the sky, which was then carried by middle- and upper-atmospheric winds for long distances. The vertical winds in tornadoes can be strong enough to temporarily levitate even heavy objects if they have a large face to the wind or flat sides (like roofs, walls, trees and cars),  and are strong enough to carry lightweight objects tens of thousands of feet high.  Though the heaviest objects, such as railroad cars, can only be airborne for short distances, stories of checks and other papers found over 100 miles  away are often true. The Worcester MA tornado of 9 June 1953 carried mattress pieces high into the thunderstorm, where they were coated in ice, before they fell into Boston Harbor. Pilots reported seeing debris fluttering through the air at high altitude near the thunderstorm which spawned the Ruskin Heights MO tornado of 20 May 1957. There is a   research group at the University of Oklahoma  which studies tornado debris flight. If you personally know of a case of tornado debris carried long-distance, they have a hotline you can call to report it.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How does the damage from tornadoes compare to that of hurricanes?     The differences are in scale.  Even though winds from the strongest tornadoes far exceed that from the strongest hurricanes, hurricanes typically cause much more damage individually and over a season, and over far bigger areas.  Economically, tornadoes cause about a tenth as much damage per year, on average, as hurricanes.  Hurricanes tend to cause much more overall destruction than tornadoes because of their much larger size, longer duration and their greater variety of ways to damage property.  The destructive core in hurricanes can be tens of miles across, last many hours and damage structures through storm surge and rainfall-caused flooding, as well as from wind.  Tornadoes, in contrast, tend to be a few hundred yards in diameter, last for minutes and primarily cause damage from their extreme winds.      Where can I find free pictures of tornado damage?        We have some public domain images of typical examples of F0 through F5 tornado damage linked from this FAQ's  F-scale page .   Otherwise, public-domain tornado damage pictures are scattered among various National Weather Service websites.   Because web addresses change so often, we don't maintain a listing of them here; but you can start your search at  this map of all NWS websites . Browse around for damage survey photos in severe weather and tornado event sections of  local NWS office pages ; and  please make sure the photos are not copyrighted before using them . If there are any doubts, or to get permission to use copyrighted  material, e-mail the webmaster at that office.  SPC  has some public-domain images and descriptions of Spencer, SD tornado damage available  here . If you want hardcopies for research projects, the best bet is to download and print public-domain images from a high-quality color printer. Even when using public-domain images, you should give proper credit to the source. Historical archives at local and college libraries might have public-domain hardcopy prints of historical tornado damage in your area.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       TORNADO SAFETY      What should I do in case of a tornado?    That depends on where you are.   This list of tornado safety tips  covers most situations.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is a tornado watch?      A  tornado  watch defines an area shaped like a parallelogram, where tornadoes and other kinds of severe  weather are possible in the next several hours.  It does not mean tornadoes are imminent -- just that you need  to be alert, and to be prepared to go to safe shelter if tornadoes do happen or a warning is issued.  This is the time to turn on local TV or radio, turn on and set the alarm switch on your weather radio, make sure you have ready access to safe shelter, and make your friends and family aware of the potential for tornadoes in the area.  The  Storm Prediction Center  issues tornado and severe thunderstorm watches;  here is an example .  For more information on tornado watches and other SPC bulletins,  go here .  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is a tornado warning?    A tornado warning means that a tornado has been spotted, or that  Doppler radar  indicates a thunderstorm circulation which can spawn a tornado. When a tornado warning is issued for your town or county, take immediate   safety  precautions.  local NWS offices  issue tornado warnings.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Do  mobile homes attract tornadoes?    Of course not.  It may seem that way, considering most tornado deaths occur in them, and that some of the most graphic reports of tornado damage come from mobile home communities.  The reason for this is that mobile homes are, in general, much easier for a tornado to damage and destroy than well-built houses and office buildings.  A brief, relatively weak tornado which may have gone undetected in the wilderness -- or  misclassified as severe straight-line thunderstorm winds while doing minor damage to sturdy houses -- can  blow a mobile home apart .  Historically, mobile home parks have been reliable  indicators , not attractors, of tornadoes.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Long ago, I was told to open windows to equal  "

May 3, 1999 Oklahoma/Kansas tornado outbreak         Tornado safety                    TOTO               Where do they come from?       Tornadoes come from the energy released in a thunderstorm. As powerful as they     are, tornadoes account for only a tiny fraction of the energy in a thunderstorm.     What makes them dangerous is that their energy is concentrated in a small     area, perhaps only a hundred yards across. Not all tornadoes are the same,     of course, and science does not yet completely understand how part of a thunderstorm's     energy sometimes gets focused into something as small as a tornado.   Where do they occur?    Whenever and wherever conditions are right, tornadoes are possible, but they   are most common in the central plains of North America, east of the Rocky Mountains   and west of the Appalachian Mountains. They occur mostly during the spring   and summer; the tornado season comes early in the south and later in the north   because spring comes later in the year as one moves northward. They usually   occur during the late afternoon and early evening. However, they have been   known to occur in every state in the United States, on any day of the year,   and at any hour. They also occur in many other parts of the world, including   Australia, Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America.    If you'd like to  plot     tornado tracks , download Severe Plot   and the associated data from the NOAA Storm Prediction Center.     What type of damage can they do?     The damage from tornadoes comes from the strong winds they   contain. It is generally believed that tornadic wind speeds can be as high   as 300 mph in the most violent tornadoes. Wind speeds that high can cause automobiles   to become airborne, rip ordinary homes to shreds, and turn broken glass and   other debris into lethal missiles. The biggest threat to living creatures (including   humans) from tornadoes is from flying debris and from being tossed about in   the wind. It used to be believed that the low pressure in a tornado contributed   to the damage by making buildings ""explode"" but this is no longer believed   to be true.    How are tornadoes detected?    Today, the development of Doppler radar has made it possible,   under certain circumstances, to detect a tornado's winds with a radar. However,   human beings remain an important part of the system to detect tornadoes, because   not all tornadoes occur in situations where the radar can ""see"" them. Ordinary   citizen volunteers make up what is called the  SKYWARN  network   of storm spotters, who work with their local communities to watch for approaching   tornadoes, so those communities can take appropriate action in the event of   a tornado. Spotter information is relayed to the National Weather Service,   which operates the national Doppler radar network and which issues warnings   to the public by radio, TV, and NOAA Weather Radio, using information obtained   from weather maps, weather radars, and local storm spotters.    Can tornadoes be predicted?     Yes, but only to a limited extent. Although the process by   which tornadoes form is not completely understood, scientific research has   revealed that tornadoes usually form under certain types of atmospheric conditions.   When forecasters see those conditions, they can predict that tornadoes are   likely to occur. However, it is not yet possible to predict in advance exactly   when and where they will develop, how strong they will be, or precisely what   path they will follow. There are some ""surprises"" every year, when tornadoes   form in situations that do not look like the right conditions in advance, but   these are becoming less frequent. Once a tornado is formed and has been detected,   warnings can be issued based on the path of the storm producing the tornado,   but even these cannot be perfectly precise about who will or will not be struck.    How fast can a tornado go?    We're not really sure what the highest wind speed might be   inside a tornado. Since strong and violent tornadoes destroy weather instruments.   we really only have measurements of the winds inside weaker tornadoes. Mobile   Doppler radars can measure wind speeds in a tornado above ground level -- and   the strongest was 318 mph measured on May 3, 1999 near Bridge Creek/Moore,   Oklahoma.    What are the people called who study tornadoes?    People who study tornadoes are just research meteorologists.   You may have heard another term - storm chaser - but that really refers to   people who chase tornadoes for a hobby. Research meteorologists do science.   They have to come up with questions they think they can answer by taking certain   measurements.    How fast do tornadoes move?    We don't have detailed statistics about this. Movement can   range from almost stationary to more than 60 mph. A typical tornado travels at around 10-20 miles per hour.    How long is a tornado usually on the ground?   Detailed statistics about the time a tornado is on the ground   are not available. This time can range from an instant to several hours. The   average is about five minutes.   Does NSSL do things like they showed in the movie ""Twister""?   The movie Twister was based upon work NSSL did in the mid-1980s   using a 55-gallon drum outfitted with various meteorological sensors. It was   called  TOTO  (TOtable Tornado Observatory). NSSL tried for several years to   put it in the path of an oncoming tornado, but had minimal success. It did   not have the sensors that fly up into the tornado, like in the movie. However,   that is not a bad idea and with all the advances being made in computer technology,   we might be able to do that someday.    Has every state had a tornado?   Yes, although some states have many more tornadoes than others.   Are there tornadoes in the Arctic Circle?    We are not aware of any tornadoes occurring in the Arctic Circle.   Tornadoes need moisture and warm air to form, which is unusual at that lattitude.   Plus tornadoes or their evidence have to be observed by someone, and the Arctic   Circle has few residents!    Do tornadoes really stay away from gullies, rivers and mountains?   A gully could actually make a tornado more intense, just as   an ice skater spins faster when he or she stands up tall and stretches their   arms up straight over their heads. Every major river east of the Rockies has   been crossed by a significant tornado, and high elevations in the Appalachians,   Rockies, and Sierra Nevada have all experienced tornadoes. A violent tornado   crossed the Continental Divide in Yellowstone National Park.    Do tornadoes always come from a wall cloud?    A wall cloud is not always present. It is possible, though,   that you cannot see a wall cloud because of your viewing angle.    What does a tornado sound like?   People who have been in a tornado say it sounds like a jet   engine or a freight train and is very loud. They said it hurt their ears but   they were more worried about what might happen to them than they were about   the pain in their ears.    Can tornadoes be stopped?    You have to consider that the tornado is part of something   bigger - the supercell thunderstorm. Unless you disrupt the supercell thunderstorm   itself, you would likely have another tornado, even if you were able to destroy   the first. The thunderstorm's energy is much greater than the tornado. No one   has tried to disrupt the tornado because the methods to do so could likely   cause even more damage than the tornado. Detonating a hydrogen bomb, for example,   to disrupt a tornado would be even more deadly and destructive than the tornado   itself. Lesser things (like huge piles of dry ice or smaller conventional weaponry)   would be too hard to deploy in the right place fast enough, and would likely not have enough impact to affect the tornado much anyway.    How much advance warning can forecasters give us before a   tornado strikes?    The current average lead-time for tornado warnings is 11 minutes. NSSL is working to increase tornado warning lead-times to 20 minutes.   What is the difference between a tornado watch and a tornado   warning?    A tornado watch defines a box-shaped area where tornadoes   and other kinds of severe weather are possible in the next several hours. It   means that you need to be alert, and be prepared to go to safe shelter if tornadoes   happen or a warning is issued. If you have a NOAA Weather Radio and have it   set up correctly it will alert you to the watch. Tune in to local TV or radio   for more information. A tornado warning means that a tornado has been spotted,   or that Doppler radar shows a thunderstorm circulation which can spawn a tornado.   When a tornado warning is issued for your area, seek safe shelter immediately.   The Storm Prediction Center issues tornado and severe thunderstorm watches.   Your local National Weather Service offices issue tornado warnings.  Can a tornado dig up the ground?    There have been reports of tornadoes blowing dirt and creating   a trench 3 feet deep, but it is very uncommon. Tornadoes have been known to strip asphalt pavement.   What is the worst tornado that you know of?    The deadliest US tornadoes [more than one?] were in 1925 on   March 18. It is called the ""Tri-state"" tornado and killed 695 people along   its 219 mile track through Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.    Do tornadoes have a positive effect on the environment?    Not that we know of yet...but the thunderstorms that produce   tornadoes release energy that builds up in the atmosphere.    How many people are killed by tornadoes each year?   On the average tornadoes kill about 60 people each year, mostly   from flying or falling debris.    What would it be like to be in the eye of a tornado?    The very center of the tornado is probably almost calm, but   may have some downward motion in it. There have not been any direct measurements   of the winds because the instruments used to measure wind speed can't survive   long enough to measure the eye.    How many tornadoes hit the US each year?   About 1000    How often do  F4/F5 tornadoes occur?     Of the 1000 tornadoes that occur each year, about 2% of them   are rated F4 or F5. That means that there are as many as 20 devastating tornadoes   each year. It is possible that meteorologists have underestimated the number   of violent tornadoes that occur each year. Tornadoes are rated only by damage   they do to man-made structures. Therefore, if a tornado doesn't hit a structure   of some kind, we cannot estimate its strength. Also, a tornado varies in strength   during its lifetime and could be its strongest while between areas of houses   or other buildings.    Could there be an F-6 tornado?    Dr. Ted Fujita, the inventor of the ""F-scale"", did plot hypothetical   winds at an ""F6"" level. But, it was untested theory and therefore he was making   educated guesses. The F-scale is based on damage to man-made structures, not   precise wind speeds. Scientists have very few measurements of tornado winds.   F5 is the most intense possible damage level - total destruction. Fujita said   that although he speculated that a tornado could be stronger than an F5, even   a structural engineer could not distinguish F6 damage from F5. F5 is the highest   scientifically accepted rating for tornadoes. The highest recorded windspeed   in a tornado was 318 mph, still within the bounds of the F5 description. These   precise wind speed numbers are actually educated guesses and have never been   scientifically verified. As we obtain more measurements on tornadoes, we may   actually learn that the wind estimates on the Fujita scale are wrong! Damage   can vary from place to place or even building to building based on construction,   even if the wind speeds were the same.   What effect do El Niño/La Niña have on tornadoes?     There have only been two strong La Niña events. Although   scientists have looked for a correlation between La Niña and tornadoes,   there just isn't enough data to make any conclusions.   I have a theory about tornadoes, who do I talk to?    We receive   literally hundreds of ideas for observing, controlling, or stopping destructive   storms. Our scientists are likely to look at ideas that are investigated by   a researcher who publishes the results in a peer-reviewed journal. In this   way they can review, and if necessary, replicate the results, which then will suggest the next step to move the science forward.    How do I become a storm spotter?    Visit  www.skywarn.org   .   SKYWARN is a cooperative effort between the National Weather Service and communities   to organize spotters. On that site there is a link to local SKYWARN groups.   If your area is not listed, contact your local National Weather Service Office.    I would like to volunteer to help NSSL during a tornado intercept field project.    Unfortunately, government regulations   make it impossible to accept offers from the public to do volunteer field work   for any tornado intercept programs. Legal liability questions prevent NSSL   from accepting volunteers, even at their own risk.    I want to chase tornadoes on my vacation – what time of year and what locations are best?    Check   our Severe Weather Climatology page at  www.nssl.noaa.gov/hazard/     Which is stronger, a hurricane or tornado?    The winds from a strong tornado (F4 or F5 - 207 mph   or higher) are significantly stronger than the highest category of hurricane   (Saffir-Simpson Scale Category 4 or 5 - 131 mph and higher). However, hurricanes   tend to cause much more destruction than tornadoes because they cover a much   larger area, last longer, and have a variety of destructive forces (the eyewall,   storm surge, flooding, and sustained strong winds). Tornadoes, in contrast,   tend to be a mile or smaller in diameter, last for minutes and primarily cause   damage from their extreme winds.    Where is the most common birthplace for a violent tornado?    According to research done by Dr. Harold Brooks here at NSSL,   the most common birthplace for a violent tornado (F4 or greater) is in south-central   Oklahoma.    How is the strength of a tornado determined?    The most common   and practical way to determine the strength of a tornado is to look at the   damage it caused. From the damage, we can estimate wind speeds. Professor Theodore   Fujita developed a scale to help us evaluate damage and classify tornadoes.   In summary, the Fujita Scale ranges from F0-F5. F0 tornadoes have winds of   40-72 mph and can break branches off of trees and damage signs. F5 tornadoes   have winds from 261-318 mph, which can lift houses off foundations, and make   automobiles as dangerous as a missile flying through the air. A more complete   listing of the scale can be found at --  www.tornadoproject.com   ,   and click on ""The Fujita Scale"" either in the menu to the left or at the bottom.    An ""Enhanced   Fujita Scale"" will be implemented by the National Weather Service by   February, 2007. In a nutshell, the enhanced F scale was developed to rate tornadoes   in a more consistent and accurate manner. It will still rate tornado categories   from F0 to F5, but the ranges of wind speed in each category are now more accurate.   It takes into account more variables than the original scale did when assigning   a wind speed rating to a tornado, incorporating 28 damage indicators such as   building type, structures, and trees. For each damage indicator, there are   8 degrees of damage ranging from the beginning of visible damage to complete   destruction of the damage indicator. The original F scale did not take these details into account. The original F Scale historical data base will not change.   An F5 tornado rated years ago is still an F5, but the wind speed associated   with the tornado may have been somewhat less than previously estimated. A correlation   between the original F Scale and the EF Scale has been developed. This makes   it possible to express ratings in terms of one scale to the other, preserving the historical database.Go to:  www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/ef-scale.html     Do tornadoes target mobile home parks?    While it may appear tornadoes target mobile   home parks, they actually do not. An F1 tornado might do significant damage   to a mobile home, and cause minor damage to a site built home -- looking like   the tornado ""skipped"" the house. Mobile homes are, in general, much   easier for a tornado to damage and destroy than well-built houses and office   buildings. A mobile home, or manufactured home, by definition, is built at   a factory and taken to the place they will occupy--so they are much more affordable   than a house built on-site. Also, they are often built with lighter-weight materials, which do not hold up well in tornadic winds.    Straight-line winds can also destroy a mobile home as easily   as a tornado, especially one that is not anchored. Any wind gust that is sustained for 3 seconds over 50mph can cause damage to mobile homes.    These websites may   be of interest to you:      http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/mhdeadly.htm       http://www.ametsoc.org/POLICY/statement_2004_mobilehomes.html        http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/zine/archives/1-20/29/guest.html     Some states   are beginning to require storm shelters for their residents. The statistics   definitely support this --7% of our population lives in mobile homes, and almost   half of tornado fatalities in the U.S. occur in mobile homes. The problem of   warning and sheltering mobile home residents has become the biggest obstacle   to continuing to reduce death tolls from tornadoes.    Do wider tornadoes cause more damage?    There is a statistical trend toward wide tornadoes having   higher F-scale damage. This can be because of more strength or because of greater   opportunity for targets to damage - or a combination of both. However, the   size or shape of any particular tornado does not say anything conclusive about   its strength. Some small tornadoes can still do very violent damage of F4 or   F5. And, some very large tornadoes over a quarter-mile wide have produced only   weak damage.   What is the difference between a tornado and a cyclone?    A tornado   is a small-scale cyclonic circulation, and in the past, has been referred to as a cyclone.    The term cyclone was used to describe anything that rotated   counterclockwise, so often tornado (a small-scale cyclonic circulation) and   cyclone were interchangeable. However, modern meteorology now restricts the   use of the term to the larger-scale circulations -- usually also accompanied   by low pressure and bad weather. But, people still use it both ways.    Are there electromagnetic or magnetohydrodynamic explanations for the development of tornadoes?    As far as scientists understand,   tornadoes are formed and sustained by a purely thermodynamic process. As a   result, their research efforts are towards that end. They have spent a lot   of time modeling the formation of a tornado and measuring many parameters in   and around a tornado when it is forming and going through its life cycle. They   have not seen any evidence to support magnetism or electricity playing a role.   Can my TV signal detect tornadoes?    You may have read about   a technique called ""the   Weller Method"" of tornado detection. The idea was to be able to use your   TV as a lightning detector to detect the radio waves emitted by a lightning   flash, with the assumption that tornadic thunderstorms were very active lightning   producers. But, not all tornadic storms produce large amounts of lightning.   And, TV's are all different and have different sensitivities, and some are   even made to filter out lightning signals. Plus, if you are connected to cable,   it won't work. The method was found to be completely unreliable and it has mostly been abandoned.    Do tornadoes occur when it is cold?    There is no   particular temperature at which tornadoes form. It is more about what the surface   temperature is in relation to the temperature higher up in the atmosphere.   Even if it is cold near the surface, as long as it is colder higher up, the   winds are right to set up low-level wind shear, along with other necessary ingredients, a tornado is possible.    What direction do tornadoes spin?    Most tornadoes (but not all) in the Northern Hemisphere spin counterclockwise.    Do rocks, hills, or trees increase or decrease the wind speeds in a tornado?    Unfortunately,   there is no clear answer. Both observations (of real tornadoes), computer simulations,   and laboratory studies (in tornado vortex chambers) have shown that the ""surface   roughness"", i.e., the measure of how disrupted the wind near the ground   is by objects such as dirt, rocks, hills, trees, and even houses, can either   increase or decrease the wind speeds in a tornado. How can trees increase the   wind speeds? Well, the strongest winds in a tornado occur when air from outside   the tornado can flow closest to the center of the vortex. The conservation   of angular momentum, e.g., the rotation in the air, requires that as the air   flows toward the center of the tornado (as it spirals in) its rotation must   increase. Depending on the configuration of the airflow outside of the tornado,   sometimes there is not ENOUGH ""inflow"" toward the center, and so   blobs of air outside the tornado do not get very close to the center of rotation   before they are lifted upward off the ground. In this case, INCREASING the   surface roughness helps get these blobs of air closer to the center of the   tornado, where they rotate even faster than before. So occasionally we see   in tornado videos the vortex increasing in intensity when it travels from one   type of ground surface (say a field) into a grove of trees or a housing subdivision.   It does not always happen, but often enough that we are aware of it. This is   a case where ""friction"", which people normally think of slowing things down, actually speeds them up!    Can you recommend a good storm shelter manufacturer?   We do not endorse any particular company or type of storm shelter.   Consider checking out the Federal Emergency Management Agency website at  fema.gov   . They work with communities on tornado preparedness.   How can I keep my kids safe during a tornado?    Educate yourself and your kids about tornado safety.   Being informed and having a plan of action is the best way to keep you and   your family safe. Work out together where you will go in case a tornado is   approaching and why. Have the kids put together a tornado kit, with games,   books, cars, and even snacks to keep them busy while they are taking shelter – make   them a part of the process. Use a NOAA Weather Radio and show the kids how   it can alert your family to danger. NSSL developed  coloring   books for kids   a few years ago – it may be helpful to print them   out and review them with your kids.    Most tornado injuries are caused   by flying debris, so the best thing for you to do is probably lay on top of   your child and cover both of you with a mattress or a couch cushion. Strap   infants in their car seat (in the house of course), and put bicycle helmets   on the other children to protect their heads. Make sure everyone had sturdy   shoes (not sandals) and jeans. See our  severe   weather safety page .    Check out   books from the library about tornadoes. It seems the more we understand something, the less we fear it.    Plus, there are much more dangerous weather events than   tornadoes. Flash floods are the number one weather-related killer in the U.S.,   followed by lightning. There are an average of 1000 tornadoes a year, killing about 40-50 people each year.    Is it safe to take shelter under an overpass?   Absolutely not! Stopping under a bridge to take shelter from a tornado is a very dangerous idea, for several reasons:         Deadly flying debris     can still be blasted into the spaces between bridge and grade -- and severely     injure any people taking shelter there.      Even when strongly gripping the girders (if     they exist), people may be blown loose, out from under the bridge and into     the open -- possibly well up into the tornado itself. Chances for survival     are not good if that happens.     The bridge itself may fail, peeling apart     and creating large flying objects, or even collapsing down onto people underneath.     The structural integrity of many bridges in tornado winds is unknown -- even     for those that may look sturdy.      Whether or not the tornado hits, parking     on traffic lanes is illegal and dangerous to yourself and others. It creates     a potentially deadly hazard for others, who may plow into your vehicle at     full highway speeds in the rain, hail, and/or dust. Also, it can trap people     in the storm's path against their will, or block emergency vehicles from     saving lives.      What should I do if there is a tornado warning while I am at     work at a hospital or nursing home?    Your medical director or nursing home     administrator should have a disaster plan for you to review. Most accredited     medical facilities are required to have a disaster plan on file, including     procedures during tornadoes, and to review that plan annually with the staff.       Are crawl spaces safe tornado shelters?    Crawl spaces are generally not considered     safe shelter from tornadoes because it is hard to know how well the house     is attached to the foundation. If a tornado moved the house a foot or two,     and this happens a lot, the entire house could drop on you. Plus, lots of     unwelcome critters live in crawl spaces and it doesn't sound very safe to     spend time with spiders and snakes!    Where is tornado alley?    ""Tornado Alley"" is a just a nickname made up by the media for an area of relatively     high tornado occurrence - it is not a clearly defined area. Is tornado alley     the area with the most violent tornadoes, or is it the area with the most     tornado related deaths, or the highest frequency or tornadoes? It depends     on what kind of information you want!

A SEVERE WEATHER PRIMER:     Questions and Answers about TORNADOES      home   »  education   »  severe weather primer  » tornado         TORNADO FAQs           Where do tornadoes come from?        How fast can a tornado go?        What are the people called who study tornadoes?        How fast do tornadoes move?       How long is a tornado usually on the ground?        Does NSSL do things like they showed in the movie ""Twister""?       What direction do tornadoes spin?         Tornadoes come from the energy released in a thunderstorm. As powerful as they are, tornadoes account for only a tiny fraction of the energy in a thunderstorm. What makes them dangerous is that their energy is concentrated in a small area, perhaps only a hundred yards across. Not all tornadoes are the same, of course, and science does not yet completely understand how part of a thunderstorm's energy sometimes gets focused into something as small as a tornado.      We're not really sure what the highest wind speed might be inside a tornado. Since strong and violent tornadoes destroy weather instruments, we really only have measurements of the winds inside weaker tornadoes. Mobile Doppler radars can measure wind speeds in a tornado above ground level -- and the strongest was 318 mph measured on May 3, 1999 near Bridge Creek/Moore, Oklahoma.     People who study tornadoes are just research meteorologists. You may have heard another term - storm chaser - but that really refers to people who chase tornadoes for a hobby. Research meteorologists do science. They have to come up with questions they think they can answer by taking certain measurements.     We don't have detailed statistics about this. Movement can range from almost stationary to more than 60 mph. A typical tornado travels at around 10-20 miles per hour.     Detailed statistics about the time a tornado is on the ground are not available. This time can range from an instant to several hours. The average is about five minutes.     The movie Twister was based upon work NSSL did in the mid-1980s using a 55-gallon drum outfitted with various meteorological sensors. It was called TOTO (TOtable Tornado Observatory). NSSL tried for several years to put it in the path of an oncoming tornado, but had minimal success. It did not have the sensors that fly up into the tornado, like in the movie. However, that is not a bad idea and with all the advances being made in computer technology, we might be able to do that someday.

A tornado is a narrow, violently rotating column of air that extends from   the base of a thunderstorm to the ground. Because wind is invisible, you can't   always see a tornado. A visible sign of the tornado,   a  condensation funnel  made up of water droplets, sometimes forms and may or   may not touch the ground during the tornado lifecycle. Dust and debris in the   rotating column also make a tornado visible and confirm its presence.    What is known?    Tornadoes are the most violent of all atmospheric storms.    There are two types of tornadoes: those that come from a supercell thunderstorm,   and those that do not.   Tornadoes that form from a  supercell  thunderstorm are     the most common, and often the most dangerous. A supercell is a long-lived     (greater than 1 hour) and highly organized storm feeding off an  updraft  (a     rising current of air) that is tilted and rotating. This rotating updraft     - as large as 10 miles in diameter and up to 50,000 feet tall - can be present     as much as 20 to 60 minutes before a tornado forms. Scientists call this     rotation a  mesocyclone  when     it is detected by Doppler radar. The tornado is a very small extension of     this larger rotation. Most large and violent tornadoes come from supercells.              larger     image    Non-supercell tornadoes are circulations that form without a rotating updraft.   One non-supercell tornado is the  gustnado ,   a whirl of dust or debris at or near the ground with no condensation funnel,   which forms along the gust front of a storm. Another non-supercell tornado   is a  landspout .   A landspout is a tornado with a narrow, rope-like condensation funnel that   forms when the thunderstorm cloud is still growing and there is no rotating   updraft - the spinning motion originates near the ground. Waterspouts are similar   to landspouts, except   they occur over water. Damage from these types of tornadoes tends to be F2   or less.    » More About     VISUALIZING ROTATION      How do tornadoes form?         Scientists have learned a lot about tornadogenesis from theoretical         studies, field projects and physical models – but tornadogenesis – the       way tornadoes form – has vexed researchers for decades.        SUPERCELL TORNADOGENESIS          A rotating updraft is a key         to the development of a supercell, and eventually a tornado. There are         many ideas about how this rotation begins. One way a column of air can         begin to rotate is from wind  shear  – when         winds at two different levels above the ground blow at different speeds         or in different directions.          An example of wind shear that can eventually         create a tornado is when winds at ground level, often slowed down by         friction with the earth's surface, come from the southwest at 5 mph.         But higher up, at 5000 feet above the same location, the winds are blowing         from the southeast at 25 mph! An invisible ""tube"" of air begins to rotate         horizontally. Rising air within the thunderstorm tilts the rotating air         from horizontal to vertical – now the area of rotation extends through         much of the storm.          Once the updraft is rotating and being fed by warm, moist         air flowing in at ground level, a tornado can form. There are many ideas       about this too.          » More About SUPERCELL TORNADOGENESIS           We still have many questions. Scientists know from field studies that         perhaps as few as 20 percent of all supercell thunderstorms actually         produce tornadoes. Why does one supercell thunderstorm produce a tornado         and another nearby storm does not? What are some of the causes of winds         moving at different speeds or directions that create the rotation? What         are other circulation sources for tornadoes? What is the role of  downdrafts  (a sinking current of air) and the distribution of temperature and moisture         (both horizontally and vertically) in tornadogenesis? Scientists hope         to learn more about the processes that create wind shear and rotation,         tilt it vertically, and concentrate the rotation into a tornado when       they participate in a large field experiment in 2007.          And, since not all tornadoes come from supercells, what about tornadogenesis       in non-supercell thunderstorms?          NON-SUPERCELL TORNADOGENESIS          A non-supercell tornado         does not form from organized storm-scale rotation. These tornadoes form         from a vertically spinning parcel of air already occurring near the ground,         about 1-10 km in diameter, that is caused by wind shear from a warm,         cold, or sea breeze front, or a  dryline . When an updraft moves over the         spinning, and stretches it, a tornado can form. Eastern Colorado experiences         non-supercell tornadoes when cool air rushes down off the Rocky Mountains         and collides with the hot dry air of the plains. Since these types         of tornadoes happen mostly over scarcely populated land, scientists are       not sure how strong they are, but they tend to be small. Waterspouts       and gustnadoes are formed in this way too.                    HOW DOES NSSL CONTRIBUTE?            Tornadogenesis      NSSL scientists are working to understand the origins of tornadoes in thunderstorms       through the use of theory. The research focuses on understanding how the       local environment around the storm and internal processes within the storm       produce tornadoes. New insight into these processes can then be incorporated       into NSSL's warning decision technologies to help improve warnings for       tornadoes and severe storms.            Field Observations      NSSL scientists go into the field to look for specific processes in storms,       like observing how tornadoes form, and to test theories and hypotheses.            Storm modeling      Analysis of detailed data sets collected during storm intercept projects       provides invaluable knowledge of storm dynamics. This information helps       provide a coherent picture of storm structure that can be used in modeling       tornadoes and tornado features. The COMMAS model, co-developed by an NSSL       researcher can simulate a three-dimensional supercell thunderstorm.                next --  TORNADO     CLIMATOLOGY            11/15/06        "

Nature's Most Violent Storms   Adapted from:   A PREPAREDNESS GUIDE Including Safety Information   for Schools U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration   National Weather Service September 1992 (NOAA, FEMA, The American Red Cross);    PDF version    Tornado!       Greg Stumpf     Although tornadoes occur in many parts of the world, these destructive forces   of nature are found most frequently in the United States east of the Rocky   Mountains during the spring and summer months. In an average year, 800 tornadoes   are reported nationwide, resulting in 80 deaths and over 1,500 injuries. A   tornado is defined as a violently rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm   to the ground. The most violent tornadoes are capable of tremendous destruction   with wind speeds of 250 mph or more. Damage paths can be in excess of one mile   wide and 50 miles long. Once a tornado in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, carried a motel sign 30 miles and dropped it in Arkansas!     What causes tornadoes?   Thunderstorms develop in warm, moist air in advance of eastward-moving cold   fronts. These thunderstorms often produce large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes.   Tornadoes in the winter and early spring are often associated with strong,   frontal systems that form in the Central States and move east. Occasionally,   large outbreaks of tornadoes occur with this type of weather pattern. Several states may be affected by numerous severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.   During the spring in the Central Plains, thunderstorms frequently develop   along a ""dryline,"" which separates very warm, moist air to   the east from hot, dry air to the west. Tornado-producing thunderstorms may form as the dryline moves east during the afternoon hours.   Along the front range of the Rocky Mountains, in the Texas panhandle, and   in the southern High Plains, thunderstorms frequently form as air near the   ground flows ""upslope"" toward higher terrain. If other favorable conditions exist, these thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.   Tornadoes occasionally accompany tropical storms and hurricanes that move   over land. Tornadoes are most common to the right and ahead of the path of the storm center as it comes onshore.          Colorado Tornado (David Blanchard)           Dr. Joseph Golden (NOAA)      Tornado Variations       Some tornadoes may form during the early stages of rapidly developing thunderstorms.     This type of tornado is most common along the front range of the Rocky Mountains,   the Plains, and the Western States.     Tornadoes may appear nearly transparent until dust and debris are picked   up.     Occasionally, two or more tornadoes may occur at the same time.     Waterspout       Waterspouts are weak tornadoes that form over warm water.      Waterspouts are most common along the Gulf Coast and southeastern states.     In the western United States, they occur with cold late fall or late winter   storms, during a time when you least expect tornado development.     Waterspouts occasionally move inland becoming tornadoes causing damage   and injuries.     How Do Tornadoes Form?                     Before thunderstorms develop, a change in wind direction and an increase         in wind speed with increasing height creates an invisible, horizontal         spinning effect in the lower atmosphere.                    Rising air within the thunderstorm updraft         tilts the rotating air from horizontal to vertical.                    An area of rotation, 2-6 miles wide, now extends through much of the         storm. Most strong and violent tornadoes form within this area of strong     rotation.                         Woodward OK (Ron Przybylinski)          A lower cloud base in the center of the photograph identifies an area         of rotation known as a rotating wall cloud. This area is often nearly rain-free.         Note rain in the background.                  Woodward OK (Ron Przybylinski)         Moments later a strong tornado develops in this area. Softball-size         hail and damaging ""straight-line"" winds also occurred with         this storm.                       Tornadoes Take Many Shapes and Sizes             Weak Tornadoes                   69% of all tornadoes           Less than 5% of tornado deaths           Lifetime 1-10+ minutes           Winds less than 110 mph                       Strong Tornadoes                   29% of all tornadoes           Nearly 30% of all tornado deaths           May last 20 minutes or longer           Winds 110-205 mph                        Violent Tornadoes                   Only 2% of all tornadoes            70% of all tornado deaths           Lifetime can exceed 1 hour           Lifetime can exceed 1 hour                           Tornado Myths:   MYTH:  Areas near rivers, lakes, and mountains are safe from tornadoes.      FACT:   No place is safe from tornadoes. In the late 1980's, a tornado swept through   Yellowstone National Park leaving a path of destruction up and down a 10,000   ft. mountain.   MYTH : The low pressure with a tornado causes buildings to ""explode""   as the tornado passes overhead.     FACT:  Violent winds and debris slamming into buildings cause most structural damage.   MYTH:  Windows should be opened before a tornado approaches   to equalize pressure and minimize damage.     FACT:  Opening windows allows damaging winds   to enter the structure. Leave the windows alone; instead, immediately go to a safe place.

The National Weather Service is strategically locating Doppler radars   across the country which can detect air movement toward or away from the radar.   Early detection of increasing rotation aloft within a thunderstorm can allow life-saving warnings to be issued before the tornado forms.        Doppler Radial Velocity             Jim Ladue     Frequency of Tornadoes   Tornadoes can occur at any time of the year.       In the southern states, peak tornado occurrence is in March through May,   while peak months in the northern states are during the summer.     Note, in some states, a secondary tornado maximum occurs in the fall.     Tornadoes are most likely to occur between 3 and 9 p.m. but have been known   to occur at all hours of the day or night.     The average tornado moves from southwest to northeast, but tornadoes have     been known to move in any direction. The average forward speed is 30 mph   but may vary from nearly stationary to 70 mph.     The total number of tornadoes is probably higher than indicated in the   western states. Sparce population reduces the number reported.

When conditions are favorable for severe weather to develop, a severe thunderstorm or tornado  WATCH  is issued   Weather Service personnel use information from weather radar, spotters,   and other sources to issue severe thunderstorm and tornado  WARNINGS  for areas where severe weather is imminent.   Severe thunderstorm warnings are passed to local radio and television stations   and are broadcast over local NOAA Weather Radio stations serving the warned   areas. These warnings are also relayed to local emergency management and public safety officials who can activate local warning systems to alert communities.     NOAA WEATHER RADIO IS THE BEST MEANS TO RECEIVE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL   WEATHER SERVICE   The National Weather Service continuously broadcasts updated weather warnings   and forecasts that can be received by NOAA Weather Radios   sold in many stores. The average range is 40 miles, depending on topography.   Your National Weather Service recommends purchasing a radio that has both a   battery backup and a tone-alert feature which automatically alerts you when a watch or warning is issued.   What To Listen For...       TORNADO WATCH:  Tornadoes are possible in your area. Remain alert   for approaching storms.     TORNADO WARNING:  A tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather     radar. If a tornado warning is issued for your area and the sky becomes threatening,   move to your pre-designated place of safety.     SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH:  Severe thunderstorms are possible   in your area.     SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING:  Severe thunderstorms are occurring.       Remember, tornadoes occasionally develop in areas in which a severe thunderstorm   watch or warning is in effect. Remain alert to signs of an approaching tornado and seek shelter if threatening conditions exist.   Environmental Clues   Look out for:       Dark, often greenish sky     Wall cloud     Large hail     Loud roar; similar to a freight train       Caution:                     Some tornadoes appear as a visible funnel extending         only partially to the ground. Look for signs of debris below the visible         funnel.                        Alma, NE (Gene Rhoden)                  Some tornadoes are clearly visible while others are         obscured by rain or nearby low-hanging clouds.

Tornado Safety   What YOU Can Do   Before the Storm:       Develop a plan for you and your family for     home, work, school and when   outdoors.     Have frequent drills.     Know the county/parish in which you live, and keep a highway map nearby   to follow storm movement from weather bulletins.     Have a  NOAA Weather     Radio  with a warning alarm tone and battery back-up to receive   warnings.      Listen to radio and television for information.     If planning a trip outdoors, listen to the latest forecasts and take necessary   action if threatening weather is possible.         Top: James Campbell; Bottom: Gene Rhoden   If a Warning is issued or if threatening weather approaches:       In a home or building, move to a pre-designated shelter, such as a basement.     If an underground shelter is not available, move to an interior room or   hallway on the lowest floor and get under a sturdy piece of furniture.     Stay away from windows.     Get out of automobiles.     Do not try to outrun a tornado in your car; instead, leave it immediately.     Mobile homes, even if tied down, offer little protection from tornadoes   and should be abandoned.       Occasionally, tornadoes develop so rapidly that advance warning is not possible. Remain alert for signs of an approaching tornado. Flying debris   from tornadoes causes most deaths and injuries.   It's Up To YOU!   Each year, many people are killed or seriously injured by tornadoes despite   advance warning. Some did not hear the warning while others received the warning   but did not believe a tornado would actually affect them. The preparedness   information in this brochure, combined with timely severe weather watches and   warnings, could save your life in the event a tornado threatens your area.   After you have received the warning or observed threatening skies, YOU must   make the decision to seek shelter before the storm arrives.  It could be the most important decision you will ever make.     Who's Most At Risk?       People in automobiles     The elderly, very young, and the physically or mentally impaired     People in mobile homes     People who may not understand the warning due to a language barrier     Tornado Safety in Schools   EVERY School Should Have A Plan!         Develop a severe weather action plan and have frequent drills,     Each school should be inspected and tornado shelter areas designated by     a registered engineer or architect. Basements offer the best protection.     Schools without basements should use interior rooms and hallways on the lowest   floor and away from windows.     Those responsible for activating the plan should monitor weather information   from NOAA Weather Radio and local radio/television.     If the school's alarm system relies on electricity, have a compressed air   horn or megaphone to activate the alarm in case of power failure.     Make special provisions for disabled students and those in portable classrooms.     Make sure someone knows how to turn off electricity and gas in the event   the school is damaged.     Keep children at school beyond regular hours if threatening weather is     expected. Children are safer at school than in a bus or car. Students should   not be sent home early if severe weather is approaching.     Lunches or assemblies in large rooms should be delayed if severe weather     is anticipated. Gymnasiums, cafeterias, and auditoriums offer no protection   from tornado-strength winds.     Move students quickly into interior rooms or hallways on the lowest floor.   Have them assume the tornado protection position (shown at right).         Hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions should develop a similar plan         Paul Bowen   Your National Weather Service, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and American   Red Cross educate community officials and the public concerning the dangers   posed by tornadoes. YOU can prepare for the possibility of a tornado by learning   the safest places to seek shelter when at home, work, school, or outdoors.   You should also understand basic weather terms and danger signs related to   tornadoes. Your chances of staying safe during a tornado are greater if you   have a plan for you and your family, and practice the plan frequently.   FAMILY DISASTER PLAN     Families should be prepared for all hazards that affect their area. NOAA's   National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the American Red Cross urge each family to develop a family disaster plan.   Where will your family be when disaster strikes? They could be anywhere -   at work, at school, or in the car. How will you find each other? Will you know   if your children are safe? Disasters may force you to evacuate your neighborhood   or confine you to your home. What would you do if basic services - water, gas, electricity or telephones - were cut off?   Follow these basic steps to develop a family disaster plan...       I. Gather information about hazards.   Contact your local National     Weather Service office, emergency management or civil defense office, and     American Red Cross chapter. Find out what type of disasters could occur and     how you should respond. Learn your community's warning signals and evacuation   plans.     II. Meet with your family to create a plan.        Discuss the information     you have gathered. Pick two places to meet: a spot outside your home for     an emergency, such as fire, and a place away from your neighborhood in case     you can't return home. Choose an out-of-state friend as your ""family     check-in contact"" for everyone to call if the family gets separated.   Discuss what you would do if advised to evacuate.     III. Implement your plan      (1) Post emergency telephone numbers by phones;   (2) Install safety features in your house, such as smoke detectors and fire   extinguishers; (3) Inspect your home for potential hazards (such as items that   can move, fall, break, or catch fire) and correct them; (4) Have your family   learn basic safety measures, such as CPR and first aid; how to use a fire extinguisher;     and how and when to turn off water, gas, and electricity in your home; (5)   Teach children how and when to call 911 or your local Emergency Medical Services   number; (6) Keep enough supplies in your home to meet your     needs for at least three days. Assemble a disaster supplies kit with     items you may need in case of an evacuation. Store these supplies in     sturdy, easy-to-carry containers, such as backpacks or duffle bags. Keep     important family documents in a waterproof container. Keep a smaller   disaster supplies kit in the trunk of your car.               A DISASTER SUPPLIES     KIT SHOULD INCLUDE:      A 3-day supply of water (one gallon per person per day)     and food that won't spoil  one change of clothing and footwear per person     one blanket or sleeping bag per person     a first-aid kit, including prescription medicines     emergency tools, including a battery-powered NOAA Weather Radio and a     portable radio, flashlight, and plenty of extra batteries     an extra set of car keys and a credit card or cash     special items for infant, elderly, or disabled family members.            IV. Practice and maintain       your plan .      Ask questions to make sure your family remembers meeting places, phone numbers,     and safety rules. Conduct drills. Test your smoke detectors monthly and change     the batteries at least once a year. Test and recharge your fire extinguisher(s)     according to manufacturer's instructions. Replace stored water and food every   six months.     LOCAL SPONSORSHIP:  NOAA/PA 92052 ARC 5002     Return to  nssl home   »  education   »  severe   weather safety       "

In an average year, 800           tornadoes are reported across the United States, resulting in           80 deaths and over 1,500 injuries. A tornado is as a violently           rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground.           The most violent tornadoes are capable of tremendous destruction           with wind speeds of 250 mph or more. Damage paths can be in excess           of one mile wide and 50 miles long.             Tornadoes           come in all shapes and sizes and can occur anywhere in the U.S           at any time of the year. In the southern states, peak tornado           season is March through May, while peak months in the northern           states are during the summer.

Every one of the  United States has experienced at least one documented tornado, and many states are hit multiple times each year by a twister.  A tornado  may occur at any time of day, and on any day of the year.  It may hit in the middle of the night, or in the middle of winter.  However,  the most common timing for a tornado is in the late afternoon of warmer months.    Unfortunately, for most communities outside of Tornado Alley (in the central and Midwest US), a tornado is such a remote possibility,  that cities or towns may not have warning systems in place, and few people are prepared when a tornado does strike.  However, knowing  what to do in case of a tornado warning can save your life and the lives of your family.       [ Top of Page  |  Overview  |   Myths and Facts |  Safety: [     Preparation  |  Watches  |     Warnings  |  Outdoors  |     Afterwards  ]        Tornado Myths and Facts    ""When confronted by a tornado warning, you should open all the windows in your house to equalize the  pressure.""   MYTH:   This just wastes valuable time.  Don't worry about equalizing the pressure, the roof ripping off and the pickup  truck smashing through the front wall will equalize the pressure for you.    ""I live in a big city, a tornado wouldn't hit a big city.""   MYTH:  Tornadoes have hit several large cities,  including Dallas, Oklahoma City, Wichita Falls, St. Louis, Miami, and Salt Lake City.  In fact, an urban tornado will have a lot more  debris to toss around than a rural twister.      A tornado approaches downtown Dallas, TX on 02 April, 1957    Click to visit NOAA library page   The path of the May 3, 1999 F5 tornado that tore through downtown Oklahoma City   From KFOR-TV, Oklahoma       ""Tornadoes don't happen in the mountains.""    MYTH:  Tornadoes do occur in the mountains. Damage from an F3 tornado  was documented above 10,000 feet, and a hiker in the mountains of Utah photographed a weak tornado in the mountains.     ""Tornadoes may occur in the middle of the night and even during the winter.""   FACT:   Although the likelihood is  lower at night and during colder months, tornadoes have caused death and destruction during these times of day and year.  Violent tornadoes,  while very unlikely during the winter months, do occasionally occur at night.  When severe weather is forecast, ensure your  NOAA weather radio is on and working properly before you go to bed.    ""My city doesn't get tornadoes because it is protected by a river.""    MYTH:  Many tornadoes have crossed rivers and  even gone on to cause widespread damage to riverside cities.  For example, the  Nachez, Mississippi tornado of 1840   tracked directly down the Mississippi River, killing hundreds, mostly on the water.  Others have crossed large rivers without losing speed (they  momentarily became water spouts) and devastated cities that folklore had thought immune to tornadoes. An example was the   Waco, TX tornado of 1953  that crossed the Brazos River, or the   Great St. Louis Cyclone of 1896  that jumped the Mississippi River.    ""Tornadoes have picked people and items up, carried them some distance and then set them down without injury or damage.""   FACT:  People and animals have been transported up to a quarter mile or more without serious injury.  Fragile items, such as sets of fine china, or glass-ware have  been blown from houses and recovered, miles away, without any damage.  However, given the quantity of airborne debris, these occurrences are the exception,  rather than the norm.    ""Hiding under a freeway overpass will protect me from a tornado.""    MYTH:  While the concrete and re-bar in the bridge may offer  some protection against flying debris, the overpass also acts as a wind tunnel and may actually serve to collect debris.  When you abandon your  vehicle at the overpass and climb up the sides, you are doing two things that are hazardous.  First, you are blocking the roadway with your vehicle.   When the tornado turns all the parked vehicles into a mangled, twisted ball and wedges them under the overpass, how will emergency vehicles get through?   Second, the winds in a tornado tend to be faster with height.  By climbing up off the ground, you place yourself in even greater danger from the tornado  and flying debris.  When coupled with the accelerated winds due to the wind tunnel (Venturi Effect), these winds can easily exceed 300 mph.   Unfortunately, at least three people hiding under underpasses during tornadoes have already been killed, and dozens have been injured by flying debris.  If you realize you won't be able to outrun an approaching tornado, you are much safer to abandon your vehicle, and take shelter in a road-side ditch  or other low spot (see  Tornado Safety ).  For more information on the use of highway overpasses for shelter, please see this   NWS discussion on highway overpasses .  Note:  If a highway overpass is your only  shelter option, only consider it if the overpass has sturdy roadway supports, next to which (at ground level) you can take shelter.   Avoid the smooth concrete, support-less spans at all costs.    ""I can outrun a tornado, especially in a vehicle.""   MYTH:  Tornadoes can move at up to 70 mph or more and shift directions  erratically and without warning.  It is unwise to try to outrace a tornado.  It is better to abandon your vehicle and seek shelter immediately.    ""While there is no such thing as a category 6 hurricane (the  Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale   only goes to category 5), there can be an F6 tornado.""   FACT:   The  Fujita Tornado Damage Intensity Scale   actually goes up to F12!  The F12 level only begins at wind speeds exceeding Mach 1.0 (or around 738 mph at -3°C), so the  probability of a tornado having winds of this speed is infinitesimally small.  Could a tornado be an F6?  Yes, however, the Fujita  scale is based on wind speeds that are estimated from the damage the tornado produced (because no one has been able to stick an anemometer into  a tornado to measure the actual wind speeds).  Since the winds of an F5 tornado (up to 319 mph) are sufficient to completely destroy  just about everything in its path, an F6 really wouldn't do much more damage than that, and therefore could not be definitively labeled  as an F6.  When accurate measurements of wind speed inside an extreme tornado are eventually obtained, it is not impossible that they may exceed 319 mph.    ""Tornadoes are more likely to hit a mobile home park.""    MYTH:  Not so.  It just seems that way for two reasons.   First, mobile home parks are a ubiquitous part of our landscape.  There are tens of thousands of mobile homes in tornado alley, so there is a pretty  good likelihood that some of them will be in the path of a tornado.  Unfortunately, the second factor is that mobile homes offer little  to no protection against even the weakest tornadoes, so when a tornado does strike a mobile home park, the damage is more likely to be significant.   Winds that would only lift some shingles on a frame house can easily flip a mobile home.    ""Strong, sturdy brick or stone buildings will protect me from a tornado.""   MYTH:  While such buildings will provide more  protection in a tornado than a mobile home or timber frame structure, the winds of a tornado can easily launch a 2x4 through a brick wall, and can  cause even the sturdiest of buildings to experience roof or wall failure.      Remnants of a brick building after a tornado hit St. Louis, MO on 27 May, 1896   Click to visit NOAA Library Page      ""To keep from being sucked into the tornado, can tie myself to a well pipe, just like they did in the  movie ""Twister"".""   MYTH:    While it is unlikely that a tornado will dislodge a deeply buried pipe, the rope you tie around  yourself is more likely to act as a combination tetherball and cheese slicer.  Lighter winds will likely cause you to be whipped around  at the end of the rope, banging against anything within the radius of the rope. Stronger winds inside the tornado are just as likely to  pull your body from the rope (and possibly not in one piece).    ""A tornado can drive a straw through a telephone pole.""     FACT:  The forces inside a tornado are  incredible, and still poorly understood.  But they are certainly strong enough to turn otherwise harmless items into deadly missiles.      Anything can become a deadly projectile.    Click to visit NOAA Photo Library      ""A tornado is not coming directly at me, I am safe.""    MYTH:  Tornados have been known to act erratically,  often changing directions quickly.  Sturdy shelter is the only safe place to be during a tornado.  Although it may be tempting to  follow a tornado to get a cool photo, please leave the tornado chasing to trained meteorologists.          [ Top of Page  |  Overview  |    Myths and Facts  |  Safety: [      Preparation |  Watches  |     Warnings  |  Outdoors  |     Afterwards  ]        Tornado Safety     Preparation     Get a NOAA Weather Radio.  While the local media (radio or television) are a great source of relaying NWS tornado watches and  warnings, they are only useful if you happen to have them turned on.  The NOAA weather radio is on standby all the time, and will sound  an alarm the moment a tornado watch or warning has been issued.  If you are expecting severe weather, turn up the volume so you can  clearly hear the alert (especially important if you are a sound sleeper).    Have a plan.  If a tornado warning is issued, or you spot a tornado heading for you, what will you do - if you are at  home, at work, in your vehicle.  Spend a moment to think about it and review it each spring. During imminent danger is not the time  to have to think up a plan.    If your home does not have a safe place that can be used as a tornado shelter (as is the case with mobile homes),  find out where in your neighborhood is recommended as a tornado shelter.  Most properly managed mobile home parks should  have a severe weather plan in place, and such a plan is useful for any neighborhood or subdivision.  At work, ask your employer  for a copy of their severe weather safety plan.  They should have a location where employees can seek shelter in the event  of a tornado or other severe weather.     Put together a tornado/severe weather kit.  At the least, the kit should include:     a battery powered radio (preferably with weather channels)     a flashlight in working order (do not store with batteries installed) - there are battery-less flashlights now available     immediate first aid needs (bandages, antibiotic wipes, tweezers, etc.)      food (energy bars) and bottle of water      emergency blanket (foil lined to retain warmth)     large marking pen or bottle of spray paint (to write your address on the driveway, remains of structures for rescue personnel)     copies of any critical medical records     whistle (to help rescuers locate you)     Place your tornado kit inside the place you have designated as your tornado shelter.    If you own a home with a concrete foundation, a water/fireproof safe, bolted to the house foundation, for storage of any irreplaceable  documents can be a good choice.  These documents should be in the safe at all times.  Do not wait until a tornado warning is issued before  trying to put things in the safe.    Practice a tornado drill at least once per year for your family, school, or workplace. Ensure everyone knows what to do without having  to think about it.

Seek shelter immediately.    A shelter should be someplace that has sturdy and/or reinforced walls, preferably  in the interior and underground (or lowest level) of a building.  In  tornado alley , many  homes and businesses have dedicated storm cellars or clearly identified tornado shelters with a sign similar to the following:         FEMA advocates the creation of a  Safe Room  for surviving  tornadoes or other disasters.  Unfortunately, the construction of such rooms, especially in older structures or mobile homes may be impractical or cost  prohibitive.  However, many rooms in existing structures are safer places than others.     No room is safe in a mobile home.  Evacuate the home and go to a designated storm shelter.   In a home or building with a designated storm shelter, go there immediately.   In a house or building with a basement, go to the basement.  Current guidance is to shelter in the northeast corner of the  basement.  If the basement has a small interior room (such as a bathroom or closet) this should be your shelter.   In a house or building with a slab foundation (no basement), seek shelter toward the middle of the structure, in a small  room (such as a bathroom or closet) on the lowest floor.  The stout walls and possible plumbing pipes in the walls may offer additional protection.      If you live or work with a vision or hearing impaired person, inform them of the tornado warning, and if necessary, guide them to shelter.  If you live or work with an otherwise physically disabled individual, recognize that they may need assistance to get to shelter.    If you are in charge of safety for many people (e.g., workplace, school, etc.), you should enact your tornado safety plan.  Such a plan involves getting everyone in the building to safety immediately.  If you are unsure how to develop such a plan, please visit the  following website for  developing a tornado safety plan .  Although designed for  schools, it will work for most workplaces.  Also, most modern fire alarm systems can be enhanced to sound a unique ""seek shelter"" alarm that  is distinctly different from a fire alarm.  Such alarms can save much time in alerting all building occupants of an approaching tornado.    When you are in shelter, assume a safety position.  In general, this should be on your knees, bent over with your head against a wall and  covered with your arms.  If you are restricted to a wheel chair or cannot otherwise assume the standard safety position, you should place  yourself in such a way that you are offered maximum protection from the structure around you.  Others sheltering with you should assist  you in getting into a safe position.      Accepted tornado safety position   Click to visit the tornado safety page of the Indiana Dept. of Education     Do not waste any time trying to save personal belongings or opening windows, at the moment of a tornado,  the only things that are irreplaceable are your life and the lives of those around you.

Hail and lightning also often accompany tornadoes.    If you have no time, or there are no sturdy structures nearby, find a low place in the landscape and lay down.  Do not shelter  under a highway overpass if it can be avoided.    If you are in a car, it is recommended that you abandon your vehicle to seek shelter.  You will generally be safer outside the vehicle than in it.    Wreckage of a car on I-40 in Oklahoma after a direct hit by an F5 tornado   From KFOR-TV News (03 May, 1999)    Stay as low as possible.  Not only do winds increase with height above the ground, but the more exposed your body is,  the more likely you will be struck by flying debris and seriously injured or killed.    Avoid sheltering by solitary objects or groups of trees. Lightning often occurs with tornadoes.           [ Top of Page  |  Overview  |    Myths and Facts  |  Safety: [     Preparation  |  Watches  |     Warnings  |  Outdoors  |    Afterwards ]        Afterwards     A tornado will usually pass very quickly and the whole ordeal, while seemingly endless, will be over within 5 or 10 minutes.   Now is the time to assess the situation.    Assess your injuries (if any).    If you are not trapped or seriously injured, see to those who sheltered with you.  Apply first aid if able.    Call for rescue help on a cell phone if able (it is likely that local land lines will be out of service).    If you are not trapped or seriously injured, help to look for anyone who may be.    If you are trapped, do not panic.  You may be in a dangerous situation, and panicked movements may cause further injury.   Call for help.  If you have a cell phone, it may still work.    If there are few visible reference points remaining above ground, attempt to mark existing landmarks with addresses  so rescue personnel can navigate and respond effectively.    When trained emergency responders arrive, comply with their directives.

In fact, tornadoes have been documented in every one of the United States, and on every continent, with the exception of Antarctica (even there, a tornado occurrence is not impossible).  In fact, wherever the atmospheric conditions are exactly right, the occurrence of a tornadic storm is possible.  More on the conditions necessary for tornado formation can be found at the   NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory Tornado Page .    However, some parts of the world are much more prone to tornadoes than others. Globally, the middle latitudes, between about 30° and 50° North or South, provide the most favorable environment for tornadogenesis. This is the region where cold, polar air meets against warmer, subtropical air, often generating convective precipitation along the collision boundaries.  In addition, air in the mid-lattitudes often flows at different speeds and directions at different levels of the troposphere, facilitating the development of rotation within a storm cell.  Interestingly, the places that receive the most frequent tornadoes are also considered the most fertile agricultural zones of the world.  This is due in part to the high number of convective storms delivering needed precipitation to these areas.  Simply as a result of the large number of convective storms and the favorable environment, the odds are increased that some of these storms will produce tornadoes.    In terms of absolute tornado counts, the United States leads the list, with an average of over 1,000 tornadoes recorded each year.  A distant second is Canada, with around 100 per year.  Other locations that experience frequent tornado occurrences include northern Europe, western Asia, Bangladesh, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, China, South Africa and Argentina.  In fact, the United Kingdom has more tornadoes, relative to its land area, than any other country.  Fortunately, most UK tornadoes are relatively weak. [ Encyclopaedia Britannica Article ]    Regions of the world with increased likelihood of experiencing tornadoes.    Larger Map          top of the page        Tornado Alley    In the United States, there are two regions with a disproportionately high frequency of tornadoes.  Florida is one and ""Tornado Alley"" in the south-central U.S. is the other.  Florida has numerous tornadoes simply due to the high frequency of almost daily thunderstorms.  In addition, several tropical storms or hurricanes often impact the Florida peninsula each year.  When these tropical systems move ashore, the embedded convective storms in the rain bands often produce tornadoes.  However, despite the violent nature of a tropical storm or hurricane, the tornadoes they spawn (some as water spouts) tend to be weaker than those produced by non-tropical thunderstorms.    Tornado Alley is a nickname given to an area in the southern plains of the central U.S. that consistently experiences a high frequency of tornadoes each year.  Tornadoes in this region typically happen in late Spring and occasionally the early fall.  The Gulf Coast area has a separate tornado maximum nicknamed ""Dixie Alley"" with a relatively high frequency of tornadoes occurring in the late fall (October through December).     Strong to violent tornadoes (those of EF3 or stronger on the  Enhanced Fujita Tornado Damage Intensity Scale ), are relatively rare, and do not typically occur outside the United States.  Although the boundaries of Tornado Alley are debatable (depending on which criteria you use - frequency, intensity, or events per unit area), the region from central Texas, northward to northern Iowa, and from central Kansas and Nebraska east to western Ohio is often collectively known as Tornado Alley.  Meteorologically, the region known as Tornado Alley is ideally situated for the formation of supercell thunderstorms,often the producers of violent (EF2 or greater) tornadoes.    Overall, most tornadoes (around 77%) in the U.S. are considered weak (EF0 or EF1) and about 95% of all U.S. tornadoes are below EF3 intensity.  The remaining small percentage of tornadoes are categorized as violent (EF3 and above).  Of these violent twisters, only a few (0.1% of all tornadoes) acheive EF5 status, with estimated winds over 200 mph and nearly complete destruction.  However, given that on average over 1000 tornadoes hit the U.S. each year, that means that 20 can be expected to be violent and possibly one might be incredible (EF5).         U.S. Tornado Frequency and Tornado Alley        Click for larger image of Tornado Alley  From  Concannon et al, 2000        Click for larger image of Dixie Alley       Note: Tornado Alley has no agreed upon boundaries, these are just two representations based  upon different criteria.        top of the page      Timing    Because most tornadoes are related to the strength of a thunderstorm, and thunderstorms normally gain most of their energy from solar heating and latent heat released by the condensation of water vapor, it is not surprising that most tornadoes occur in the afternoon and evening hours, with a minimum frequency around dawn (when temperatures are lowest and radiation deficits are highest).  However, tornadoes have occurred at all hours of the day, and nighttime occurrences may give sleeping residents of a community little or no warning.      Tornado Occurrence by hour of day for the St. Louis Weather Forecast Office County Warning Area        In addition, tornadoes occur throughout the year.  Because a tornado may occur at any time of the day or year somewhere in the U.S., there really is no national tornado ""season"" (as there is with Atlantic hurricanes).  Instead, each region may experience increased tornadic potential at different times of the year.  Like with the diurnal pattern, for the United States (and hemisphere) as a whole, the months in which tornadoes are most likely correspond to the times of year with increased solar heating and strong frontal systems.  Regionally, the frequency of tornadoes in the United States is closely tied with the progression of the warm season when warm and cold air masses often clash.  Most of the early spring tornadoes in the U.S. tend to occur in the Southeast and South Central regions.  Gulf States, such as Mississippi and Louisiana are the frequent recipients of tornadoes from February to April.  Late spring tornadoes generally spread a bit farther north, often into Kansas, Nebraska and the Tennessee Valley region.  By mid-summer, most of Tornado Alley is active and tornadoes may occur throughout the U.S.  Late summer tends to bring some of the stronger tornadoes into the upper Midwest and Ohio valleys, and the pattern shifts back southward into the late autumn.  The fewest tornadoes are documented during the winter months.  Although rare, deadly winter outbreaks do occur.      Average tornado frequency by month of year 2003-2005          top of the page        Historical Records and Trends      Oldest Known Photograph of a Tornado (1884)     Click to visit NOAA Photo Library Page     One of the main difficulties with tornado records is that a tornado, or evidence of a tornado must have been observed.  Unlike rainfall or temperature, which may be measured by a fixed instrument, tornadoes are ephemeral and very unpredictable.  If a tornado occurs in a place with few or no people, it is not likely to be documented.  Unfortunately, much of what we know as tornado alley was very sparsely populated until the 20th century, and so it is possible that many significant tornadoes may never have made it into the historical record.    Much early work on tornado climatology in the U.S. was done by John Park Finley in his book  Tornadoes , published in 1887.  While some of Finley's safety guidelines have since been refuted as dangerous practices, the book itself remains a seminal work in tornado research.  The University of Oklahoma has created a pdf copy of the entire book and made it accessible at:  John Finley's 'Tornadoes'    Today, nearly all of the United States is reasonably well populated, or at least covered by NOAA's Doppler weather radars.  Even if a tornado is not actually observed, modern damage assessments by NWS personnel can discern if a tornado caused the damage, and if so, how strong the tornado may have been.  This disparity between tornado records of the past and current records contributes a great deal of uncertainty regarding questions about the long-term behavior or patterns of tornado occurrence.  In addition, even today many smaller tornadoes still may go undocumented in places with low populations or inconsistent communication facilities.     With increased national doppler radar coverage, increasing population, and greater attention to tornado reporting, there has been an increase in the number of tornado reports over the past several decades.  This can create a misleading appearance of an increasing trend in tornado frequency.  To better understand the true variability and trend in tornado frequency in the US, the total number of strong to violent tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 category on the Enhanced Fujita scale) can be analyzed.  These are the tornadoes that would have likely been reported even during the decades before Dopplar radar use became widespread and practices resulted in increasing tornado reports.  The bar chart below indicates there has been little trend in the frequency of the strongest tornadoes over the past 55 years.

Also, as a result of improved forecasting and early warning systems, the death toll from tornadoes has dropped significantly over the years, despite increasing populations in tornado-prone areas.  Unfortunately, super-violent tornadoes are still documented, some with exceptional death tolls.  Interestingly, a number of these devastating tornadoes have occurred outside of Tornado Alley, and several at times of day or year not normally associated with violent tornadoes.  Although all of most deadly tornadoes occurred prior to the invention of the Fujita Scale, historical records of their damage have led them to be classified as either F4 or F5.

The National Weather Service (NWS) defines a Tornado as a violently rotating column of air in contact with the earth surface (land or water) and commonly associated with a severe thunderstorm.   A tornado generally occurs when high winds within a low pressure system (such as a thunderstorm) cause water vapor in the air to condense in to a condensation funnel cloud.  Many less severe tornadoes are not even visible to the human eye.  Major tornadoes usually become more visible when the strong winds within the funnel lift up dirt and debris off the Earth surface.  Tornadoes are generally classified as either a land spout (a tornado on land), a water spout (a tornado that forms over water) or a gustnado (a small tornado caused by a strong downburst of wind from a thunderstorm).   The average tornado has maximum wind speeds of about 112 mph or less, measures around 250 feet in width and travels approximately one mile before falling apart.  Some of the most catastrophic tornadoes in recorded history have had winds in excess of 300 miles an hour (twice that of a category 5 hurricane), have measured more than 2 miles in girth, and have carved devastating paths of destruction miles and miles in length.

clueweb09-en0008-54-30379	"                               NOAA      News  ||  NOAA Home Page                TORNADOES OF THE 20TH CENTURY          December 29, 1999 — Severe weather      experts from  NOAA's Storm      Prediction Center  in Norman, Okla., have prepared a list      of some of the more notable tornado outbreaks that occurred in      the United States during the 20th century. The summary lists      the  tornadoes       by decade and notes the technological and policy improvements      that resulted.          ""For meteorologists who      study tornadic storms either through forecasting or research      or storm chasing, there are a number of memorable tornadoes or      tornado outbreaks during the 1900s,"" said Dan McCarthy,      warning coordination meteorologist for the Storm Prediction Center.      ""Many meteorologists are in the profession because of a      certain outbreak or tornado that spurred their curiosity, driving      them to the science.""          Technological advancements      in the second half of the century have contributed to better,      more accurate severe weather watches and warnings from the National      Weather Service, ultimately saving countless lives. The biggest      advancement for severe weather (forecasting was the development      of Doppler radar.  NOAA  scientists      and other researchers took the airborne radar developed by the      U.S. military during World War II and applied it to weather forecasting      and severe storm identification. The ultimate result was the      Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) Doppler weather radar system currently      in use.          Advancements in computer technology      also have created continued advancements in numerical weather      prediction, allowing meteorologists to apply physics in replicating      motions of the atmosphere. This, combined with diligent analysis      to recognize weather patterns, helped advance severe weather      prediction to its current level of an average lead time of over      11 minutes for tornado warnings issued by  National      Weather Service  forecasters.          The most impressive and devastating      tornado outbreak in the 20th century, McCarthy said, was the      Super Outbreak of April 3-4, 1974. The outbreak lasted 16 hours      and produced a total of 148 tornadoes across 13 states from Illinois,      Indiana and Michigan southward through the Ohio and Tennessee      Valleys into Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. This outbreak      produced more long-track tornadoes than any other, killing 315      people and injuring more than 5,000. The most notable individual      tornado was the one that moved into Xenia, Ohio, just before      4:30 p.m. It destroyed much of the town, including the town square      and high school, killing 35 people.          1900-1909:         The outbreak of April 24-26, 1908, included violent tornadoes      that moved through parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama,      killing 324 people and injuring 1,652 others. The worst damage      took place in Amite, La., where 29 people died.          1910-1919:       A long-track tornado on May 26, 1917, traveled across Illinois      and Indiana for 293 miles, lasting seven hours and 20 minutes.      The tornado killed 101 people and injured 638 others. Another      tornado moved through the town of Matoon, Ill., destroying everything      in a two and a half block-wide path for 2.5 miles.          1920-1929:       The Tri-State tornado of March 18, 1925, developed near Ellington,      Mo., and then for the next 3.5 hours killed more people and destroyed      more schools, homes and farmsteads than any other tornado to      this point in history. The tornado cut across southern Illinois      into southern Indiana, killing 695 people, 234 of them in the      town of Murphysboro, Ill., and injuring 2,027. Other tornadoes      occurred in Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. A total of nine      tornadoes were reported, leaving 747 dead and nearly 2,300 people      injured.          1930-1939:       On March 21-22, 1932, a total of 330 people died as a result      of tornadoes that touched down across northern Alabama. One tornado      hit the northeast part of the state, killing 38 and injuring      500.          During the Tupelo/Gainesville      outbreak on April 5-6, 1936, 17 tornadoes were scattered across      parts of northern Mississippi and northern Georgia. A massive      pair of tornadoes hit Gainesville, Ga., in the morning, killing      203 people and causing 1,600 injuries.          1940-1949:       Three major outbreaks occurred during this decade. The first,      on March 16, 1942, left 152 dead and 1,284 injured from tornadoes      that raked across parts of Illinois, Mississippi, Tennessee and      Kentucky. As many as 63 people perished in a tornado northwest      of Greenwood, Miss., that hit as buses carried school children      home. Five hundred people were injured.          A total of 154 people died      and nearly 1,000 were injured on June 23, 1944, as tornadoes      struck parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland and      Delaware. The worst areas affected were parts of northeast West      Virginia and western Maryland, where a tornado family killed      30 and injured 300.          On April 9, 1947, a tornado      outbreak that included eight tornadoes raked across parts of      Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. One tornado killed 107 people in      Woodward, Okla. Devastation covered 100 city blocks and 1,000      homes were damaged or destroyed. Cost of the damage at that time      was estimated at $6 million. Clean-up afterward was hampered      by cold and snow.          1950-1959:       On May 11, 1953, a violent tornado hit downtown Waco, Texas,      killing 114 people and destroying about 200 business buildings.      Heaps of bricks up to five feet high filled the streets. Survivors      were buried for up to 14 hours.          A tornado outbreak in early      June 1953 produced two major tornadoes. On June 8, a tornado      hit in Flint, Mich., leaving 116 people dead. The next day, June      9, a tornado described as ""a huge cone of black smoke""      carrying debris eastward over the Boston area and out over the      Atlantic Ocean caused 94 deaths and nearly 1,300 injuries in      Worcester, Mass. In the United States, the death toll was 116      from tornadoes in Michigan, Ohio, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.      Other tornadoes occurred in Canada.          The hardest-hit area from a      tornado outbreak in Oklahoma and Kansas on May 25, 1955, was      Udall, Kansas. Eighty people were known dead and 270 were injured,      which was more than half of the people in Udall, and the town      was destroyed. For the entire outbreak, tornadoes killed 102      people and injured 563.          A tornado moved across southeast      parts of Kansas City hitting the area of Ruskin Heights on May      20, 1957. Forty-four people were killed and 531 were injured.      More than 825 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed,      including the local high school. The outbreak itself spread from      northeast Kansas and northeast Oklahoma through Missouri into      Iowa and Illinois. In all, 17 tornadoes killed 59 people and      injured 665 others.          1960-1969:       The second most damaging outbreak of the century, known as the      Palm Sunday outbreak, occurred April 11-12, 1965. Nearly 50 tornadoes      struck parts of the Great Lakes region from Wisconsin and Illinois      eastward through lower Michigan and northern Ohio. The outbreak      resulted in 256 deaths and 3, 402 injuries. Twin tornadoes moved      into Goshen, Ind., destroying nearly 100 trailer homes. A large      tornado hit Russiaville, Ind., damaging or destroying 90 percent      of the buildings. As many as 44 people died and 612 were injured      as one tornado followed another tornado across Steuben and Monroe      Counties in lower Michigan. Tornadoes devastated areas in northern      Toledo, Ohio, killing 18 people. Other tornadoes moved through      areas about 15 miles southwest of Cleveland just northeast of      Strongsville. Six homes literally vanished, 18 people were killed      and 200 others were injured.          On June 8, 1966, a tornado      brought massive damage to Topeka, Kansas, causing $100 million      in damage. This became the most expensive tornado to date.           1970-1979:       The most prolific tornado outbreak of the 20th century was the       Super Outbreak      of April 3-4, 1974 . During a 16-hour period, 148 tornadoes      occurred from Illinois and Indiana into Michigan and Ohio southward      through the Tennessee Valley into Mississippi and Alabama. This      outbreak produced the largest number of tornadoes, with 30 causing      F4 damage or worse. On one occasion, as many as five large tornadoes      were on the ground at one time. The outbreak killed 315 people      and resulted in 6,142 injuries. One tornado hit Xenia, Ohio,      at 4:30 p.m., moved through the center of town and demolished      the high school. Thirty-four people died and 1,150 were injured      in Xenia as 300 homes were destroyed and 2,100 homes were damaged.          Five years later, a tornado      hit Wichita Falls, Texas, on April 10, 1979, killing 42 people      and injuring 1,740.          1980-1989:       Thirty tornadoes spread out across parts of northeast Ohio into      western Pennsylvania on May 31, 1985. The outbreak killed 76      people and injured 876 others. Twelve people died from one tornado      that moved from Ashtabula County, Ohio, into Erie County, Penn.      Sixteen people were killed by a tornado that started over Trumbull      County, Ohio, then moved east/northeast across parts of Pennsylvania.          Another outbreak moved across      Iowa and Minnesota into Wisconsin on June 7-8, 1984. The town      of Barneveld, Wisc., was hit by a tornado just before midnight.      All but the water tower was demolished and nine people were killed.      As many as 45 tornadoes in the entire outbreak killed 13 people.          1990-1999:       The role of video tape and the advances in media technology provided      many breath-taking views of tornadoes in the 1990s. People came      from miles around to film the Hesston, Kansas, tornado on March      13, 1990. One tornado started near Goshen, only to merge with      a second near Hesston and track northeast to just southwest of      Topeka, Kansas.       Another notable Palm Sunday tornado occurred on March 27, 1994,      when 22 people died in Goshen, Ala., after a tornado hit a church.          Most recently, a large tornado      mowed through areas of southwest Oklahoma City and Moore, Okla.,      on May 3, 1999, demolishing or damaging more than 8,000 homes      and ringing up more than $1 billion in damage. This tornado was      part of an outbreak of 74 tornadoes that affected parts of Oklahoma      and southern Kansas, killing 48 people.          Advancements in communications      through radio and television helped issue advanced watches and      warnings to the public. Plus, meteorological advancements from      research in storm structure using Doppler radar helped forecasters      identify tornadic storms, improving warnings from a few minutes      to as many as 20 minutes and increasing public response.

clueweb09-en0005-59-36546	"       Chuck Doswell's    F requently   A sked   Q uestions      about    Storm Chasing  and  Tornadoes        Last Update :  05 March 2001 ... added Item #38 and made a number of small changes, including adding some new links here and there.    Disclaimer : The contents of this FAQ list are solely the opinions of Chuck Doswell, and have no official status associated with my workplace. They have been provided here in response to numerous questions of late, perhaps spawned by the  movie  ""Twister. ""   Mention of commercial products and Websites does not constitute an endorsement, and  especially  not an endorsement by the Federal Government.                1. How do I become a storm chaser?    Becoming a storm chaser can be as simple as choosing to do so. However, just going out and chasing storms can become hazardous to you in a variety of ways (see my essay on  chasing ). If you go out without taking advantage of what has been learned about storm chasing, you are already behaving irresponsibly! My recommendation is to  not  do storm chasing! If you  must  try it, go out with an experienced storm chaser for at least one chase season, preferably more, before trying it on your own.    Another option is to obtain training by volunteering to be a  storm spotter  for your local community. This option involves making a serious commitment to be of service to your community, not simply taking advantage of the training for your own selfish ends. However, you can enhance your value as a storm spotter by chasing and learning about severe weather in doing so. Keith Brewster has provided a useful  document  about how to become a spotter. Being a spotter is  not  the same thing as being a chaser, although many folks do both. More on this later.    2. Do I need to be a meteorologist to be a storm chaser?    Not at all. There are many veteran storm chasers who have virtually no meteorological education. However, the good ones have learned a great deal about the atmosphere on their own and have become ""meteorologists without a degree"" as they have acquired knowledge about severe storms. If you are going to be a successful chaser, you're going to have to learn about how to be in the right place at the right time, and you can't depend on anyone else to get you there. It's in your best interests to learn as much about meteorology as you can!    3. How do I avoid the dangers of storm chasing?    This question is a complex one and I recommend you read my essay on  chasing  for a detailed answer. The dangers of chasing, in my opinion, are (in order of importance):    1. Driving on the highways 2. Being struck by lightning 3. Getting into the path of dangerous storms      4. How realistic was the movie ""Twister""?    The movie was quite an  unrealistic  presentation of real storm chasing. Even good real storm chasers can spend ten or more days without seeing a tornado for every day of seeing a tornado! They pass many long hours driving, eating bad food, and staying in bad motels for every minute of tornado action. It is very easy for even the best of us to make incorrect chase decisions and miss the action. Most of storm chasing, by far, is frustration and failure, punctuated by occasional dramatic experiences. If you want life-threatening danger to flood your body with adrenaline, try jumping out of airplanes, not storm chasing! The dangers are there, but you will not experience them very often (apart from any hazards of driving).    Real storm chasing is  not  like the ""tornado chasing"" the movie shows. It's very difficult even to get within 5 miles of a tornado, much less have 4 tornadoes roll over you within one 24 hour period. And having real tornadoes roll over you isn't going to result in you emerging more or less without a scratch (to say nothing of the likelihood of being brought out in a body bag!). Real chasers don't stop in the middle of a chase for steak & eggs, and a shower, and then go out and find another tornado. A lot of the chaser jargon used in the movie (like  suck zone, sidewinder, shifting updraft , or  sisters ) was made up for the movie; chasers don't currently use such terms. The few examples of  real  storm shots, like the one at the beginning of the movie, where Bill Harding (Bill Paxton's character) remarks that the ""...sky is talking..."" are handled unrealistically. I recognized that sequence immediately as being from 05 June 1995 (see my  1995 chase summary ) near Jayton, TX. Any chaser seeing that mesocyclone for the first time would be going ballistic, not making an offhand comment and and then going back to whatever he/she was doing.    There also are many, many technical errors in the special effects, even though they certainly are dramatic and better than most previous attempts to include tornadoes in movies. For example,    1. The tornadoes seem to be dominated by  outflow  at low levels, even though real tornadoes have strong  inflow  near the surface ... with the ""F5"" at the end of the movie, note the windmill near the farm implement lot swinging to  face  the tornado, as if it is experiencing outflow.    2. The tornadoes are shown hanging from clouds that don't look anything like storm clouds.    3. When vehicles become airborne in tornadoes, they usually are rolled and flattened before becoming airborne, so that pristine combines and tanker trucks typically don't fall intact out of the sky.    4. The scene with hail was clearly  not  hail, but crushed ice ... even the ordinary citizens in the theater where I saw the movie first were laughing about that one ... Okies recognize hail when they  don't  see it!    I could go on, but it's not really necessary. In summary, no one should ever believe that what they have seen in the movie is, in fact, realistic. The realism in the movie is pretty thin!    5. How many tornadoes has Chuck Doswell seen?    Please don't ask me this question. I'm not interested in indulging in silly games about the number of ""notches"" in my gun. I've seen  many  tornadoes simply because I've been chasing since 1972. I'm not the world's best storm chaser, nor do I have any desire to be known as such.    6. What was Chuck Doswell's scariest storm chase?    I don't like this question, either. The only time storm chasing really frightened me was in June of 1973, when we hydroplaned on wet roads while driving between storms. [That experience has made us very cautious and it has not happened again.] I do  not  chase for the danger and the heart-pounding fear. If I feel any real concern about what the storm I am chasing might do to me, I simply do not stay in a place where I feel I might be in danger. My excitement from chasing comes from having a chance to see a complex and rare demonstration of Nature's power ... it's probably more like the ""buck fever"" that hunters experience when they find their elusive quarry than what bungee-cord jumpers must feel. [I neither hunt nor do bungee-cord jumping, so I can only speculate on the feelings of those who do!]    7. Why chase storms?    Another question I dislike. People have their own reasons for chasing, and it really is not anyone else's business why  I  do so. I've had a lifelong fascination with tornadoes. My  career  as a meteorologist springs directly from that fascination; I didn't believe I could learn about tornadoes without seeing them, and I still hold to that philosophy. There are many places to get some insights about chasing: see the  Chasing FAQ  by Roger Edwards and Tim Vasquez, an  essay  on the subject by Dave Hoadley, and some of the articles in the  20th Anniversary Issue  of  Storm Track  magazine.    8. Can I go chasing with Chuck Doswell?    Sorry. I do not enjoy ""tag-along"" chasers, either in our vehicle or following along behind us. Although I have recommended you chase with someone experienced for awhile, I am  not  available for this purpose, so  don't ask . My chase season is limited to an approximately 3-week ""window"" each year and constitutes my vacation. During my chase vacation, I am not chasing in any official capacity; I am on annual leave, and I would prefer not to have someone tagging along on my vacation. Would you like me to accompany you on  your  holiday? We have limited space in our vehicle and while I can't prevent you from following us in your own vehicle, I'll not like it very much! Besides, I get numerous such requests every year. If I respond positively to one, why not to all? Then, it would take a bus to carry my ""chase crew"" ... the obvious solution is to respond to  all  such requests the same way. If you want a chase partner, see the next item.    9. How do I get in touch with someone to be my chase partner?     My only suggestion is to visit the  Storm Chase Homepage  and ""advertise"" your interest in finding a chase partner. At the moment, experienced storm chasers are vastly outnumbered by the chaser ""wannabes"" so it may be difficult to find a chase tutor. There also are storm chase ""tours"" linked from the Storm Chase Homepage, where you can buy a ""packaged"" storm chase vacation, with an experienced storm chasing ""guide"". Try:  Silver Lining Tours ,  Tempest Tours , or  Cloud 9 Tours  ...  the presence of these links at this site does not constitute a commercial endorsement of these tours on my part . I simply am providing these links as a service ... specifically, I disavow any responsibility for what you may experience resulting from your participation on a storm chasing tour.    10. What gear should I bring along on a storm chase?    Another unfavorite question. It's not my responsibility to be the storm chase equivalent of an ""outfitter"" and what you choose to bring along on a chase ought to be your own business. I don't know your reasons for chasing and that surely has a big impact on what you choose to bring along. Surely you can make your own choices for personal gear. Experience is a great teacher and if you find you brought along stuff you didn't use and/or needed things you didn't have, then you'll know better the next time. That's the process I've used.    11. Where can I get more information about storms (and/or meteorology)?    Try the Storm Chaser Homepage or  WeatherNet . You can also use any of the Internet  search engines  to pursue specific topics. However,  if you truly are interested in serious learning about meteorology, the Internet is not the place for such a pursuit . I suggest you go to your local libraries and read everything you can find on the subject. If you live near a college or university, check them out, especially if they offer courses in meteorology. Even if they do not have a meteorology department as such, they usually have a geography department that will have access to meteorological information. Visit your  local office  of the  National Weather Service ; they have pamphlets and information about storms to distribute to the public. Contact  NOAA's Public Affairs  office and ask them to send you information. Subscribe to  Storm Track  magazine     12. Where can I get tornado and other storm photographs or video?     Try contacting:  Storm Track  Merchandise ,  Warren Faidley ,  Prairie Pictures , or  The Tornado Project . The  NSSL Employees Association  also has images for sale. I own the copyright to most of the images in my Website and I  will  pursue copyright infringement litigation for unauthorized use.    13. If I chase storms, what are my responsibilities regarding reporting what I see?    I've discussed some of this in my essay on chasing. If someone sees a tornado that might strike a community without warning, I believe anyone's conscience would require them to do their best to report the tornado. If you have knowledge that the situation is in hand (warning sirens are going, or you hear warnings on the radio), then you may choose to go about your own chase business. Let your conscience be your guide.    Arguably, the best way to report a tornado is to become a licensed amateur radio operator and contact the local spotting networks to report what you are seeing. Be aware that some of these networks are tightly controlled and may not want reports from unauthorized persons. Given the complexities of spotting and amateur radio in general, this FAQ list cannot provide a detailed discussion of all the ins and outs of amateur radio tornado spotting. [see the Keith Brewster page mentioned above.] The  spotting program  often goes under the name  SKYWARN .    Lacking an amateur radio operator's license and gear, a Citizen's Band radio might work as an acceptable substitute. Also, a cellular phone might be useful for the purpose of reporting. See the Storm Chaser Homepage for more information about reporting what you see. Lacking some ""instant"" communication system (like a cell phone or a 2-way radio of some sort), it's not clear that chasers actually can offer much help in terms of spreading the word of an approaching tornado.    Generally speaking, if you are a storm chaser and you are in or near a community that already has been struck by a tornado, common sense ought to prevail:    1. If you see casualties and there is no one else about, a good conscience would suggest that you stop and render first aid. Most states have ""Good Samaritan"" laws that will protect you from lawsuits ... but if you lack the knowledge to help a seriously injured person, you also need to consider whether or not you would do more harm than good by attempting to help. If the choice is to stand by and simply let someone die, then by all means try to help, of course. Learning CPR and First Aid is probably not a bad thing for all chasers to do.    2. Unless you are asked to help by local emergency officials, you probably should  get out and stay out  of any tornado-damaged areas. At the very least, you could be getting in the way of responsible help-givers, and you may be taken for a gawker or even a potential looter by the police.      Even if you make a report in real time, but especially if you don't, please  report what you saw  in terms of severe weather to the nearest office of the National Weather Service at some point, even if it is days after the event. It helps to have precise locations of the events (not  your  location necessarily, but where the event occurred), and times of occurrence. Doing this ensures that what you saw can become part of the official climatological record of what happened. The  official  criteria for severe weather are: 1) hail 2 cm [3/4 inch] in diameter, or larger, 2)wind gusts 25 meters per second [58 mph] or higher, 3) certain types of straight-line wind damage [trees uprooted, significant damage to homes and structures, etc.], 4) any tornado.     14. How do tornadoes form?    This is far from being completely understood. See my essays on tornadoes: (1)  thoughts  after VORTEX and (2)  defining  a tornado. Basically, we currently believe many tornadoes come from supercell storms but some tornadoes are produced by non-supercell storms. A supercell is a rotating storm, but not all tornadoes come from supercells and not all supercells produce tornadoes. Trying to understand more about tornadoes was a major purpose of the  VORTEX project . Tornadoes develop from weaker vortices that ""spin up"" into tornadoes. Under the right conditions, the initial weak vortex undergoes a process called ""stretching"" ... not unlike the way an ice skater spins up by pulling in his/her arms ... in physical terms, this is known as  conservation of angular momentum . Once it begins, the development of a tornado can proceed very quickly ... in a matter of a few minutes. The weaker vortices that sometimes become tornadoes apparently can form in a number of different ways, so not all tornadoes have the same origins. Where storms seem to differ from each other is in the way the weak vortex that spins up into a tornado is created ... some storms don't seem to create them at all, others create the weak vortices but for reasons not understood, they don't go on to become tornadoes, some storms create tornado-like vortices aloft but they never intensify at the surface, and a few seem to create tornadoes from these weaker vortices pretty easily. All of the complexity of the real atmosphere makes this question a  lot  harder to answer than you might think. Progress has been made, but a simple, comprehensive answer to the question seems unlikely any time soon.    15. Where and when should I go to chase tornadoes?    There are two ways to answer this question. The  first  is the  climatological  version: in general, tornadoes are most frequent in what is commonly called ""Tornado Alley"" (see Figure 1), during the months from April to June. The central plains of the United States have the most frequent and most violent tornadoes of anyplace on the planet, but they can occur at other times and places, including other countries (e.g., France, Russia, Australia, Argentina, India, South Africa, Canada, and others). If you're planning a chase vacation, the most ""chase-able"" tornadoes (i.e., tornadoes during daylight, not moving too fast to chase and not so wrapped in clouds and rain that they're difficult to see, in country without a lot of hills, trees, and buildings) are most common in Tornado Alley, from early May through mid-June. Obviously, depending on the overall weather pattern, the focus for tornadic activity during  your  chase vacation may shift to some place other than the climatologically-favored region.       Figure 1. Chuck Doswell's version of Tornado Alley. This does not necessarily agree with actual observed distributions of tornadoes ... many tornadoes go unreported in the sparsely-populated High Plains.    The  second  way to answer this question is the  day-by-day  version: basically, an accurate forecast is difficult because our state of knowledge does not permit precise forecasts of when and where tornadoes are going to occur. Therefore, you shouldn't expect to have someone else answer it for you. Learn how to make your own forecasts! And you'll have to deal with the inevitable mistakes (bad forecasts).    16. Does ""Dorothy"" or something like it (as seen in ""Twister"") actually exist?    In the movie ""Twister,"" the chasers are trying to deploy something called ""Dorothy"" that consists of a large number of instrument packages inside plastic ""bubbles"" that will send data about the tornado back to the chasers. The container holding these sensors looks to be modeled after a real instrument package called ""TOTO"" (for TOtable Tornado Observatory) that was developed by Dr. Al Bedard of ERL in Boulder. The idea was for a chaser to put TOTO down in the path of a tornado so that data from the passage of the tornado would be recorded on magnetic tape. TOTO was roughly the size of a 55 gallon oil drum and was designed to stay put (hopefully) during the passage of a tornado. For a number of years, it was carried about during storm chases by Prof. Howard Bluestein of the  School of Meteorology , University of Oklahoma. Then, TOTO was given to NSSL to attempt deployment. All these efforts were essentially unsuccessful because it's difficult to put objects in the path of a tornado! Only once was TOTO put nearly into the tornado path; that particular chase effort is ""immortalized"" by the PBS ""NOVA"" program on tornadoes that aired first in 1986. TOTO has been ""retired"" for a number of years and now rests quietly in the NOAA museum in Silver Spring, Maryland.    As it now stands, the technology that ""Dorothy"" uses is probably within our real capabilities (especially with respect to Department of Defense technology), but only if tornado research programs get significant increases in their funding ... no one is really developing these in the back of an RV! There are several technical barriers to achieving that sort of a probe of a tornado (although with enough funding anything becomes possible).    Perhaps most important, having such a ""swarm"" of sensors within the circulation of a tornado would not provide all that much of value for tornado forecasts and warnings. Knowledge of the actual processes going on in a tornado are of considerable scientific interest, but it is quite unlikely that such knowledge would lead to increased warning lead times (which was stated during the movie). To increase the warning lead times, we need to know more about how and why tornadoes form in some storms and not in others. Moreover, we need to sample many storms. Probing one example doesn't really represent all that much of a potential breakthrough ... every storm is different. During VORTEX, scientists attempted to deploy an improved version of TOTO, called ""turtles."" More information about the VORTEX turtles can be found  here . At least one successful deployment of turtles was done during VORTEX, but the results are not yet available.    17. Why does ""Tornado Alley"" have so many tornadoes?    The idea of ""Tornado Alley"" is not a scientific one ... it's something that has been created by the media. However, it is certainly true that tornado frequency varies around the United States (and, indeed, around the world). Some places have pretty high tornado frequencies compared to the rest of the world and it's inevitable that someone wants to call such locations by the term ""Tornado Alley.""    However, at face value, this question is pretty difficult to answer. If we don't understand tornado formation completely (and we don't) then we couldn't possibly explain why some regions have a higher frequency of tornadoes than others. Nevertheless, I  can  say this much: the unique geography of the plains east of the Rockies make it a region with high tornado frequency during early and middle spring. In late winter and early spring, tornadoes also occur with relatively high frequency in the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico. Although it is simplistic to use the notion of the ""clash of air masses"" that is so popular in the media, the juxtaposition of    (1) dry, unstable air from the west, on top of (2) low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, and in the presence of (3) strong temperature contrasts to develop vertical wind shear      produces conditions favorable for the development of supercells, and it seems that most strong and violent tornadoes come from supercells. Anything that promotes supercells also makes tornadoes more likely. The Great Plains and the Southeast show the highest risks of tornadoes, and so could collectively make up a region someone might want to call ""Tornado Alley,"" but even within the local peaks of tornado frequency, tornadoes (especially the violent kind) are still pretty  rare events  ... whereas outside of the peak frequency regions, tornadoes are even less frequent  but still possible . If a tornado is possible, I know of no reason why a  violent  tornado is not possible, as well. Ask the citizens of Worcester, Massachusetts, or Edmonton, Alberta (in Canada).    Many  tornadoes happen outside of  anyone's  version of ""Tornado Alley"" so living outside of the regions of peak frequency in the U.S. does not make anyone safe from tornadoes ... they've happened in every state, and they'll happen again in those locations, if you wait long enough. If you live in a place where tornadoes can happen, but you've convinced yourself somehow that tornadoes  don't  happen where you live, then you may not take appropriate actions to prepare yourself for the rare, but real risk of a tornado.     18. How do chasers know when a tornado is changing its direction of movement?    This question has become surprisingly common, obviously triggered by the abilities shown by the Bill Harding character in ""Twister."" There are some occasions in the movie where Bill's profound ""understanding"" of storms allows him to anticipate changes in a tornado's movement. Most of Bill's apparent ability is pure fiction. Tornado movement is dominated by movement of the storm that produces the tornado, and for the most part, tornadoes do  not  exhibit the erratic movement so popular in movies (including those in ""Twister"" and the swaying back and forth of the tornado in ""The Wizard of Oz""). When tornadoes make sudden changes in direction, it's typically whenever they are affected by an outflow .... as in the beautiful Cordell, Oklahoma tornado movie shot on 22 May 1981 by Howie Bluestein. In such cases, the tornadoes are usually on a rapid road to dissipation. In some cases, it  might  be possible to anticipate the impact of an outflow boundary on a tornado, but it's certainly going to be difficult to do so until the change is already underway. I know that I'm not that good!    19. In ""Twister"" at the end, they show the inside of a tornado that has a clear ""eye"" extending from the ground up into the clouds. Is this true?    It is important to keep in mind that  ""Twister"" is just a movie  and any resemblance between what is shown in the movie and reality is purely coincidental! Within the core of any vortex, there must be a point where the rotating part of the wind goes to zero ... if the tornado's moving, the air at that point must be moving with the same speed as the vortex ... otherwise, it'd be flowing out of the tornado. Is there really a clear ""eye"" in tornadoes, as there is in tropical cyclones but on a smaller scale? Again, not all tornadoes are the same, but at least some tornadoes have an eye-like structure ... as shown in some special radar data collected during the VORTEX. However, we've no scientific observations that would confirm or deny that it is clear within such an ""eye."" It appears quite possible, but no one really knows for sure. From a scientific viewpoint, this isn't the most compelling issue ...in other words, it's not a top scientific priority to know whether or not tornadoes have clear ""eyes.""    20. How do I become a professional storm chaser?    Chasing as a career is basically not an option ... storm chasing is not a profession. To date, the only ways I know of to make money from chasing are:    a.  Sell storm photographs and video . In effect, this is NOT being paid to chase ... it is being paid to be a photographer or videographer of storms. In order to be successful at this to any real extent, you need to be a photographer and/or videographer of some considerable skill to compete in the image markets, and have some knowledge of business. Plus, you will need to be a good storm chaser!    b.  Chase storms for a TV station . In some parts of the country (including those of us here in central Oklahoma), TV stations have hired chasers to get them live and recorded storm footage. I have no clue what they pay their chasers, but I doubt if they will be paying them outside of the local ""storm season"" unless they are doing something else for the station during the rest of the year. Thus, this hardly qualifies as a ""career"" either.    c.  Give guided ""chase tours""  There are enough new people wanting to chase storms that some folks are attempting to fill this niche by giving ""chase tours."" Naturally, this will require some considerable investment in vehicles, etc.; riding herd on a number of people doesn't strike  me  as much fun (personality clashes, trying to find motel rooms at the end of a chase day, keeping track of everyone, listening to complaints about not seeing a tornado, etc.). If anyone makes much income this way, they will  earn  every dime, in my opinion. It will be a very seasonal business, so they have to make enough from their customers to continue to eat during the time of year when storms are rare, unless they have some other income source. I'm willing to bet that a lot of unsatisfied customers (with unrealistic expectations of what they will see) will be a continuing source of trouble.    There may be some very limited opportunities for a few folks to make enough income to survive from one or more of these three options, or some option about which I don't know, but storm chasing is hardly a mass market. You'll need to have some important skills apart from chasing in order to survive, either in marketing or business, as well as such skills as photography/videography. Please accept the fact that chasing is basically a  hobby  (and an expensive one!) that you  might  at best be able to earn enough from to make it pay for itself. There are not likely ever to be true professional storm chasers! There are scientists who may chase storms for scientific purposes, but they're not professional storm chasers, either ... they're scientists who use storm chasing to learn about storms.    21. What's the relationship between storm  chasing  and storm  spotting  ?    Storm spotters  are mostly unpaid volunteers who serve their local communities in mitigating the impacts of hazardous events like tornadoes. They're generally not allowed to roam freely about, chasing whatever storms they wish. Rather, they have a job to do and they've generously volunteered their time on behalf of the citizens in their community. Chasing is basically irresponsible activity (or, perhaps somewhat less pejoratively,  self-centered  activity), done by individuals who, for reasons of their own (some good, some not-so-good), want to see storms.    22. I want to build a ""toy"" tornado vortex model. Can I get plans or ideas about how to do this?    An effort to produce something on this topic by several of us (at OU/NSSL) has been on the back burner for a looong time ... please see the following  site  for information about how to acquire a tape that, among other things, teaches you how to build low-cost tornado models.    23. I've heard about a method for detecting tornadoes by the sounds they make. How does this work?    Sorry, this isn't something I know anything about. Please check out the  Website  created by Dr. Al Bedard of NOAA's Environmental Technology Laboratory.    24. What about the famous, extremely damaging tornadoes, like  Jarrell , Texas this year (27 May 1997), or the  Tri-State tornado  of 18 March 1925? How should these events be handled?     I've written extensively about what is  normal , elsewhere. It's typical of weather that the  extreme  events are  rare   events. Because extreme damage is rare, we really don't know very much about such events. A related sort of rare event is a violent tornado in a region not known for frequent tornadoes, like the Worcester, Massachussetts tornado of 09 June 1953. Of course, if violent tornadoes are rare in general (say one event out of 100), and tornadoes of  any  intensity are rare in some location, it's still possible for a violent event to occur in a place where tornadoes are rare ... but they will not happen very often, right? Tornadoes are rare events to begin with, and the occasional violent examples are on the margins of an already rare event. When such events do happen  somewhere  (and some when  ), as they inevitably must, they're memorable and tend to stand out as a result. Perhaps they stand out  too  much ... they're always in some sense unrepresentative of the ""average tornado"" (whatever  that  might mean!).    Our records really contain too few such extreme events to be confident we know such things as how often they occur, or where they're most common. The Tri-State tornado is particularly disturbing, as we've not seen anything even remotely like it since then, and there are perhaps some reasons to question whether or not it was a single tornado ... the available data are subject to different interpretations because the hard facts about such storms in 1925 are pretty sparse. What we  do  know about tornado climatology says that there will be something on the order of 5-20 violent tornadoes (F4-F5) in any given year ... we certainly do not have a clear idea of where or when they will occur. If we ever see something like the Tri-State tornado again, it clearly is a rare event , well out on the margins of rare events! There've probably been an average of at least 1000 tornadoes per year since 1925 (although the climatological record shows far fewer, of course), so the Tri-State event is something like 1 in 72, 000, at least!! Until we have something like it again, we don't know how large that number is going to go. I have an essay on some  realities about tornadoes  that's relevant to the occasional violent tornadoes like Jarrell, or whatever. If we're willing to wait long enough (say, millions of years), there's no telling what we might see in terms of extremes ... but we have a fair ways to go before we enter our thousandth year of observing tornadoes with something like scientific care. Most of us aren't going to live that long.    Ultimately, it's very difficult to anticipate the occurrence of an extreme event, to recognize that the situation has become extreme, and to convey that recognition to anyone such that it would help. That is, it's unlikely that anyone would forecast another Tri-State or Jarrell tornado (we are very uncertain about many aspects of the meteorology of these extreme events), it's not obvious that such an extreme tornado could be recognized for what it is in time for that recognition to do anyone any good and, since tornadoes are rapidly-changing processes, by the time word got out, the situation might well have changed. It seems to me that what we need to do is to get the public to prepare for the worst, because we meteorologists aren't likely ever to be able to guarantee that the worst will  not  happen! It probably won't happen ... that's the nature of rare events (and an extreme tornado is a rare example of an already rare event) ... but it would be foolish to assume that an particular tornado is  not  going to do extreme damage.    25. How effective are NWS tornado forecast products and are they improving in accuracy?    Please consult the latest  Policy Statement  by the American Meteorological Society. You might also want to consult my essay about the realities about tornadoes, mentioned just above. The effectiveness of NWS tornado forecast products depends on more than just the accuracy of the forecasts! As noted above, public education is an important factor in the reduction of casualties (and damage!) from tornadoes.    26. I've got an idea: why not use bombs (or flames, or liquid nitrogen, or whatever) to disrupt tornadoes?    This is an idea that seems to occur to  many  folks and superficially it seems plausible. If we set off a big enough explosion (or whatever) to disrupt the tornado, it would save all those lives and all that property. I have a number of points to make about this rather old idea:         The tornado is a process embedded within a larger process.    Disrupting a tornado with explosions or whatever could probably be    made to work if the explosion is big enough (see my next point),    but the processes that produced the tornado (the supercell    thunderstorm) are still going on and almost surely will create    another tornado in short order. To disrupt the supercell would    require titanic energies (see  Item #2 ) at least 10 times    greater than those of the tornado itself.         The cure (in the case of explosions or exothermic reactions)    could be worse than the problem you are trying to alleviate.    Citizens might justifiably resent having bombs exploding over    their property, or having liquid nitrogen-cooled air descend on    their crops.         Adding cold into a downdraft would certainly enhance it. Is    this really going to have a detrimental effect on a tornado? No    one knows.         Have you considered the volumes of air that flow through    supercell thunderstorm up- and downdrafts? We are talking about    many cubic kilometers of air passing through the circulations. The    amount of energy that it would take to change the temperature    (either heating or cooling) of the air passing through either the    updraft or the downdraft would be huge. Sit down and calculate    what amount of energy is needed to change the temperature of one    cubic kilometer of air by one degree Celsius, and then figure that    a reasonably strong storm processes something on the order of    70-100 cubic kilometers of air every 20 minutes or so. Big chunks    of energy are involved here and the price of energy is an    important factor.     I am not convinced we are talking about something practical (economically viable), even if it managed to be successful in suppressing the tornado.  Consider the following cost discussion:     If you want to do explosions instead of heating or cooling the air,  assume  that in order to disrupt the tornado, you need the equivalent of about 1 kiloton of TNT. [I'm assuming that nuclear or thermonuclear detonations are out of the question for obvious reasons!] What is the cost of that much explosive? What method are you going to use to deliver it to the right place, quickly? It isn't going to be via any motor vehicle, but must necessarily be some sort of aircraft delivery system. Assume an effective delivery system (like an air-to-air missile from a jet aircraft) costs roughly $1 million, for each missile. I have no clue what it would cost to operate an aircraft capable of delivering such a device, but it certainly is not like renting a car! Don't forget to include the cost of the pilot and any other aircraft crew, plus the maintenance costs for the aircraft, plus hangar fees, plus the maintenance crew and lodging for everyone, plus training for this specialized mission, plus practice runs. Figure on the training and overhead for a crew of 10 people to coordinate all of this activity. In order to deliver the ""cure"" to any location in the tornado-prone part of the U.S., even using jet aircraft, you will need about 100 crews ... remember, the typical tornado only lasts a few minutes. Including all the overhead associated with the delivery system, a conservative estimate would be that each shot would cost several million dollars. We are talking Department of Defense-type systems, here.    Once you know the approximate cost of doing this exercise once for a single tornado, then multiply that by roughly 1000, for each reported tornado. That amounts to something like several billion dollars per year. Balance all this against the annual tornado damage figures (on the average, about $500 million). If the cost of carrying out this exercise is not less than that damage figure, which it isn't, it's not worth doing even if it  could  be made to work.     We're much better off putting resources into improving forecasts and warnings for tornadoes than we would be trying to prevent them by silly ""brute force"" methods along these lines. Moreover, we've no idea what atmospheric consequences might arise if all tornadoes were successfully suppressed. In my opinion, unless we can be reasonably sure of the consequences, it'd be dangerous to interfere with the atmosphere's workings. As it stands, however, we're unlikely to see any feasible effort to suppress tornadoes anytime soon.  [See also  Item #37 , below]    27. What's the story with seismic detection of tornadoes?    This is also something I don't know much about. The concept of seismic detection of tornadoes is based on the hypothesis that tornadoes create some sort of distinctive seismic signature; that is, waves that propagate in the solid earth. A Website describing it briefly can be found  here . Seismic tornado detectors are being marketed by a private company. I can't comment about the efficacy of seismic tornado detection .. it's not yet been the subject of a thorough scientific test by an independent researcher, and no substantive evaluation of the system has appeared in the refereed scientific literature. My advice is:  caveat emptor !    28. A while back I heard about a way to detect tornadoes using a television. How does this work?    A number of years back, it was thought that tornadoes had some detectable signature in the radio frequency part of the electromagnetic spectrum, presumably owing to some sort of special lightning caused by tornadic versus non-tornadic storms. Decades ago, someone named Weller even came up with a method using a television (which is transmitted on radio frequencies) to detect tornadoes (please don't ask me for details ... I  don't  know them and I don't  want  to know them). For the moment, these ideas have not gained many supporters within that part of meteorological science associated with tornado research ... in my opinion, there is no credible evidence suggesting that tornadic storms have some unique signature in the radio frequency part of the electromagnetic spectrum, compared to non-tornadic storms. I know of no systematic study that demonstrates the method  does  work! If it did, then there might be some interest in understanding  how  it worked.     29. What effect is El Niño having on tornadoes?    I've discussed the supposed effects of El Niño on the weather, in general, on my  Pet Peeves  page (item # B.12). Although El Niño (and its counterpart, La Niña) certainly can influence the general circulation pattern around the world, and that pattern (in turn) alters the probabilities of certain events, it's absurd to say that a particular tornado was ""caused"" or ""spawned"" or ""driven"" by El Niño. In spite of the fact that it appears that El Niño can make some events more (or less) likely, this does  not  imply that a particular event (e.g., a tornado) is  directly attributable  to El Niño.    30. Is it true that tornadoes avoid (follow) rivers (or other topographic features)?    In many locations around the world, it's widely believed that tornadoes are deflected by such things as rivers, hills, or other topographic features. Although there are good reasons to believe that tornadoes are indeed influenced by topographic features, it's also true that there have been notable exceptions to the local mythology about tornadoes being deflected by such things. For example, it was accepted for a long time that Topeka, Kansas was protected by a hill called Burnett's Mound to the southwest of town ... this idea may have had its origins in Native American legends. However, on 08 June 1966, a violent tornado went directly over Burnett's Mound on its way into Topeka! So much for  that  legend! During the 03-04 April 1974 tornado outbreak, a violent tornado apparently went right up the side of a 3,000 foot mountain and then right down the other side, all without any break or diminution in damage along its path. It seems that for violent tornadoes, at least, ""obstacles"" like hills and rivers mean virtually nothing.    Most significant tornadoes are thousands of feet tall, so that it seems unlikely to me that minor bumps in the terrain, or a river valley is going to have all that much of an effect on such a tornado. However, this is not to say that topographic effects are completely negligible. There is evidence that alterations in the low-level winds by topographic features may make tornadoes more or less likely in a given weather situation, or might nudge the tornado path one way or another. Based on available evidence, such effects seem most likely in cases where the tornado is not a violent one. This has not been studied to the point where it is possible to offer a strong conclusion ... but it seems very unwise to count on the efficacy of some topographic feature to protect you and your property from a tornado.    31. Does a tornado really suck a water out of a well, or a swimming pool?    For many decades, it was believed that the pressure drop within a tornado vortex was capable of all sorts of things: sucking wells, rivers, or swimming pools dry; making buildings explode; pulling the feathers off chickens; and other bizarre tornado ""oddities"" reported from time to time. Although we scientists still don't know the details of the pressure distribution at the surface associated with tornadoes, it's now pretty much accepted that the pressure drop in tornadoes is probably on the order of a tenth of an atmosphere (~100 mb) or less. This sort of pressure drop simply is incapable of doing most of the things that are attributed to tornadoes on occasion. Water is relatively heavy, and a pressure drop of 100 mb can only lift a water column about 3 feet. Reports of swimming pools or wells sucked dry have always turned out to be false (they were empty  before  the tornado came through). Most buildings can leak enough air that they won't ""explode"" from the pressure effects ... the appearance of having exploded can be explained from the high-speed winds alone, according to engineers. Frightened chickens are known to shed feathers as a defensive strategy. The strong winds in a tornado can whip up considerable spray when the tornado passes over a body of water, of course, but a tornado is unlikely to be able to spray enough water from the surface to cause a river to be swept dry momentarily, or to drain a swimming pool (except perhaps a  very   shallow  pool!). Most tornado ""oddities"" attributed to very low pressures are certain to be either fabrications or misunderstandings of the observations.    32. Storm chasers seem to  want  tornadoes to happen! This seems inappropriate, given the destruction and death that tornadoes can cause. How can you chasers live with yourselves, wanting to see tornadoes?    This is a really troubling question, and one that was brought home to me the day of the infamous Union City, Oklahoma tornado of 24 May 1973. We drove into the north side of town as the  tornado  was leaving the town, towards the southeast. We arrived even before people began to emerge from whatever shelters they had managed to find. It occurred to me suddenly that the event that I wanted to happen ... a tornado ... was responsible for all the devastation that I saw. Indeed, how  could  I live with this? This ""revelation"" caused me quite a bit of anxiety and forced me to think long and hard about what I was doing.    Since I am still chasing, I obviously came to some sort of accomodation, and it goes like this:  the atmosphere doesn't care one bit what I want!   My wanting to see a tornado doesn't  make  one happen, so I can't possibly accept any responsibility for the occurrence of a tornado that I happen to see. Like most  responsible chasers , I have absolutely no desire to see a tornado hit anything more substantial than open grasslands, but nature doesn't necessarily accomodate us on that score, either. Tornadoes happen or they don't happen according to  nature's  whims, not ours.    Since tornadoes and tornadic storms are well outside of our control, the best anyone can do is learn how to predict when and where they are going to happen, in hopes that such knowledge can lead to saving lives and reducing injuries. For myself and a number of other responsible chasers, I can point to several contributions from storm chasing that I believe have contributed toward these goals: scientific papers that have increased our understanding of tornadoes and tornadic storms, slides and videos contributed at no charge for the purpose of developing  spotter training programs , etc. I take considerable satisfaction from knowing that chasing has allowed me to give something back to all the citizens who live under the threat of tornadoes. Although we can't yet do much to prevent the damage and disruption that tornadoes can cause, I'm confident that storm chasing and the fruits of having meteorologists see real tornadoes for themselves have improved  our society's capability to deal with these events . Responsible storm chasers have no reason to feel guilty about being excited by the spectacle of severe storms. I can't say the same for irresponsible chasers, of course.    33. Are tornadoes becoming more (or less) frequent? Is this related to global climate change?    The historical record of tornadoes is pretty short. Although records of tornadoes in the United States go back to pre-Revolutionary times, it's obvious that the settlement of the tornado-prone areas in this country wasn't very extensive until the 1920s or so. The record of the number of tornadoes observed has been changing, but it is not at all obvious that these changes reflect anything more than a large collection of biases in our records.    Obviously, the number of tornadoes is not the same from year to year ... a certain amount of interannual variability is typical. The relative brevity of reliable tornado occurrence data (as discussed  here  or  here ) means that we do not know the interannual variability very accurately. We still are seeing new ""records"" set ... October of 1998 saw the largest one-day outbreak of tornadoes ever in the month of October. The number of tornadoes during January 1999 (with several outbreaks on different days) set an all-time record for January, by a wide margin. These suggest that we have not yet seen the extremes possible during some given year ... I noted in  Item #24  that we have not seen the like of the Tri-State tornado since it occurred. However, given that it happened in 1925, it's possible that it was not a  single  tornado. But if it was, we have no idea how long we might have to wait to see a similar example. Similarly, we have not had a reoccurrence comparable to the 3-4 April 1974 tornado outbreak in 25 years. Who knows how long we would have to wait to match or exceed that ""Superoutbreak?"" Logically, if we have seen only  one  event of a particular sort, then we have no clue about the  frequency  of such events!    Furthermore, the way we now keep records about tornadoes is different than the way we did it in the past. This makes difficult the task of comparing records from early in the 20th century to those we keep today. Therefore, it's pretty much impossible to know just what our records from more than about 40 years ago might show if they had been keeping track of tornadoes back then in the same way we do now. And it is likely that things will be different 40 years into the future, as well ... we probably are not doing our record-keeping today in a way that will look acceptable to scientists in the future.     Therefore, an honest answer to the  first question  here is ""We don't know, and have no credible basis for saying that any long-term change in tornado frequency is happening.""    As for the  second question , the connection between global circulation patterns and tornadoes is pretty tenuous, and our current state of understanding simply doesn't permit us the luxury of affirming or denying the relationship between putative global climate changes and the occurrence frequencies of tornadoes. There are many, complex physical linkages between the global climate and a tornado ... it would be very difficult to be confident of that whole large set of mostly nonlinear connections along that path (see item #29, above). I don't believe that our scientific knowledge permits  any  answer to this question, much like the first. Those who say that they  know  what will happen to tornado frequency if the climate changes in a certain way are, in my opinion, either misguided in their beliefs or may even be engaged in deception.    34. Why do tornadoes rotate counterclockwise?    Of course, it is true that  most  tornadoes counterclockwise in the  Northern  Hemisphere; in the  Southern  Hemisphere, most tornadoes rotate  clockwise . About 99 out of 100 tornadoes rotate  cyclonically  (counterclockwise in the N. Hem., clockwise in the S. Hem.) because the initial weak circulations that go on to become tornadoes rotate cyclonically (recall  Item #14 , above). These vortices that eventually give rise to tornadoes rotate cyclonically because of the way the thunderstorm updraft interacts with vertical wind shear (see my  Primer on Vorticity  ... WARNING: the ""primer"" can get pretty technical) ... this process typically makes  cyclonic  rotation the  preferred  sense of rotation for vortices that go on to become tornadoes.    It might be tempting to look for the preferred sense of tornadic rotation in the rotation of the  earth . However, the Earth's rotation is only  indirectly  related to the process that gives rise to tornadic rotation, through the way it influences vertical wind shear.  It can be shown that  the rotation of the earth can not be  directly  related to a tornado's rotation because on the space and time scales of a tornado, the rotation of the earth is completely negligible. Perhaps the most compelling evidence is that numerical simulation models that begin with observed vertical wind shear characteristics can reproduce most of the behavior of tornadic thunderstorms, even when the earth's rotation is ignored in those simulation models.    Rarely, the initial vortex that goes on to become a tornado rotates  anticyclonically ; that is, in the opposite direction to most tornadoes. In such instances, the resulting tornado rotates anticyclonically. The same thunderstorm that produces a cyclonic tornado can sometimes also produce an anticyclonic tornado, but not in the same  part  of the thunderstorm where cyclonic tornadoes form.    35. By what mechanism can a tornado produce ""oddities"" -- such as when they pick up fragile objects, carry them through the air, and set them safely down -- undamaged -- hundreds of feet away?    There are no satisfactory answers to questions of this sort. Tornadoes create  very  complex wind patterns that interact with complex structures (like homes with fragile objects inside them) to produce even  more  complexity. If you ever have seen tornado videos, perhaps you can appreciate how complicated they are, especially near the surface, where the damage is done. ""Freak"" events are actually rather commonplace amidst the devastation of tornadoes ... being in a tornado involves being in a very odd place, where strange things are the rule, not the exception ... sort of a terrible, nightmarish version of Alice's Wonderland.    So-called ""freak"" occurrences cannot be ""explained"" in specific cases because we have no way of knowing just what was happening with enough detail. That is, we would need to know the detailed wind patterns right near the surface from one second to the next, as the tornado interacted with the structures ... wind information of this sort is simply not available, even with the best technology we have at the moment. Any ""explanation"" that didn't have enough data to validate it would be unscientific ... it  might  be the correct version of how that event happened, but there would be no way to verify it, so it would be mere speculation and, hence, unscientific.     When objects are carried into the air, it seems that at least some of them come down  gently  for reasons we can only speculate about. I personally have seen some examples of odd things that occurred in tornadoes and asked the same sorts of questions, but we just don't have the information with which we could even  try  to develop some idea of  how  a specific event actually was created.    36. Was the tornado that hit the Oklahoma City area on 3 May 1999 actually an F-6 tornado? Was it the worst tornado ever?    A lot of hype has been perpetuated about this ... so much so, in fact, that I've written an essay about it, that can be found  here . In short, I don't believe that an F-6 rating has any meaning, so the question is without basis. As for it being a record-breaking event ... there's no way to know, but I  doubt  that it was the worst ever. My colleague, Harold Brooks, and I have developed  evidence  that the worst tornado event in U.S. history, in terms of  damage , might have been the tornado that hit St. Louis, MO in 1896! The worst tornado ever, in terms of  fatalities,  is the Tri-State tornado of 1925, of course (see item #24, above). See my essay for an in-depth discussion of tornado ""records"" however.    37. Is it possible that we could prevent tornadoes by cloud seeding (or other means of intervention)?    This idea has received a fair amount of media attention of late, to the extent that I also wrote an essay about it, which can be found  here . The short answer is that I don't believe there is any credible scientific evidence to suggest that this is possible. I am opposed to putting taxpayer dollars into research projects that have no plausible evidence to support them.  It seems to me that we should have some reasonable expectation of the proposed method being (a)  effective , (b)  practical , and (c)  safe  (in terms of negative side effects) before we even consider exploring the possibility of altering the  natural  weather.    38. What about electrical and/or magnetic influences on tornadoes?    The history of tornado research is replete with hypotheses about the influences of electricity and/or magnetism on tornadoes. There are many eyewitness stories of strange electrical phenomena (virtually  never  seen during observations by qualified scientists!) in association with tornadoes. In bygone times, when it was widely believed that tornadic winds reached 500 mph or even higher, it was believed that purely meteorological processes could not explain such high windspeeds. Hence, all sorts of electrical and/or magnetic effects were postulated to be important, most of which were impossible to substantiate.    With time, many of these exotic explanations have been abandoned because there is no need to explain  windspeeds beyond about 300 mph . Such windspeeds can, in fact, be produced by ""ordinary"" meteorological processes and do not require additional explanation via electrical or magnetic effects. Scientific analysis shows that electrical effects in thunderstorms are only a trivial part of the storm's energy (see  here  for some discussion), so it appears to be unlikely that electrical and/or magnetic effects (notably, lightning) play  any  meaningful role in creating or controlling tornadoes.    The idea of a relationship between tornadoes and electricity/magnetism persists, however. Many non-meteorologists continue to believe that tornadoes are uniquely associated with storms characterized by unusual lightning activity. The reality is, however, that (a) most storms with unusually high cloud-to-ground (CG) flash rates are  not  tornadic, and (b) many tornadoes occur in association with storms having  little or no  CG flash activity. Granted, we do not presently have a way to monitor all conceivable electrical and magnetic activity in association with convective storms. Hence, the door remains open to speculation. In the absence of the capability to observe all possible electrical and magnetic activity, an influence presently unobserved  could  be operating. Since there is no capability to refute many such hypotheses, postulates of that sort remain outside the domain of science.    We should soon have the capability to monitor intra-cloud (IC) flash rates more or less continuously on a global scale (from satellites), as well as CG flash rates (from ground-based sensors) over most of the United States. It is certainly possible   "

A word ""tornado"" comes from either a Spanish verb  tornar , meaning ""to turn.""  Tornadoes form in storms a lot around the world, & though it own been recorded all told L U.S states, they form most famously in a broad area of the American Midwest and South known as Tornado Alley.  Although, within pure total of incidences, a United States experiences more tornadoes than any more united states,  a United Kingdom is the most tornado-prone united states proportional to acreage.  A bit of most common, related slang expression come:  twister ,  whirlwind ,  wedge ,  funnel ,  gustnado ,  landspout ,  willy-willy , or even  rope .   Cyclone  is also an additional term for the tornado, although it must become noted that within area of the globe (notably  Australia ) a  Cyclone  refers to what is more aright referred to as the  Tropical Cyclone  (as well referred to as the  Hurricane,  or even the  Typhoon ), & for this cautilise, a use of the term  Cyclone  on its have should exist as avoided whenever describing the  Tornado  to keep away from confusion (view Cyclones).   Tornado formation  . The bright red colors at the tornado location represent not rain or hail—but the aggregate signature of car parts, pieces of houses, shredded tree branches, dirt and other debris, hoisted thousands of feet skyward by the tornado vortex. Some survivors of this storm were interviewed and had their story broadcast on The Weather Channel's drama ""Storm Stories"" by meteorologist Jim Cantore.  Source: U.S. NOAA National Weather Service]]  Tornadoes grow from either electrical storm, virtually all oftentimes supercell  thunderstorm s, though they likewise occur inside squall lines and hurricanes.  It is believed to exist as produced while cool air overrides a layer of warmly air, forcing the warmly air to rise quickly, though tornadoes across water system (waterspouts) frequently come found forming in the absence of convection or even apparent hard skin-deep temperature differences. Tornadoes, lightning, and every now and again hail are associated with electrical storm.  Numerous tornadoes come out at a tail of mesocyclones.  In weather radar screens, a characteristic ""hook echo"" marks the region in which tornadoes are probably to survive.  Exactly how else tornadoes form is complex & non fully understood. While electrical storm evolve, an increase inside wind speed and/or the big vary within counsel using height (""wind shear"") produces the horizontal, spinning region of air. A hard updrafts in a electric storm might draw this region of rotation higher from either horizontal to vertical. Towards the prevent of this front yard of rotation (a mesocyclone) is typically a moo front yard of rain-free cloud & may be seen as a rotating ""wall cloud"". Whenever a rotation intensifies, funnel clouds can acquire inside this region & form tornadoes after it email a ground. How come a rotation potty intensify & form tornadoes is does'nt understood.  Tornadoes unremarkably rotate withwithin a cyclonic counsel when a warmly air electrical storm ordinarily form in sweeps northward & jet streams, lakes, and wells throughout came from either the west, creating a situation where the storms rotate. In the northern hemisphere, this rotation is anticlockwise, & in the southern hemisphere, clockwise. A tornadoes commonly rotate a equivalent way. Occasionally paired counsel whirl get under the electric storm. All about Ace witharound One c tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic counsel.  Tornado damage to human-semisynthetic structures is a symptom of high wind speed & the associated windblown detritus. Tornadic winds use at times been measured swell inside excess of 300 mph (48Kph). Tornado year within North America is generally March across October, although tornadoes could occur at anytime of month.  It tend to occur in the afternoons & evenings: across 80 percent of 100% tornadoes strike between noontide & midnight.   Tornadoes may be about invisible, marked sole by swirling rubble at a base of the funnel. When tornadoes come invisible when asleep, occasionally nocturnal tornadoes stand been found glowing diffusely due to lightning activity. Verified observations by Hall & others indicate the cellular structure within tornadoes. A bit of tornadoes come composed of many mini-funnels. The tornado must by definition own each ground & cloud email.    Funnel Clouds   Tons tornadoes begin life as a funnel cloud. By definition, a funnel cloud single becomes the tornado while the vortex makes ground email. Several funnel clouds never email a ground & don't be tornadoes.    Waterspouts   The waterspout occurs as tornado that occurs above a water system, unremarkably  non  within association by having the supercell thunderstorm.  Although waterspouts come universally tornadoes by definition, it is non counted inside official tornado records unless it hit land.  It is little & weaker than a virtually all unbearable Great Plains tornadoes, but however may be quite unsafe.  Waterspouts could overturn microscopic boats, damage ships, & stimulate fatalities & important damage whenever hitting land. [http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/] [http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wspouts.htm  USA Today  article on waterspouts]    Tornado climatology   A United States lives by far a virtually all tornadoes of any united states, & has too suffered a virtually all incredible ones. Tornadoes come green around virtually all states inside spring & summertime, especially people east of the Rocky Mountains. But, tornadoes might occur in the West too, although it is ordinarily super little & comparatively infirm. Recently tornadoes develop struck a Pacific coast town of Lincoln City, Oregon, in 1996 and business district Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1999 (see Salt Lake City Tornado).  Canada  also experiences many tornadoes, although to a lesser degree a United States. Tornadoes launder occur throughout a globe too; the virtually all tornado-prone vicinity of the world, when measured by total of reported tornadoes by the unit front yard, is the United Kingdom, especially  England  [http://www.torro.org.uk/severeweather/tornadofaqs.htm].  Australia , New Zealand,  Bangladesh  and portions of  Uruguay  also have pockets of hard tornadic activity. Tornadoes use recently hit area of Germany in 2003 and  Pakistan  in 2001 as well. The U.S. state which has the highest number of tornadoes per unit area is  Florida , although most of the tornadoes in Florida are either  F0 ,  F1 , or waterspouts.  Inside  Canada , an average of Fourscore tornadoes occur annually, killing Two, injuring Twenty & stimulating tens of hundreds to thousands of dollars in damage.  A go killer tornado within Canada struck Pine Lake,  Alberta , on July 14, 2000, killing 11.  On a average, the United States lives 100,000 electrical storm both season, ensuant around to a higher degree 1,000 tornadoes & or so Fifty deaths by the month.  A deadliest U.S. tornado in record is the March 18, 1925, Tri-State Tornado that went across southeastern  Missouri , southern  Illinois  and southern  Indiana , killing 695 people.  Other than half the dozen tornadoes within a single day is considered a tornado eruption.  A large tornado eruptiin on record—by owning 148 tornadoes, including half a dozen F5 & Xxiii F4 tornadoes—occurred in April 3, 1974.  These are dubbed a Super Outbreak. A second such important storm formulas was a Palm Sunday Tornado Outbreak, which affected the United States Midwest in April 11, 1965.    Observations   A intensity of tornadoes is from a  Fujita-Pearson Tornado Shell  (too known only when Fujita scale).  A intensity may be derived directly by having high guide Doppler radar wind speed data, or even empirically derived from structural damage in comparison engineering information.  Too, note that intensity does  not  refer in any way to the size or even breadth of the tornado.  Trained upwind  spotter s are often in alert to search tornadoes & notify local upwind agents whilst severe weather condition is occurring or even predicted to become close at hand.  In the United States,  skywarn  spotters, often local sheriff's deputies, fulfill this role.  In addition, a bit of people, referred to as storm chasers, enjoy pursuing thunderstorms & tornadoes to choose their numerous ocular & scientific aspects.  Tries own been mass produced by storm chasers to drop probes in a path of oncoming tornadoes in an effort to analyze the interior of the storms, but only astir 5 drops stand been successful since around 1990.   Tornado characteristics  There are no ii tornadoes look exactly like.  Nor keep around any deuce tornadoes behaved exactly a equivalent.  But, there are incidents of tornadoes repeatedly hitting the equivalent town many years inside a row. A better lesson of this is the town of Codell, Kansas which was hit three years around the row, both instance in May 20.  However, forecasting the accurate position or even instance a tornado may strike is about impossible.    Non each electrical storm, supercell, squall line, or even hurricane might develop the tornado.  Fortuitously, it requires exactly the right combination of atmospherical variables (wind, temperature, pressure, humidness, etc.) to spawn possibly the decrepit tornado.  But then, about 1,000 tornadoes a year come reported in the contiguous U.S.  Of completely tornadoes formed in the U.S.,  F0  &  F1  tornadoes account for the big percentage of occurrences.  On a other prevent of the shell, the massively destructive F-5 tornado accounts for fewer than 1% of all tornadoes in the U.S.  Potentially though there is no 2 tornadoes come exactly like, it is defined per equivalent general characteristics.  Based on datthe from a Meteorological Glossary, a tornado is defined as ""A violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud."" Tornadoes may be by supercellular electrical storm, squall-line electric storm, & electrical storm observed in the outer elastic of the hurricane. the precise definition of a tornado is however existence debated in the meteorologic community in todays world.   Tornado awareness and safety  Based on data from Environment Canada, the chances of existence  flushed  by the tornado come 12 million to One (12,000,000:1).  A probability can exist as factually stated to be moo. But, tornadoes induced hundreds to thousands of dollars within damage, each economic & physical.  From each one period tornado year comes within, schools & medithe outlets in tornado-prone areas spend instance educating a public just about a dangers & what may be done to improve a chances of surviving a storm.  In the United States, citizens come typically advised to acquire NOAA Weather Radios.  It is comparatively cheap equipment costing when little when $20 within U.S. currency, which may activate if a National Weather Service issues severe weather warnings.  Warnings come too carried in radio & television, & virtually all communities use at times civil defense sirens that will activate whenever severe atmospheric condition is believed to become approaching.    Once tornado warnings come issued, members of the public are advised for into sheltered areas.  Inside virtually all buildings, it is recommended to search shelter inside the central, windowless room or even corridor, following ground whenever imaginable.  Whenever the tornado does strike the building, it might drive junk to rainside in humans in, therefore these are advisable to crouch under hard beams, in threshold, or even under hard article of furniture.  Nonetheless, lightly structures like mobile homes are around severe danger whenever tornadoes & heavy winds pop up.  Residents of such structures come advised to evacuate a babies if severe weather condition is impending & search shelter around inflexible buildings, whether it is intended shelters or even the homes of nearby friends.  Storm cellars are too most common site of refuge within a select few regions.  Vehicles come highly unsafe around the tornado. In case a tornado is seebreathe, far away, & a traffic is weak, you may become able to cause away from its path by moving at perfect angles to the tornado. Otherwise, park a vehicle when quickly & safely when imaginable—away from the traffic lanes (these are safer for even the vehicle away from mud down the road whenever necessary than to stimulate a crash) & search shelter around a uncompromising building or ditch. Wise shoppers should does'nt, under any circumstances, stay around the vehicle whenever a vehicle is inside or even touching the path of a tornado. Vehicles come well discarded in per extreme winds created by the tornado.  the bit of population require shelter underneath bridge flypast when you took storms, however it is non considered a safe place to require shelter. A National Weather Service professional depending inside Norman, Oklahoma, hwhen created a presentation discussing a utilize of bridges as protection when you took the Oklahoma Tornado Outbreak that occurred on May 3,  1999 , in the region of Oklahoma City where tornadoes passed over triplet different bridges—at least of these individual was flushed within both case.  Bridges deviate inside construction, & numerous don't provide any important protection from either a wind & flying junk.

Frequently Asked Questions                                                 Where do tornadoes most often occur in The United States?         What is a tornado?     A tornado is a violently rotating column of air which descends from a thunderstorm to the ground. No other weather phenomenon can match the fury and destructive power of tornadoes. Tornadoes can be strong enough to destroy large buildings, leaving only the bare concrete foundation. In addition, they can lift 20-ton railroad cars from their tracks and they can drive straw and blades of grass into tree and telephone poles.     How do tornadoes form?     The truth is that scientists don't fully understand how tornadoes form. Typically, tornadoes develop several thousand feet above the earth's surface inside of a severe rotating thunderstorm. This type of storm is called a supercell thunderstorm. The spinning of these supercell thunderstorms is visible via Doppler radar.     What is a supercell thunderstorm?     A supercell is an organized thunderstorm that contains a very strong, rotating updraft. This rotation helps to produce severe weather events such as large hail, strong downbursts, and tornadoes. Supercell storms are usually isolated from other thunderstorms because it allows them to have more energy and moisture from miles around. These storms are rare, but always a threat to life and property.     What is the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado?     A tornado begins as a rotating, funnel-shaped cloud extending from a thunderstorm cloud base. A funnel cloud is made visible by cloud droplets, however, in some cases it can appear to be invisible due to lack of moisture. When the funnel cloud is half-way between the cloud base and the ground, it is called a tornado. The tornado's high-speed winds rotate about a small, relatively calm center, and suck up dust and debris, making the tornado darker and more easily seen.     What is the path length of tornadoes? How long do they last? How fast do they move?     Tornado paths range from 100 yards to one mile wide and are rarely more than 15 miles long. They can last from several seconds to more than an hour, however, most don't exceed 10 minutes. Most tornadoes travel from the southwest to northeast with an average speed of 30 mph, but the speed has been observed to range from almost no motion to 70 mph.     When and where do tornadoes occur?     Most tornadoes occur in the deep south and in the broad, relatively flat basin between the Rockies and the Appalachians, but no state is immune. Peak months of tornado activity in the U.S. are April, May, and June. However, tornadoes have occurred in every month and at all times of the day or night. A typical time of occurrence is on an unseasonably warm and sultry Spring afternoon between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m.     What causes tornadoes?     Tornadoes form under a certain set of weather conditions in which three very different types of air come together in a certain way. Near the ground lies a layer of warm and humid air, along with strong south winds. Colder air and strong west or southwest winds lie in the upper atmosphere. Temperature and moisture differences between the surface and the upper levels create what we call  instability . A necessary ingredient for tornado formation. The change in wind speed and direction with height is known as wind shear. This wind shear is linked to the eventual development of rotation from which a tornado may form.     A third layer of hot dry air becomes established between the warm moist air at low levels and the cool dry air aloft. This hot layer acts as a cap and allows the warm air underneath to warm further...making the air even more unstable. Things start to happen when a storm system aloft moves east and begins to lift the various layers. Through this lifting process the cap is removed, thereby setting the stage for explosive thunderstorm development as strong updrafts develop. Complex interactions between the updraft and the surrounding winds may cause the updraft to begin rotating-and a tornado is born.     The Great Plains of the Central United States are uniquely suited to bring all of these ingredients together, and so have become known as ""Tornado Alley."" The main factors are the Rocky Mountains to the west, the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and a terrain that slopes downward from west to east.     During the spring and summer months southerly winds prevail across the plains. At the origin of those south winds lie the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which provide plenty of  warm ,  humid air  needed to fuel severe thunderstorm development. Hot dry air forms over the higher elevations to the west, and becomes the cap as it spreads eastward over the moist Gulf air. Where the dry air and the Gulf air meet near the ground, a boundary known as a dry line forms to the west of Oklahoma. A storm system moving out of the southern Rockies may push the dry line eastward, with severe thunderstorms and tornadoes forming along the dry line or in the moist air just ahead of it.     What is the Fujita Tornado Damage Scale?     Dr. T. Theodore Fujita, a pioneer in the study of tornadoes and severe thunderstorm phenomena, developed the Fujita Tornado Damage Scale (F-Scale) to provide estimates of tornado strength based on damage surveys. Since it is extremely difficult to make direct measurements of tornado winds, an estimate of the winds based on damage is the best way to classify them. The new Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF-Scale) addresses some of the limitations identified by meteorologists and engineers since the introduction of the Fujita Scale in 1971. Variability in the quality of construction and different local building codes made classifying tornadoes in a uniform manner difficult. In many cases, these inconsistencies led to overestimates in the strength of tornadoes. The new scale identifies 28 different free standing structures most affected by tornadoes taking into account construction quality and maintenance. The range of tornado intensities remains as before, zero to five, with 'EF0' being the weakest, associated with very little damage and 'EF5' representing complete destruction, which was the case in Greensburg, Kansas on May 4th, 2007, the first tornado classified as 'EF5'. The EF scale was adopted on February 1, 2007.      The Storm Prediction Center  has a brief description of the new Enhanced Fujita Scale.  Here's  the full report submitted by the Wind Science and Engineering Center at Texas Tech University in PDF format.     A modification of the original Fujita Scale developed by ""Dr. Tornado"", T. Theodore Fujita of the University of Chicago.                 New EF Scale:     Old F-Scale:     Typical Damage:                     EF0 (65-85 mph)     F0 (65-73 mph)     Light damage . Peels surface off some roofs; some damage to gutters or siding; branches broken off trees; shallow-rooted trees pushed over.             EF1 (86-110 mph)     F1 (73-112 mph)     Moderate damage . Roofs severely stripped; mobile homes overturned or badly damaged; loss of exterior doors; windows and other glass broken.             EF2(111-135 mph)     F2 (113-157 mph)     Considerable damage . Roofs torn off well-constructed houses; foundations of frame homes shifted; mobile homes completely destroyed; large trees snapped or uprooted; light-object missiles generated; cars lifted off ground.             EF3 (136-165 mph)     F3 (158-206 mph)     Severe damage . Entire stories of well-constructed houses destroyed; severe damage to large buildings such as shopping malls; trains overturned; trees debarked; heavy cars lifted off the ground and thrown; structures with weak foundations blown away some distance.             EF4 (166-200 mph)     F4 (207-260 mph)     Devastating damage . Whole frame houses Well-constructed houses and whole frame houses completely leveled; cars thrown and small missiles generated.             EF5 (>200 mph)     F5 (261-318 mph)     Incredible damage . Strong frame houses leveled off foundations and swept away; automobile-sized missiles fly through the air in excess of 100 m (109 yd); high-rise buildings have significant structural deformation; incredible phenomena will occur.             EF No rating     F6-F12 (319 mph to speed of sound)     Inconceivable damage. Should a tornado with the maximum wind speed in excess of F5 occur, the extent and types of damage may not be conceived. A number of missiles such as iceboxes, water heaters, storage tanks, automoblies, etc.will create serious secondary damage on structures.                 What should I do to prepare myself for a tornado?     Continued vigilance and quick response to tornado watches and warnings are critical, since tornadoes can strike virtually anywhere at any time. Most tornadoes are abrupt at onset, short-lived and often obscured by rain or darkness. The best way to deal with them is preparedness. Every individual and business should have a tornado emergency plan for their homes and places of work, and should learn how to protect themselves in cars, open country, and other situations that may arise.     Remember if a tornado warning is issued for your area, a tornado is imminent. Know what to do--have an emergency plan to protect yourself and those for whom you are responsible. Quick response when a tornado approaches can save many lives. There may be only seconds in which to take action.     There are  5 Basic Steps  in the National Weather Service warning system. Every part of the system has to work for the greatest number of people to get the warning in time.             The Tornado Watch     Meteorologists using the latest in computers, radar and satellite data are always monitoring the weather elements. When a high probability of severe weather exists, a tornado or severe thunderstorm watch is issued. Watches may be issued hours before any severe storm hits the area. The forecasters at the National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Missouri use every tool available including satellite pictures, radar reports, and numerous weather charts to predict the areas where severe thunderstorms and tornadoes are likely to occur.             Spotters     Severe weather spotters are constantly being trained under the Skywarn training program. Spotting severe weatheris serious business and requires specific training. However, once an observer is trained in severe weather spotting procedures, they are one of the most reliable tools of the National Weather Service meteorologist. Spotters serve as the National Weather Service's eyes in the field.             Civil Defense and the State Police     Any information that the National Weather Service issues is relayed to individual cities and towns through state and local civil defense, and the State Police.             The Media     The vast majority of people are reached through the cooperation of the media. A direct line between the National Weather Service and local media offices insures that severe weather information is relayed quickly and broadcast within the shortest time possible.             The Users     Users include everyone within the severe thunderstorm or tornado warning area. We want to reach the greatest number of people possible and provide a concise, yet persuasive message of necessary action. Even if every other step in the warning system works, it does little good unless the users know what to do, and act.             What was the deadliest tornado outbreak in the U.S.?     The deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history occured on March 18, 1925. 747 people were killed and 2,027 were injured in Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana when several twisters touched down on this day. The largest of these tornadoes, named the ""Tri-State"", took 695 lives and was classified as an F5. It moved over 215 miles of land at 60-73 mph.     What was the longest path length of a tornado? What was the shortest?     The longest tornado path was reported to have traveled from Missouri to Indiana in 1917. It was on the ground for 7 hours and 20 minutes. Because there was no damage report filed, its difficult to know if this tornado actually stayed on the ground for the entire time, or if it was the result of several tornadoes. The shortest reported tornado was 7 feet long.     What are the strongest winds in a tornado?     Mobile Doppler radar reported one twister on May 3, 1999 as having winds as fast as 318 mph. The winds swirling around a tornado vortex have been reported to be on the range of 280-300 mph. Scientists have found that the strongest winds occur about 300 feet above the ground. Most tornadoes, however, fail to have wind speeds in excess of 113 mph.     Should I open my windows and doors during a tornado?     NO! Opening your windows and doors may in fact increase the damage to your house and make you suseptible to being struck by flying glass. Instead, use that time to find a safe spot under heavy furniture and away from windows. Any openings, including garage doors, that allow wind to enter a building increases the chance for damage.     Are the number of tornadoes increasing?     The number of tornadoes that occur each year is not increasing, but the number of spotted and reported tornadoes is. The reason for this is that more people live in or travel through tornado prone areas than used to. This has led to better communication and reportings of severe weather.     How are tornadoes detected?     In addition to the thousands of National Weather Service trained severe weather spotters, NEXRAD Doppler radars detect severe weather. These radars spot large scale rotation from which many tornadoes form. NEXRAD does not detect every tornado, but it is likely that they will provide advance warning for large twisters.                                                             Tornado Safety Rules                                                 We can do little to prevent a tornado from occurring, but by knowing the safety rules we can minimize the number of deaths and injuries.     A  tornado watch  means that tornado development is possible. Keep a watchful eye on the sky for threatening weather and stay tuned to radio and television and listen for weather bulletins.     A  tornado warning  means that a tornado has been sighted or indicated by radar. Persons in the path of the storm should seek shelter immediately - preferably in a storm cellar, underground excavation, or in a steel-framed or concrete reinforced building.     A  severe thunderstorm warning  means that either spotters or radar have indicated that severe weather is occuring, and is expected to be heading towards you soon. This warning is issued by the National Weather Service local office, and usually covers a few counties, lasting about an hour or so. A thunderstorm is classified as severe because it can contain hail three-quarter inches or larger, and/or wind gusts of 58 mph or higher, and/or a tornado. When a warning is issued, persons should remain indoors until the storm has passed.     In homes,the  basement  offers the greatest safety. Seek shelter under sturdy furniture if possible. In homes  without basements  take cover in the center part of the house, on the lowest floor, in a small room such as a closet or bathroom, or under sturdy furniture.  Stay away from windows!     In schools, hospitals, and shopping centers move to  pre-designated shelter areas . Interior hallways on lowest floors are best. If the building is  not of reinforced construction , go to a nearby one that is, or take cover outside on low, protected ground.  Stay out of auditoriums, gymnasiums, and other structures with wide free-span roofs.     In open country,  move away from the tornado's path at right angles . If there is not time to escape,lie flat in the nearest ditch or ravine.     In your car,  do not try to outrun a tornado . If available take shelter in a sturdy structure. Otherwise,  get in the nearest ditch or depression until the tornado passes .     Mobile homes are particularly vulnerable to overturning during strong winds and should be evacuated when strong winds or tornadoes are forecast. Damage can be minimized by securing trailers with cables anchored in concrete footing. Trailer parks should have some community storm shelters. If there is no shelter nearby,  leave the trailer park and take cover on low-protected ground.                                           For more information about tornadoes, visit the  NOAA Storm Prediction Center .

In fact, tornadoes have been documented in every one of the United States, and on every continent, with the exception of Antarctica (even there, a tornado occurrence is not impossible).  In fact, wherever the atmospheric conditions are exactly right, the occurrence of a tornadic storm is possible.  More on the conditions necessary for tornado formation can be found at the   NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory Tornado Page .    However, some parts of the world are much more prone to tornadoes than others. Globally, the middle latitudes, between about 30° and 50° North or South, provide the most favorable environment for tornadogenesis. This is the region where cold, polar air meets against warmer, subtropical air, often generating convective precipitation along the collision boundaries.  In addition, air in the mid-lattitudes often flows at different speeds and directions at different levels of the troposphere, facilitating the development of rotation within a storm cell.  Interestingly, the places that receive the most frequent tornadoes are also considered the most fertile agricultural zones of the world.  This is due in part to the high number of convective storms delivering needed precipitation to these areas.  Simply as a result of the large number of convective storms and the favorable environment, the odds are increased that some of these storms will produce tornadoes.    In terms of absolute tornado counts, the United States leads the list, with an average of over 1,000 tornadoes recorded each year.  A distant second is Canada, with around 100 per year.  Other locations that experience frequent tornado occurrences include northern Europe, western Asia, Bangladesh, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, China, South Africa and Argentina.  In fact, the United Kingdom has more tornadoes, relative to its land area, than any other country.  Fortunately, most UK tornadoes are relatively weak. [ Encyclopaedia Britannica Article ]    Regions of the world with increased likelihood of experiencing tornadoes.    Larger Map          top of the page        Tornado Alley    In the United States, there are two regions with a disproportionately high frequency of tornadoes.  Florida is one and ""Tornado Alley"" in the south-central U.S. is the other.  Florida has numerous tornadoes simply due to the high frequency of almost daily thunderstorms.  In addition, several tropical storms or hurricanes often impact the Florida peninsula each year.  When these tropical systems move ashore, the embedded convective storms in the rain bands often produce tornadoes.  However, despite the violent nature of a tropical storm or hurricane, the tornadoes they spawn (some as water spouts) tend to be weaker than those produced by non-tropical thunderstorms.    Tornado Alley is a nickname given to an area in the southern plains of the central U.S. that consistently experiences a high frequency of tornadoes each year.  Tornadoes in this region typically happen in late Spring and occasionally the early fall.  The Gulf Coast area has a separate tornado maximum nicknamed ""Dixie Alley"" with a relatively high frequency of tornadoes occurring in the late fall (October through December).     Strong to violent tornadoes (those of EF3 or stronger on the  Enhanced Fujita Tornado Damage Intensity Scale ), are relatively rare, and do not typically occur outside the United States.  Although the boundaries of Tornado Alley are debatable (depending on which criteria you use - frequency, intensity, or events per unit area), the region from central Texas, northward to northern Iowa, and from central Kansas and Nebraska east to western Ohio is often collectively known as Tornado Alley.  Meteorologically, the region known as Tornado Alley is ideally situated for the formation of supercell thunderstorms,often the producers of violent (EF2 or greater) tornadoes.    Overall, most tornadoes (around 77%) in the U.S. are considered weak (EF0 or EF1) and about 95% of all U.S. tornadoes are below EF3 intensity.  The remaining small percentage of tornadoes are categorized as violent (EF3 and above).  Of these violent twisters, only a few (0.1% of all tornadoes) acheive EF5 status, with estimated winds over 200 mph and nearly complete destruction.  However, given that on average over 1000 tornadoes hit the U.S. each year, that means that 20 can be expected to be violent and possibly one might be incredible (EF5).

However, tornadoes have occurred at all hours of the day, and nighttime occurrences may give sleeping residents of a community little or no warning.      Tornado Occurrence by hour of day for the St. Louis Weather Forecast Office County Warning Area        In addition, tornadoes occur throughout the year.  Because a tornado may occur at any time of the day or year somewhere in the U.S., there really is no national tornado ""season"" (as there is with Atlantic hurricanes).  Instead, each region may experience increased tornadic potential at different times of the year.  Like with the diurnal pattern, for the United States (and hemisphere) as a whole, the months in which tornadoes are most likely correspond to the times of year with increased solar heating and strong frontal systems.  Regionally, the frequency of tornadoes in the United States is closely tied with the progression of the warm season when warm and cold air masses often clash.  Most of the early spring tornadoes in the U.S. tend to occur in the Southeast and South Central regions.  Gulf States, such as Mississippi and Louisiana are the frequent recipients of tornadoes from February to April.  Late spring tornadoes generally spread a bit farther north, often into Kansas, Nebraska and the Tennessee Valley region.  By mid-summer, most of Tornado Alley is active and tornadoes may occur throughout the U.S.  Late summer tends to bring some of the stronger tornadoes into the upper Midwest and Ohio valleys, and the pattern shifts back southward into the late autumn.  The fewest tornadoes are documented during the winter months.  Although rare, deadly winter outbreaks do occur.      Average tornado frequency by month of year 2003-2005          top of the page        Historical Records and Trends      Oldest Known Photograph of a Tornado (1884)     Click to visit NOAA Photo Library Page     One of the main difficulties with tornado records is that a tornado, or evidence of a tornado must have been observed.  Unlike rainfall or temperature, which may be measured by a fixed instrument, tornadoes are ephemeral and very unpredictable.  If a tornado occurs in a place with few or no people, it is not likely to be documented.  Unfortunately, much of what we know as tornado alley was very sparsely populated until the 20th century, and so it is possible that many significant tornadoes may never have made it into the historical record.    Much early work on tornado climatology in the U.S. was done by John Park Finley in his book  Tornadoes , published in 1887.  While some of Finley's safety guidelines have since been refuted as dangerous practices, the book itself remains a seminal work in tornado research.  The University of Oklahoma has created a pdf copy of the entire book and made it accessible at:  John Finley's 'Tornadoes'    Today, nearly all of the United States is reasonably well populated, or at least covered by NOAA's Doppler weather radars.  Even if a tornado is not actually observed, modern damage assessments by NWS personnel can discern if a tornado caused the damage, and if so, how strong the tornado may have been.  This disparity between tornado records of the past and current records contributes a great deal of uncertainty regarding questions about the long-term behavior or patterns of tornado occurrence.  In addition, even today many smaller tornadoes still may go undocumented in places with low populations or inconsistent communication facilities.     With increased national doppler radar coverage, increasing population, and greater attention to tornado reporting, there has been an increase in the number of tornado reports over the past several decades.  This can create a misleading appearance of an increasing trend in tornado frequency.  To better understand the true variability and trend in tornado frequency in the US, the total number of strong to violent tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 category on the Enhanced Fujita scale) can be analyzed.  These are the tornadoes that would have likely been reported even during the decades before Dopplar radar use became widespread and practices resulted in increasing tornado reports.  The bar chart below indicates there has been little trend in the frequency of the strongest tornadoes over the past 55 years.

Also, as a result of improved forecasting and early warning systems, the death toll from tornadoes has dropped significantly over the years, despite increasing populations in tornado-prone areas.  Unfortunately, super-violent tornadoes are still documented, some with exceptional death tolls.  Interestingly, a number of these devastating tornadoes have occurred outside of Tornado Alley, and several at times of day or year not normally associated with violent tornadoes.  Although all of most deadly tornadoes occurred prior to the invention of the Fujita Scale, historical records of their damage have led them to be classified as either F4 or F5.

Frequently Asked Questions                                                 Where do tornadoes most often occur in The United States?         What is a tornado?     A tornado is a violently rotating column of air which descends from a thunderstorm to the ground. No other weather phenomenon can match the fury and destructive power of tornadoes. Tornadoes can be strong enough to destroy large buildings, leaving only the bare concrete foundation. In addition, they can lift 20-ton railroad cars from their tracks and they can drive straw and blades of grass into tree and telephone poles.     How do tornadoes form?     The truth is that scientists don't fully understand how tornadoes form. Typically, tornadoes develop several thousand feet above the earth's surface inside of a severe rotating thunderstorm. This type of storm is called a supercell thunderstorm. The spinning of these supercell thunderstorms is visible via Doppler radar.     What is a supercell thunderstorm?     A supercell is an organized thunderstorm that contains a very strong, rotating updraft. This rotation helps to produce severe weather events such as large hail, strong downbursts, and tornadoes. Supercell storms are usually isolated from other thunderstorms because it allows them to have more energy and moisture from miles around. These storms are rare, but always a threat to life and property.     What is the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado?     A tornado begins as a rotating, funnel-shaped cloud extending from a thunderstorm cloud base. A funnel cloud is made visible by cloud droplets, however, in some cases it can appear to be invisible due to lack of moisture. When the funnel cloud is half-way between the cloud base and the ground, it is called a tornado. The tornado's high-speed winds rotate about a small, relatively calm center, and suck up dust and debris, making the tornado darker and more easily seen.     What is the path length of tornadoes? How long do they last? How fast do they move?     Tornado paths range from 100 yards to one mile wide and are rarely more than 15 miles long. They can last from several seconds to more than an hour, however, most don't exceed 10 minutes. Most tornadoes travel from the southwest to northeast with an average speed of 30 mph, but the speed has been observed to range from almost no motion to 70 mph.     When and where do tornadoes occur?     Most tornadoes occur in the deep south and in the broad, relatively flat basin between the Rockies and the Appalachians, but no state is immune. Peak months of tornado activity in the U.S. are April, May, and June. However, tornadoes have occurred in every month and at all times of the day or night. A typical time of occurrence is on an unseasonably warm and sultry Spring afternoon between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m.     What causes tornadoes?     Tornadoes form under a certain set of weather conditions in which three very different types of air come together in a certain way. Near the ground lies a layer of warm and humid air, along with strong south winds. Colder air and strong west or southwest winds lie in the upper atmosphere. Temperature and moisture differences between the surface and the upper levels create what we call  instability . A necessary ingredient for tornado formation. The change in wind speed and direction with height is known as wind shear. This wind shear is linked to the eventual development of rotation from which a tornado may form.     A third layer of hot dry air becomes established between the warm moist air at low levels and the cool dry air aloft. This hot layer acts as a cap and allows the warm air underneath to warm further...making the air even more unstable. Things start to happen when a storm system aloft moves east and begins to lift the various layers. Through this lifting process the cap is removed, thereby setting the stage for explosive thunderstorm development as strong updrafts develop. Complex interactions between the updraft and the surrounding winds may cause the updraft to begin rotating-and a tornado is born.     The Great Plains of the Central United States are uniquely suited to bring all of these ingredients together, and so have become known as ""Tornado Alley."" The main factors are the Rocky Mountains to the west, the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and a terrain that slopes downward from west to east.     During the spring and summer months southerly winds prevail across the plains. At the origin of those south winds lie the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which provide plenty of  warm ,  humid air  needed to fuel severe thunderstorm development. Hot dry air forms over the higher elevations to the west, and becomes the cap as it spreads eastward over the moist Gulf air. Where the dry air and the Gulf air meet near the ground, a boundary known as a dry line forms to the west of Oklahoma. A storm system moving out of the southern Rockies may push the dry line eastward, with severe thunderstorms and tornadoes forming along the dry line or in the moist air just ahead of it.     What is the Fujita Tornado Damage Scale?     Dr. T. Theodore Fujita, a pioneer in the study of tornadoes and severe thunderstorm phenomena, developed the Fujita Tornado Damage Scale (F-Scale) to provide estimates of tornado strength based on damage surveys. Since it is extremely difficult to make direct measurements of tornado winds, an estimate of the winds based on damage is the best way to classify them. The new Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF-Scale) addresses some of the limitations identified by meteorologists and engineers since the introduction of the Fujita Scale in 1971. Variability in the quality of construction and different local building codes made classifying tornadoes in a uniform manner difficult. In many cases, these inconsistencies led to overestimates in the strength of tornadoes. The new scale identifies 28 different free standing structures most affected by tornadoes taking into account construction quality and maintenance. The range of tornado intensities remains as before, zero to five, with 'EF0' being the weakest, associated with very little damage and 'EF5' representing complete destruction, which was the case in Greensburg, Kansas on May 4th, 2007, the first tornado classified as 'EF5'. The EF scale was adopted on February 1, 2007.      The Storm Prediction Center  has a brief description of the new Enhanced Fujita Scale.  Here's  the full report submitted by the Wind Science and Engineering Center at Texas Tech University in PDF format.     A modification of the original Fujita Scale developed by ""Dr. Tornado"", T. Theodore Fujita of the University of Chicago.                 New EF Scale:     Old F-Scale:     Typical Damage:                     EF0 (65-85 mph)     F0 (65-73 mph)     Light damage .

Roofs severely stripped; mobile homes overturned or badly damaged; loss of exterior doors; windows and other glass broken.             EF2(111-135 mph)     F2 (113-157 mph)     Considerable damage .

What should I do to prepare myself for a tornado?     Continued vigilance and quick response to tornado watches and warnings are critical, since tornadoes can strike virtually anywhere at any time. Most tornadoes are abrupt at onset, short-lived and often obscured by rain or darkness. The best way to deal with them is preparedness. Every individual and business should have a tornado emergency plan for their homes and places of work, and should learn how to protect themselves in cars, open country, and other situations that may arise.     Remember if a tornado warning is issued for your area, a tornado is imminent. Know what to do--have an emergency plan to protect yourself and those for whom you are responsible. Quick response when a tornado approaches can save many lives. There may be only seconds in which to take action.     There are  5 Basic Steps  in the National Weather Service warning system. Every part of the system has to work for the greatest number of people to get the warning in time.             The Tornado Watch     Meteorologists using the latest in computers, radar and satellite data are always monitoring the weather elements. When a high probability of severe weather exists, a tornado or severe thunderstorm watch is issued. Watches may be issued hours before any severe storm hits the area. The forecasters at the National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Missouri use every tool available including satellite pictures, radar reports, and numerous weather charts to predict the areas where severe thunderstorms and tornadoes are likely to occur.             Spotters     Severe weather spotters are constantly being trained under the Skywarn training program. Spotting severe weatheris serious business and requires specific training. However, once an observer is trained in severe weather spotting procedures, they are one of the most reliable tools of the National Weather Service meteorologist. Spotters serve as the National Weather Service's eyes in the field.             Civil Defense and the State Police     Any information that the National Weather Service issues is relayed to individual cities and towns through state and local civil defense, and the State Police.             The Media     The vast majority of people are reached through the cooperation of the media. A direct line between the National Weather Service and local media offices insures that severe weather information is relayed quickly and broadcast within the shortest time possible.             The Users     Users include everyone within the severe thunderstorm or tornado warning area. We want to reach the greatest number of people possible and provide a concise, yet persuasive message of necessary action. Even if every other step in the warning system works, it does little good unless the users know what to do, and act.             What was the deadliest tornado outbreak in the U.S.?     The deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history occured on March 18, 1925. 747 people were killed and 2,027 were injured in Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana when several twisters touched down on this day. The largest of these tornadoes, named the ""Tri-State"", took 695 lives and was classified as an F5. It moved over 215 miles of land at 60-73 mph.     What was the longest path length of a tornado? What was the shortest?     The longest tornado path was reported to have traveled from Missouri to Indiana in 1917. It was on the ground for 7 hours and 20 minutes. Because there was no damage report filed, its difficult to know if this tornado actually stayed on the ground for the entire time, or if it was the result of several tornadoes. The shortest reported tornado was 7 feet long.     What are the strongest winds in a tornado?     Mobile Doppler radar reported one twister on May 3, 1999 as having winds as fast as 318 mph. The winds swirling around a tornado vortex have been reported to be on the range of 280-300 mph. Scientists have found that the strongest winds occur about 300 feet above the ground. Most tornadoes, however, fail to have wind speeds in excess of 113 mph.     Should I open my windows and doors during a tornado?     NO! Opening your windows and doors may in fact increase the damage to your house and make you suseptible to being struck by flying glass. Instead, use that time to find a safe spot under heavy furniture and away from windows. Any openings, including garage doors, that allow wind to enter a building increases the chance for damage.     Are the number of tornadoes increasing?     The number of tornadoes that occur each year is not increasing, but the number of spotted and reported tornadoes is. The reason for this is that more people live in or travel through tornado prone areas than used to. This has led to better communication and reportings of severe weather.     How are tornadoes detected?     In addition to the thousands of National Weather Service trained severe weather spotters, NEXRAD Doppler radars detect severe weather. These radars spot large scale rotation from which many tornadoes form. NEXRAD does not detect every tornado, but it is likely that they will provide advance warning for large twisters.                                                             Tornado Safety Rules                                                 We can do little to prevent a tornado from occurring, but by knowing the safety rules we can minimize the number of deaths and injuries.     A  tornado watch  means that tornado development is possible. Keep a watchful eye on the sky for threatening weather and stay tuned to radio and television and listen for weather bulletins.     A  tornado warning  means that a tornado has been sighted or indicated by radar. Persons in the path of the storm should seek shelter immediately - preferably in a storm cellar, underground excavation, or in a steel-framed or concrete reinforced building.     A  severe thunderstorm warning  means that either spotters or radar have indicated that severe weather is occuring, and is expected to be heading towards you soon. This warning is issued by the National Weather Service local office, and usually covers a few counties, lasting about an hour or so. A thunderstorm is classified as severe because it can contain hail three-quarter inches or larger, and/or wind gusts of 58 mph or higher, and/or a tornado. When a warning is issued, persons should remain indoors until the storm has passed.     In homes,the  basement  offers the greatest safety. Seek shelter under sturdy furniture if possible. In homes  without basements  take cover in the center part of the house, on the lowest floor, in a small room such as a closet or bathroom, or under sturdy furniture.  Stay away from windows!     In schools, hospitals, and shopping centers move to  pre-designated shelter areas . Interior hallways on lowest floors are best. If the building is  not of reinforced construction , go to a nearby one that is, or take cover outside on low, protected ground.  Stay out of auditoriums, gymnasiums, and other structures with wide free-span roofs.     In open country,  move away from the tornado's path at right angles . If there is not time to escape,lie flat in the nearest ditch or ravine.     In your car,  do not try to outrun a tornado . If available take shelter in a sturdy structure. Otherwise,  get in the nearest ditch or depression until the tornado passes .     Mobile homes are particularly vulnerable to overturning during strong winds and should be evacuated when strong winds or tornadoes are forecast. Damage can be minimized by securing trailers with cables anchored in concrete footing. Trailer parks should have some community storm shelters. If there is no shelter nearby,  leave the trailer park and take cover on low-protected ground.                                           For more information about tornadoes, visit the  NOAA Storm Prediction Center .

Frequently Asked Questions                                                 Where do tornadoes most often occur in The United States?         What is a tornado?     A tornado is a violently rotating column of air which descends from a thunderstorm to the ground. No other weather phenomenon can match the fury and destructive power of tornadoes. Tornadoes can be strong enough to destroy large buildings, leaving only the bare concrete foundation. In addition, they can lift 20-ton railroad cars from their tracks and they can drive straw and blades of grass into tree and telephone poles.     How do tornadoes form?     The truth is that scientists don't fully understand how tornadoes form. Typically, tornadoes develop several thousand feet above the earth's surface inside of a severe rotating thunderstorm. This type of storm is called a supercell thunderstorm. The spinning of these supercell thunderstorms is visible via Doppler radar.     What is a supercell thunderstorm?     A supercell is an organized thunderstorm that contains a very strong, rotating updraft. This rotation helps to produce severe weather events such as large hail, strong downbursts, and tornadoes. Supercell storms are usually isolated from other thunderstorms because it allows them to have more energy and moisture from miles around. These storms are rare, but always a threat to life and property.     What is the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado?     A tornado begins as a rotating, funnel-shaped cloud extending from a thunderstorm cloud base. A funnel cloud is made visible by cloud droplets, however, in some cases it can appear to be invisible due to lack of moisture. When the funnel cloud is half-way between the cloud base and the ground, it is called a tornado. The tornado's high-speed winds rotate about a small, relatively calm center, and suck up dust and debris, making the tornado darker and more easily seen.     What is the path length of tornadoes? How long do they last? How fast do they move?     Tornado paths range from 100 yards to one mile wide and are rarely more than 15 miles long. They can last from several seconds to more than an hour, however, most don't exceed 10 minutes. Most tornadoes travel from the southwest to northeast with an average speed of 30 mph, but the speed has been observed to range from almost no motion to 70 mph.     When and where do tornadoes occur?     Most tornadoes occur in the deep south and in the broad, relatively flat basin between the Rockies and the Appalachians, but no state is immune. Peak months of tornado activity in the U.S. are April, May, and June. However, tornadoes have occurred in every month and at all times of the day or night. A typical time of occurrence is on an unseasonably warm and sultry Spring afternoon between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m.     What causes tornadoes?     Tornadoes form under a certain set of weather conditions in which three very different types of air come together in a certain way. Near the ground lies a layer of warm and humid air, along with strong south winds. Colder air and strong west or southwest winds lie in the upper atmosphere. Temperature and moisture differences between the surface and the upper levels create what we call  instability . A necessary ingredient for tornado formation. The change in wind speed and direction with height is known as wind shear. This wind shear is linked to the eventual development of rotation from which a tornado may form.     A third layer of hot dry air becomes established between the warm moist air at low levels and the cool dry air aloft. This hot layer acts as a cap and allows the warm air underneath to warm further...making the air even more unstable. Things start to happen when a storm system aloft moves east and begins to lift the various layers. Through this lifting process the cap is removed, thereby setting the stage for explosive thunderstorm development as strong updrafts develop. Complex interactions between the updraft and the surrounding winds may cause the updraft to begin rotating-and a tornado is born.     The Great Plains of the Central United States are uniquely suited to bring all of these ingredients together, and so have become known as ""Tornado Alley."" The main factors are the Rocky Mountains to the west, the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and a terrain that slopes downward from west to east.     During the spring and summer months southerly winds prevail across the plains. At the origin of those south winds lie the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which provide plenty of  warm ,  humid air  needed to fuel severe thunderstorm development. Hot dry air forms over the higher elevations to the west, and becomes the cap as it spreads eastward over the moist Gulf air. Where the dry air and the Gulf air meet near the ground, a boundary known as a dry line forms to the west of Oklahoma. A storm system moving out of the southern Rockies may push the dry line eastward, with severe thunderstorms and tornadoes forming along the dry line or in the moist air just ahead of it.     What is the Fujita Tornado Damage Scale?     Dr. T. Theodore Fujita, a pioneer in the study of tornadoes and severe thunderstorm phenomena, developed the Fujita Tornado Damage Scale (F-Scale) to provide estimates of tornado strength based on damage surveys. Since it is extremely difficult to make direct measurements of tornado winds, an estimate of the winds based on damage is the best way to classify them. The new Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF-Scale) addresses some of the limitations identified by meteorologists and engineers since the introduction of the Fujita Scale in 1971. Variability in the quality of construction and different local building codes made classifying tornadoes in a uniform manner difficult. In many cases, these inconsistencies led to overestimates in the strength of tornadoes. The new scale identifies 28 different free standing structures most affected by tornadoes taking into account construction quality and maintenance. The range of tornado intensities remains as before, zero to five, with 'EF0' being the weakest, associated with very little damage and 'EF5' representing complete destruction, which was the case in Greensburg, Kansas on May 4th, 2007, the first tornado classified as 'EF5'. The EF scale was adopted on February 1, 2007.      The Storm Prediction Center  has a brief description of the new Enhanced Fujita Scale.  Here's  the full report submitted by the Wind Science and Engineering Center at Texas Tech University in PDF format.     A modification of the original Fujita Scale developed by ""Dr. Tornado"", T. Theodore Fujita of the University of Chicago.                 New EF Scale:     Old F-Scale:     Typical Damage:                     EF0 (65-85 mph)     F0 (65-73 mph)     Light damage . Peels surface off some roofs; some damage to gutters or siding; branches broken off trees; shallow-rooted trees pushed over.             EF1 (86-110 mph)     F1 (73-112 mph)     Moderate damage . Roofs severely stripped; mobile homes overturned or badly damaged; loss of exterior doors; windows and other glass broken.             EF2(111-135 mph)     F2 (113-157 mph)     Considerable damage . Roofs torn off well-constructed houses; foundations of frame homes shifted; mobile homes completely destroyed; large trees snapped or uprooted; light-object missiles generated; cars lifted off ground.             EF3 (136-165 mph)     F3 (158-206 mph)     Severe damage . Entire stories of well-constructed houses destroyed; severe damage to large buildings such as shopping malls; trains overturned; trees debarked; heavy cars lifted off the ground and thrown; structures with weak foundations blown away some distance.             EF4 (166-200 mph)     F4 (207-260 mph)     Devastating damage . Whole frame houses Well-constructed houses and whole frame houses completely leveled; cars thrown and small missiles generated.             EF5 (>200 mph)     F5 (261-318 mph)     Incredible damage . Strong frame houses leveled off foundations and swept away; automobile-sized missiles fly through the air in excess of 100 m (109 yd); high-rise buildings have significant structural deformation; incredible phenomena will occur.             EF No rating     F6-F12 (319 mph to speed of sound)     Inconceivable damage. Should a tornado with the maximum wind speed in excess of F5 occur, the extent and types of damage may not be conceived. A number of missiles such as iceboxes, water heaters, storage tanks, automoblies, etc.will create serious secondary damage on structures.

What          is a tornado?          The technical definition of a tornado is a violently rotating column in          contact with the ground that is usually pendant from a parent cumulonimbus          cloud. The vortex is usually, but not always, made visibly by a condensation          funnel cloud and/or a drbris cloud. On a local scale it is the most destructive          of all meteorological phenomena. Many tornadoes only last for a few minutes          and are on the ground for a few miles. But others can persist for hours,          travel more than a hundred miles, and have paths a mile wide. The word          tornado may have originated with a merging of the Latin  tornare ,          which means to turn, and the Spanish  tronada  (thunderstorm).         What          is the difference between a funnel and a tornado?          Both are violently whirling columns of air spawned by thunderstorms, but          in most usages of the word, the funnel refers to a vortex which is still          aloft whereas a tornado has descended to the surface. If the condensation          funnel has dropped more than half way from the cloud base to the surface,          a funnel is generally called a tornado because by this time damaging winds          are likely to be occurring on the ground. Sometimes the term funnel refers          to the visible portion of the vortex whether the or not the circulation          has reached the surface. The funnel can be made visible by either condensation          (the funnel cloud) or debris or both.    GO          TO TOP                     What causes tornadoes?          Conservation of angular momentum. Everyone has seen ice skaters who are          spinning while extending their arms and as soon as they tuck their arms          in close to the body, the rate of spin increases dramatically. Somewhat          the same thing happens in the atmosphere. An air mass always has a certain          amount of “spin” (technically called vorticity). As that air          is converged into the strong updraft of an intense thunderstorm, the rate          of spin increases, much like that of the skater. But while the basic principle          is recognized, the meteorological mechanisms are still poorly understood.          Do tornadoes form deep within the cloud and extend downward? Or does the          intense rotation form beneath the cloud and extend upwards. Or both? A          major research program was held during 1995 called VORTEX (verifying the          origins of rotation in tornadoes experiment) in which hundreds of meteorologists          drove around, flew near, electronically probed and photographed tornadic          thunderstorms from every conceivable angle. But unlike the movie “Twister”          where the “answer” was immediately “obvious,” it will          take years of data analysis to fully understand just what puts the twist          in the twister.         Where          is Tornado Alley?          A broad belt of the interior U.S. which extends from Texas northwards,          has more tornadoes than any place in the world. This is often called tornado          alley, although its exact geographic boundaries are ill-defined. Tornadoes          are not confined to this region, however. Tornadoes have been observed          in every state.           GO TO TOP                    What          is the Fujita Scale?          Just as there is a ""Richter Scale” to gauge earthquake intensities,          the ""Fujita Tornado Scale,"" based upon damage, classifies twisters          into six categories of wind speed (FO through F5), ranging from 40 to          300+ mph estimated wind speed. Placing sensors inside an F5 tornado became          the quest of the meteorologists in the movie “Twister.” The          Fujita scale was devised by Prof. T. Theodore Fujita (everyone calls him          Ted) of the University of Chicago. He is also called “Mr. Tornado”          because he conducted much of the pioneering work on tornadoes which serves          as the basis of today’s rapidly improving understanding of severe          storms. Since no one has ever been able to obtain wind measurements inside          a tornado (except for some recent Doppler radar studies), Prof. Fujita,          along with Allen Pearson, then the Director of the National Severe Storm          Forecasting Center, devised a way to convert the degree and type of damage          caused by a tornado into an estimate of the wind speeds inside the funnel.          Correctly using the “F” scale requires a lot of skill, but it          is still the best tool available today. Almost all tornadoes for the last          several decades have been classified according to the “F” rating.         The Fujita tornado          intensity scale in terms of the peak wind speeds within the funnel:         F0 (light damage):          40-72 mph          F1 (moderate damage): 73-112 mph          F2 (considerable damage): 113-157 mph          F3 (severe damage): 158-206 mph          F4 (devastating damage): 207-260 mph          F5 (incredible damage): 261-318 mph         No tornado is believed          to have exceeded F5, which itself is reached only a few times per year          in the 700-800 annual US tornadoes. The 3 May 1999 tornado in the Oklahoma          City area was observed by a portable Doppler which indicated winds at          the very end of the F5 scale, the strongest yet measured.         Note: In 2007, an enhanced Fujita Scale was introduced. Details can be found on the web site of NOAA's Storm Prediction Center:         www.spc.noaa.gov/efscale         How          many tornadoes reach “violent” status?          Tornadoes of F4 or F5 on the Fujita scale are classified as violent tornadoes.          Only 2% of U.S. tornadoes reach “violent” intensity, yet those          few result in 70% of all tornado deaths. Their winds exceed 200 mph and          they can stay on the ground for an hour or more.The strongest tornado          wind speeds are estimated to be in the 260-318 mph class. This corresponds          to a ranking of F5, the highest on the Fujita tornado scale. During the          last decade, less than a dozen twisters were estimated to reach this kinetic          milestone.  GO TO TOP                   When do tornadoes occur?          Whenever they want to. There is no real tornado season since they occur          in the U.S. during any month of the year, though the winter months see          them retreat to the far south and southwestern part of the country. April          is sometimes called the ""cruelest month"". And it is. As far          as U.S. tornado deaths are concerned, it has the highest toll. But numerically          the most tornadoes occur in May, although they tend to be somewhat less          violent and therefore less deadly. While the tornado “season”          is generally considered to be March through August, twisters can occur          whenever atmospheric conditions are “right.”          The tornado season          never really ends, it just slows down, and occasionally springs back to          life during what should be winter. On December 9, 1991, a tornado smashed          through McLean County, IL. About 20 empty railroad cars were blown off          the tracks near Bloomington. A camper was picked up, tossed 100 feet and          hurled into a tree. Fortunately the camping season had ended.         In the U.S., April          has the most tornado fatalities. May has the most tornado touch downs.          July has the most lightning strikes. And September the most hurricanes.          So, that leaves June and August for vacations?         What          is the peak time of day for tornadoes?          Tornadoes are creatures of the late afternoon, when most thunderstorms          are in progress. Over 40% of U.S. twisters are reported between 2 and          6 PM. But they can and do strike at any hour if conditions are right.          Nighttime tornadoes tend to be rather common along the U.S. Gulf Coast,          the hour of the day making them even more deadly because they are obviously          harder to see, and most people are sleeping and unaware of warnings (unless          they have a NOAA Weather Radio with Tone Alert). Early morning tornadoes          are unusual by not impossible. The only tornado directly witnessed by          the author whizzed past his front door at 8:15 on a Saturday morning while          he was out picking up the newspaper.  GO          TO TOP         What          shapes can tornadoes take ?          Most people have a mental image of a tornado...rather like an elephant's          trunk ...yet twisters come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Sometimes          they appear as roiling billows of smoke, other times a twisting rope,          or a barely visible swirl of dust. Some extremely violent ones appear          as several ""snake like"" vortices whirling around a common center.          Some especially large funnels, which can be a mile wide, are sometimes          called wedges. A tornado often goes through a life cycle starting as a          classic funnel shape, then broadening and widening in its mature stage,          sometimes almost looking like billows of smoke on the ground. Then it          enters the dissipating stage where it becomes thinner, long and often          very distorted. This is called the rope stage. But even when a tornado          is “roping out” it can still pack a pretty good wallop at the          ground.         What          are the strongest winds in a tornado?          How high are the strongest winds in a tornado? Once they were thought          to be over 500 mph, perhaps even supersonic. But research on damage patterns,          as well as recent measurements made by portable Doppler radars suggest          the highest winds are in the 280-320 mph range. Still a pretty fair breeze.          The strongest wind speeds in a tornado vortex are thought to occur about          300 feet above the ground. It is estimated that fully 90% of all tornadoes          fail to register winds above 113 mph.  GO          TO TOP         What          are suction vortices?          The ability of a passing tornado to destroy a building yet leave something          only a few feet away totally unscathed has long been a puzzle. Detailed          studies by Prof. T.T. Fujita of tornado films and videos as well as airborne          surveys of tornado damage demonstrated that many funnels break down into          smaller vortices rotating about a common center and moving along with          the mean speed of a tornado. These features, only tens of feet across,          cause much of the major damage and ""freakish"" destruction. These          suction vortices, as they are called, have dramatically higher wind speeds          than their parent funnel cloud. Thus when the main funnel passes over,          whether a house is severely damaged or not may depend on whether it gets          nailed by one of these smaller whirls. Some multi-vortex funnels do not          look like the commonly held image of a tornado, but can sometimes appear          to be swirls of smoke and multiple snake-like columns whirling about a          common core.          Are          there other tornado-like vortices in the atmosphere?          Aside from dust devils and steam devils, intense atmospheric whirls can          be found when there are unusually strong heat sources. Forest fires can          induce intense fire whirls that can exceed 100 mph and extend for more          than a mile in height. Similar vortices have been seen spring away from          volcanic eruption clouds, the Kuwaiti oil fires during the 1991 Gulf War,          and sometimes even in the exhuast plumes of large power plants.  GO          TO TOP         Do          rivers protect you from tornadoes?          No way. There are numerous reports of twisters crossing major rivers such          as the Mississippi and Missouri, damaging towns on both sides. And at          least 30 significant tornadoes have crossed the Mississippi River. More          than one river boat has been struck and sunk by twisters.         Where          do tornadoes form with respect to the parent storm cell?          Tornadoes have a strong tendency to form near the right rear portion of          a thunderstorm cell, particularly if it is an isolated storm called a          supercell. The apparent mesocyclone, out of which many tornadoes form,          is often centered in this updraft region of the storm. To the north and          east are falling the heavy rain and hail. But the mesocyclone, which often          appears as a hook-shaped echo on radar, tends to feature largely powerful          updrafts, and therefore the region is characterized by a rain free base.          Thus many tornadoes occur in areas with little rainfall (though sometimes          large hailstone may be falling). This explains why many tornado pictures          show clear skies in the background.  GO          TO TOP         What          is a wall cloud?          A wall cloud is a feature that accompanies and processes many tornadoes.          Its appearance is noted by severe storm spotters with concern and is a          visible manifestation of the tornado mesocyclone. It is an often abrupt          lowering of the rain-free base of the cumulonimbus cloud into a roughly          circular, low hanging cloud, one to four miles in diameter. The wall clouds          often have rapidly rising elements and are often rotating in the same          direction as the tornado, but at a much slower speed. The collar cloud          is a ring of cloud that sometimes surround the upper portion of the wall          cloud. The rotating wall cloud has been known to to appear as much as          an hour before touchdown.         What          are tornado chasers?          Crazy. Or least some of the amateurs who don’t really understand          what they are getting into could be described this way. Tornado researchers          have been chasing storms (ideally driving to areas where they believe          storms will form and then setting up for observations) for over two decades.          The early chasers were associated with the National Severe Storms Laboratory          and understood the behavior of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. The          chaser’s goal is to get close enough to get good data (whether video,          radar or other measurements) but to stay far enough away in order not          to get hurt or killed. There are also other hazards including giant hail,          lightning, downburst winds and rain slick roads. The movie “Twister”          glamorized storm chasing, but was highly unrealistic. No serious meteorologist          in their right mind would attempt getting as close to the funnels as portrayed          in the movie. Anyone inspired by the film to try a little chasing had          first better read up on what it’s like out there - that first grapefruit          size hailstone smashing through your windshield while you are driving          75 mph down an Interstate can ruin your day - and life!  GO          TO TOP         Do          hurricanes spawn tornadoes?          Yes, and quite frequently. During hurricanes, tornadoes are a hazard.          Some land falling tropical storms have spawned dozens of small twisters.          They frequently occur on the outer fringes of the advancing storm. It          is by no means unusual to be under both a tornado and hurricane watch          or warning at the same time. Hurricane Beulah (1967) generated as many          as 115 tornadoes upon making landfall in the U.S.         What          are the tornado death tolls for the United States?          Over 10,000 Americans have been killed by tornadoes in this century. There          have been, since 1880, at least 31 tornado outbreaks taking more than          100 lives. Between 1961 and 1990, the state with the highest annual average          tornado fatality rate has been Mississippi (10 per year) followed by Texas          (8), Indiana (7), Alabama (6), and Illinois, Ohio and Arkansas tied at          5 per year. The tornado death toll has been steadily decreasing, due in          large part to improved warnings, communications, emergency preparedness          and perhaps partially of the shift of population into urban areas.         What          was the single deadliest U.S. tornado outbreak?          The worst single tornado tragedy in the United States was the Tri-State          tornado outbreak (Missouri, Illinois and Indiana) of 18 March 1925. Several          tornadoes claimed a total of 747 lives with an additional 2027 persons          being injured. The largest of these twisters killed 695 persons, the worst          single tornado casualty toll ever.  GO          TO TOP         What          were the deadliest years for tornadoes in the U.S.?          The deadliest year for tornado deaths in the U.S. was 1925, when 794 died,          many in the infamous Tri-State tornado in Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.          In more recent years, 1953 was grim, with 519 fatalities. Tornadoes in          May and June, 1953 were especially deadly. On 11 May, 114 died in Waco,          TX. On June 8, 116 perished in Flint, MI. The next day the weather system          spawned a tornado in Worcester, MA, resulting in the loss of 90 more lives.          The year with the fewest reported U.S. tornado deaths is 1986, when only          16 citizens perished.          What          are the longest and shortest tornado paths on record?          A tornado on 18 March 1925 was believed to have stayed continuously on          the ground for 215 miles. The Great Tri-State tornado swept across portions          of Missouri, Illinois and Indiana. In 1917 a tornado was reported to have          traveled from Missouri to Indiana - a distance of 293 miles - while staying          on the ground for seven hours and 20 minutes. But without a detailed damage          survey it is difficult to tell whether the track may not have resulted          from several successive tornado touchdowns. At the other end of the spectrum,          one tornado touchdown was reported to be on the ground for a mere seven          feet.         What          was the biggest recorded tornado outbreak ever?          During the century, the largest single tornado outbreak occurred on 3-4          April 1974.          Over a span of 16 hours some 148 tornadoes slammed into 13 states east          of the Mississippi plus the province of Ontario. Some 315 people were          killed, 5,484 persons were injured and property damage was a half billion          (1973) dollars. The total number of miles of tornado path lengths was          2,598, with a mean path length for each twister of 19 miles. Six of the          148 funnels reached F5 intensity status. Six towns were struck not once,          but twice, in one day. The City of Xenia, OH saw both fortune and misfortune.          While many people were killed and the high school was largely destroyed,          most of the students had departed for the day. A group practicing a play          in the gymnasium saw the funnel approaching and were able to reach a safer          hallway just in time. A school bus was hurled through the roof onto the          stage where they had been practicing.  GO          TO TOP         What          are some other famous tornado outbreaks?          Palm Sunday (11 April) 1965 ranks as perhaps the second greatest outbreak          of U.S. tornadoes. Some 37 tornadoes killed 271 midwesterners. The injury          toll was greater than 5000.         The 3 May 1999 outbreak          in the Oklahoma City area produced over 50 touch downs, many in urban          and suburban areas. Over $1 billion in property losses were tallied, with          around 50 fatalities. One of the twisters were reported to have a peak          wind speed of about 315 mph, as determined by mobile Doppler radar, making          it the strongest wind ever recorded on Earth.         On 21 November 1992,          some 94 twisters blasted 13 states , ranging from Mississippi to Indiana          to Maryland, leaving 26 dead, 641 injured and causing $291 million in          damages. On 28 March 1984, 22 tornadoes killed 57, injured 1,248 and left          behind $200 million in damages in South and North Carolina. Ohio, Pennsylvania          and Ontario were ravaged by 41 tornadoes on 31 May 1985, killing 75 (in          the U.S.) , injuring 1.025 persons and damaging $450 worth of property.                   One may note that          these outbreaks did not occur in what is normally thought of as tornado          alley. Large outbreaks can and do occur almost any place east of the Rockies.          But in the alley from Texas to Iowa on 26-27 April 1991, 54 tornadoes          touched down, killing 21, injuring 208 and causing $277 million in damages.           GO TO TOP                    What          are your chances of being struck by a tornado?          Even if you were to camp out permanently in the heart of tornado alley,          statistically speaking you would most likely have to wait 1400 years before          being struck by a twister. Thus the “point probability” of direct          strike by a tornado is pretty small. But there is an awful lot of tornadoes          and “points” in the U.S., so during the peak of the season,          at least five a day are touching down somewhere in the U.S. Many tornado          researchers have never seen a tornado. Prof. T. T. Fujita, of the University          of Chicago, called “Mr. Tornado” by many, had to wait more than          30 years before seeing his first live tornado. His custom license plate          long described his period of frustration, TT 0000.         What          is a waterspout?          A tornado over water is often called a waterspout. It is generally weaker          than its landlubbing cousins. The area around the Florida Keys is prime          waterspout territory. Peak winds are typically in the 50 to 100 mph range,          enough to flip over the dingy for anyone thinking it’s cool to sail          into one. Some waterspouts have moved inland causing damage and injuries          so they are not to be taken lightly. Waterspouts generally are not associated          with severe storms, but with average rain showers and weak thunderstorms.          They are sometimes found over the Great Lakes, and even the Great Salt          Lake, during period of intense cold air outbreaks over the warm water.          When a genuine tornado just happens to move offshore, say crossing a lake          or a river, it may be technically called a waterspout, but it doesn’t          know that. It is still a tornado - just located over water.         Two men were reported          missing on 18 June 1993 after a waterspout swept through Chicago’s          harbor. One man was blown off a pier while the other, a wind surfer, was          nowhere to be found after the vortex passed.  GO          TO TOP         What          is a dust devil?          Dust devils are atmospheric whirlwinds which, while superficially resembling          small tornadoes, form by totally different mechanisms. These swirling          columns, which can rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise, form on          sunny, hot days with relatively light winds, often over plowed fields          or expanses of dirt or pavement. They result from superheated air near          the sun baked ground rising into the cooler air aloft. These whirling          dervishes, unlike the tornado, are not associated with thunderstorms.          In some cases, wind speeds can kick up well over 50 mph. In a few cases,          they have been seem to extend to over 5000 feet above ground.         Most dust devils just          swirl across an open field and kick up a few puffs of dust and a handful          of leaves. Some exceptionally large and long lived dervishes, however,          if traveling over loose soil, can sweep upwards of 50 tons of dust and          debris skyward.         What          are some unusually strong dust devils?          One of the biggest ever formed over the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.          It grew to 24500 feet altitude and traveled for over 40 miles. One huge          dust devils was seen swirling away while standing in place for over an          hour in a trucking terminal near Des Moines. A large dust devil in New          Mexico developed at the edge of a railroad embankment and excavated over          a cubic meter of sand per hour for over four hours! It stopped only when          a bulldozer was parked nearby, apparently interrupting the airflow into          the vortex. Some dust devils have been known to overturn trailers and          even down power lines in Arizona.         An unusually powerful          dust devil swept a 300 yard long swath near Minong, WI on 6 May 1995.          It damaged the roof of a house, tore through a snow fence, and caused          a small fire when it downed a power line.          One day in March 1995,          it was a beautiful sunny day in upstate South Carolina, with barely a          cloud in the sky. Suddenly, a covered porch at a rural residence was smashed          to smithereens by a sudden gust of wind with wreckage scattered over several          acres. What happened? The best explanation is that a large dust devil          swirled up from the hot ground. Most dust devils have winds under 50 mph          and rarely cause damage, but as evidenced above, some are larger.  GO          TO TOP         What          state is Number 1 in tornadoes?          We are not sure why a state would want that distinction, except perhaps          to attract the producers of the sequel to “Twister” to go on          location, but that seemingly simply question has a large variety of answers.          It depends on how you define Numero Uno:         Texas - number of          total tornado deaths (regardless of size)          Oklahoma - number of significant and violent tornadoes per square mile          Florida - number of tornado touchdowns per square mile, of any intensity          Arkansas - highest number of killer tornadoes per square mile          Kansas - highest number of F5 t intensity tornadoes since 1880          Iowa - greatest number of F5 tornadoes per square mile          Tennessee - highest percentage of tornadoes that causes fatalities          Alabama - highest percentage of tornadoes rated as of significant intensity          Kentucky - highest percentage of all tornadoes ranked as violent (F4 or          F5)          Indiana - highest rank on scoring system measuring all aspects of tornadoes          Mississippi - highest percentage of population killed by tornadoes          Delaware - highest concentration of tornadoes causing injury         So, who is number          one? Statistics, it has been said, can be used the way a drunk uses a          lamppost, either for enlightenment or support. Or as Mark Twain said,          “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics.”         Is          it possible to survive a tornado?          Yes. In fact the odds are very much in your favor if you follow the basic          safety rules. During the monster outbreak of 3-4 April 1974, over 30,000          people were directly involved inside tornadic vortices. While 315 people          did perish, a full 99% of those directly affected by the tornado outbreak          survived.            Who          are most at risk in tornadoes?           Persons in mobile homes and automobiles, and in general the elderly, the          very young and the physically or mentally impaired. Also at risk are those          who have a language barrier to understanding a tornado warning as well          as anyone else who doesn’t take precautions when a tornado threatens.         What          can you do before a tornado to improve your survival odds?          It’s too late to buy a smoke detector after the fire starts. And          there are some things you should do before a twister is coming up the          driveway. When a tornado warning has just been issued and/or you see a          twister bearing down on you, you should move to a pre-designated shelter          (basement or interior room). Everyone in the home/school/office should          know in advance where to go. You should consider having drills. Be sure          you know what county you live in, or are visiting (surprisingly many people          don’t), since warnings are often issued on a county basis. Have a          NOAA Weather Radio with a warning alarm to automatically receive warnings.          Also monitor commercial radio and television. Have a supply of batteries          for flashlights and the weather radio as well as a first aid kit.  GO          TO TOP         What          should you do if a tornado threatens?          If there is warning, or skies appear threatening, do not panic. But be          prepared to move immediately to a pre-designated shelter, such as a basement.          Remember, at night or during heavy rainstorms waiting before you can see          the funnel before taking action can be a fatal mistake.         If an underground          shelter is not available, move to an interior room or hallway on the lowest          floor and get under a sturdy piece of furniture. Bathrooms, with their          reinforcing plumbing, are often relatively good shelters. The bathtub          itself is a good option. Stay away from windows at all costs - flying          glass is a major hazard. If caught outside, lie flat in a ditch, culvert          or ravine, or any depressed area that may shelter you from flying debris. Do not seek shelter under a  bridge or overpass, as the winds can be chanelled though at even greater speeds, carrying deadly misiles. The overall goal is to avoid being struck          by flying debris. Mobile homes, even if tied down, offer little protection          from tornadoes, and should be abandoned. Protect your head from flying          debris. Wearing a football or motorcycle helmet is not a bad idea. The          scene in Twister in which the stars lash themselves to a well pipe when          being engulfed in the F5 funnel made no sense whatsoever. They would have          been blasted by high speed debris and would have looked like beef jerky          by the time the funnel was through with them.         A good source of current tornado safety tips is NOAA's Storm Prediction Center: www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#Safety         Is          a train a safe place to be during a tornado?          .The passenger train “The Empire Builder” had a confrontation          with a large tornado on the tracks near Moorhead, MN on 27 May 1931. The          train lost. Eight coach cars, each weighing more than 80 tons, were derailed.          One shifted more than 80 feet off the tracks. One passenger was killed         What          are the signs of an imminent tornado?          Even with today’s advanced radars and spotter networks, tornadoes          can form suddenly and unexpectedly, without warning. Your own senses then          become your front line of defense. Especially if there have been severe          thunderstorms present in the area, a loud, thunderous roaring noise growing          ever louder should be cause for immediate alarm. Many tornadoes occur          outside the rain area, so don’t assume that the lack of rain is a          good omen. In fact tornadoes can even strike when you can see a lot of          blue sky. Large hail is often present in the vicinity of funnels.  GO          TO TOP                   Should          you open windows or doors during tornado warnings?           NO! This is an old wives tale. Creating an opening for the wind may actually          increase damage and in any case being near a window exposes you to deadly          flying glass. It used to be thought that much of the damage from tornadoes          resulted from unequalized air pressure as the funnel moved over a building.          It is now ascertained that it is primarily the wind effects that cause          most structural damage. Any opening, including a garage door, that allows          for the wind to “enter” the structure and begin acting on walls          and ceilings increases the chance of damage.         Are          tornadoes unique to the United States?          No, tornadoes occur in many countries around the world, although three          out of four twisters do touch down in the U.S. of A. They tend to occur          at mid-latitudes in regions experiencing strong surface fronts and jet          streams aloft. Tornadoes are rare in the tropics. Australia may be the          closest to the U.S. in term of tornado potential, but the sparse population          makes a climatology difficult. Other countries experiencing a significant          number of twisters include New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and in          the northern hemisphere, much of middle Europe from Italy north into England          and Russia. Jolly olde England actually can get some jolly severe weather.          While nowhere near as frequent as in the US, at least 50 tornadoes were          reported in an 82 year period ending in 1949. October is the peak month          for British twisters. Japan, eastern China, northern India, Pakistan and          Bangladesh. Twisters have even spun up over Bermuda and the Fiji Islands          are also at risk.         Though the frequencies          of touchdowns are much less than in the U.S. other countries suffer fatalities          from tornadoes. On 24 June 1904 a killer tornado swept through portions          of Moscow, Russia taking at least 24 lives. On 19 march 1978, a tornado          struck New Delhi, India. Seventeen persons perished and 700 were injured.          In 1995 hundreds were reported killed in a tornado in Pakistan.  GO          TO TOP         What          is the first known movie record of a tornado?          While spectacular tornado shots made with home camcorders are now almost          commonplace on the nightly news, getting such footage in the “old          days” wasn’t so easy. The first known film of an actual tornado          was made in 1933. This is nearly two decades earlier than the 1951 Corn,          OK tornado film once believed to be the earliest. And no, “The Wizard          of Oz” did not use actual tornado footage. It was a Hollywood special          effect - and a pretty darn good one. Video of an actual tornado taken          several years ago looks spookily similar to the one which whisked Dorothy          off to Oz.         What          tornado almost changed American pop culture?          A tornado almost changed the course of popular music in the 20th century.          On April 5, 1936, a devastating tornado ravaged Tupelo, Mississippi, killing          over 200 residents. One of those who survived the devastation was an infant          by the name of Elvis Aaron Presley.         Has          anyone even seen the inside of a tornado?          And lived to tell about it......Yes. On 3 May 1943. McKinnet, Texas farmer          Roy Hall survived the day. Not a bad feat since he had found himself trapped          inside a 150 yard wide tornado funnel, and was able to look straight up          into the rapidly whirling vortex for over a thousand feet. It looked rather          like the inside of an elephant’s trunk. It also had a small mini-tornadoes          spinning of the smooth wall of clouds, and these were illuminated by almost          constant lightning.  GO          TO TOP         How          many tornadoes actually kill people?          Only between 1 and 2% of U.S. tornadoes result in human fatalities. During          1993, there were 1167 confirmed twister touchdowns. Of these only 16 resulted          in deaths. This is a testament to the ongoing improvement in the timeliness          and accuracy of the National Weather Service’s tornado watches and          warnings. It also suggests that once warned, it is relatively easy to          find a safe haven even if a tornado is bearing down on you.         Do          cows fly in tornadoes?          Yes. As do pigs, horses, and pickup trucks. A large tornado swept through          Eau Claire County, Wisconsin on 27 August 1994. Among the casualties were          200 dairy cows. The storm could be said to have caused udder destruction.          A twister swept through the grazing lands around Ashley, ND on 6 July          1962. And while it failed to strike any building, it did roar though a          herd of cattle, leaving 68 animals dead in its wake.         Do          tornadoes have ""eyes”?          The eye of a hurricane is the often clear, nearly calm center about which          the violent storm rotates. But does the much smaller tornadic vortex have          a similar ""calm"" core? Very possibly. Both theoretical and observational          evidence suggests that the inner portion of the tornado funnel may be          largely cloud free and have relatively light winds.  GO          TO TOP         Do          cities attract tornadoes?          This is not easily answered. Population density significantly affects          the probability for a tornado being detected and reported. In many rural          areas there is “nothing” for a tornado to hit, nor anyone there          to see it not be hit. Moreover, in rural areas in the past people have          been less prone to report tornadoes to authorities. Thus the statistics          are biased to more heavily populated areas. Some have even suggested that          tornadoes tend to avoid cities, but there seems to be little evidence          of this. Build it and they will come. Unfortunately this may apply to          cities and tornadoes. Scientists at Texas A&M University find that          urban and suburban counties are more likely than primarily rural counties          to experience tornadoes.         What          is the largest death toll from a tornado?          If one broadens the definition beyond humans, this case might be a leading          candidate. On 26 April 1994 a tornado swept through a turkey farm in Barron          County, WI. As one might expect, this foul wind flattened the fowl - some          10,000 perished.         What          is the record for July tornadoes?          July 1993 set an all-time U.S. tornado record for that month with 234          twisters touching down. A “normal” July total is 94, but July,          1993 was hardly normal, it being the peak of the Great Floods of 1993          in the Mississippi and Missouri River Valleys.         Are          tornadoes attracted to trailer home parks?          One might think so, given the frequency with which they appear in storm          damage reports. The reasons are twofold. First, there are many more trailer          home parks in the nation than people realize. Second, the construction          of these homes is such that they provide far less resistance to strong          winds than conventional construction. If not properly tied down, they          can begin to “fly” at wind speeds not much over 70 mph. Trailer          home parks should have storm shelters. Never try to ride out a tornado,          or even a severe thunderstorm in a trailer home.  GO          TO TOP         A tornado ripped through          a southeastern Tennessee trailer home park on 26 April 1994. A man was          killed. His daughter and grandson were in a nearby trailer which was also          destroyed, but the daughter landed in a pile of rubble 300 yards away          and the 9-month-old infant was tossed 100 yards. Both were injured but          survived.         Why do you think they          call them mobile homes? On August 5, 1992, a South Carolina tornado rolled          a mobile home over THREE TIMES - and its lucky occupant managed to walk          away without serious injury.          Can          you have a tornado when the sun is shining?          Yes. Many tornadoes occur very close to the edge of the violent thunderstorm          cloud that gives them birth. It is entirely possible, especially in the          hour or so just before sunset, that the tornado itself could be in full          sunlight for much of its life cycle.         Is          the number of tornadoes increasing?          No, but the statistics are going up. In the 1950s there were 4,793 tornadoes          reported in the United States. In the 1980s, there were 8194. Climate          change? No. More people now live in or travel through the most tornado          prone parts of the nation. There are now vastly better means of communications          and the reporting of severe weather (if you see a twister, call 911,if          you can do so safely).  GO          TO TOP         Are          tornado fatalities increasing?          No, in fact there has been a long term downward trend in tornado deaths          in the U.S., in spite of a steadily increasing population. In 1993, a          then record number of 957 severe thunderstorm and tornado watches were          issued by the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (now named the Storm          Prediction Center). The 1993 death toll from severe thunderstorms and          tornadoes dropped to 33, well below the 30-year average of 82 fatalities.          In the pre-forecast days in the 1930s, tornadoes alone killed almost 200          people each year.         What          day is least likely to see a tornado in the U.S.?          If recent history is any guide, the 16th of January is a good bet, the          only day of the year in this century (through 1993) on which a tornado          touchdown has not been reported somewhere in the United States. There          is at least one tornado touchdown somewhere in the U.S. on at least half          the days of a typical year. More than ten tornadoes in a single day occur          only 2.4 % of all days, or 9 times per year.                   Is          there double jeopardy in tornado strikes?          Since tornadoes are relatively rare, at least in these regions that you          might have to wait centuries for one to strike any given point, you would          figure that once you have been hit by a tornado, it would be clear sailing          from then on out, right? Sure, but there are always exceptions. Statistics          alone can not protect you.         When Your Number Is          Up Department: on 2 December 1982 a Missouri man was injured when his          home was flattened by a tornado. He moved into a trailer home for temporary          shelter - and three weeks later was killed when a second tornado came          through town.         Right Place at the          Wrong Time Department: a house in Collinsville, IL was destroyed by a          tornado on 18 May 1883. The rebuilt structure was hit again on 30 March          1938.         The possibility of          a building being struck by a tornado is rare, typically less than once          per thousand years. But one church in Guy, Arkansas has been damaged by          twisters three times during the last century.         Statistically, you          will have to wait hundreds of years to be struck by a tornado standing          at any one spot in ""tornado alley"". But on 16 Match 1942, Baldwin,          MI was lashed by a tornado, and before the clean up could even begin,          another twister trotted through town only 25 minutes later.         War is hell but nothing          like Nebraska ... a sentiment that must have been expressed by the Spanish          American War veteran who returned home to Nebraska in 1899, only to have          his house destroyed in a twister. He moved to Omaha, only to have his          house destroyed again in 1913. There is no record of whether he went   "

Tornadoes come in many sizes, but are         typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, with the narrow         end touching the earth. Often, a cloud of debris encircles the lower         portion of the funnel.                       Most         tornadoes have wind speeds of 110 mph (175 km/h) or less, are         approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles         (several kilometers) before dissipating. However, some tornadoes attain         wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than         a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles         (more than 100 km).                                                         A         tornado near Oklahoma                                   Although         tornadoes have been observed on every continent except  Antarctica ,         most occur in the  United         States . Other areas where they commonly occur include south-central  Canada ,         south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America, Southern         Africa, northwestern and central  Europe ,          Italy , western and         southeastern  Australia ,         and  New Zealand .                                   Definitions                       A          tornado  is defined by the  Glossary of Meteorology  as         "" a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground,         either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud,         and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud... ""                                   Condensation         funnel                       A         tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure         caused by the high wind speeds (see Bernoulli's principle) and rapid         rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually causes water vapor in         the air to condense into a visible  condensation funnel . Strictly,         the term tornado refers to the vortex of wind, not the condensation         cloud.                       A          funnel cloud  is a visible condensation funnel with no associated         strong winds at the surface. Not all funnel clouds evolve into a         tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud as the         mesocyclonic rotation descends toward the ground. Most tornadoes produce         strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the         ground, so it is difficult to tell the difference between a funnel cloud         and a tornado from a distance.                                   Tornado         family                       Occasionally         a single storm produces multiple tornadoes and mesocyclones. This         process is known as cyclic tornadogenesis. Tornadoes produced from the         same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . Sometimes         multiple tornadoes from distinct mesocyclones occur simultaneously.                                   Tornado         outbreak                       Occasionally,         several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system.         While there is no single agreed-upon definition, multiple tornadoes         spawned by the same storm system with no break in activity is considered         a  tornado outbreak . A period of several successive days with         tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather         systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an         extended tornado outbreak.                                   Etymology                       The         word ""tornado"" is an altered form of the  Spanish          word  tronada , which means ""thunderstorm"". This in turn         was taken from the Latin  tonare , meaning ""to thunder"".         It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the         Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however,         this may be a folk etymology. Tornadoes are also commonly referred to as          twisters .                                                         A         waterspout near the Florida Keys                                   Types         of tornadoes                       True         tornadoes                       Multiple         vortex tornado                       A          multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more         columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex         structure can occur in almost any circulation, however it is very often         observed in intense tornadoes.                                   Satellite         tornado                       A          satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very         near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The         satellite tornado may appear to ""orbit"" the larger tornado         (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex         tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much         smaller than the main funnel.                                   Waterspout                       A          waterspout  is officially defined by the U.S. National Weather         Service simply as a tornado over water. Amongst researchers, however,         they are typically divided into two categories: ""fair weather""         waterspouts, and tornadic waterspouts.                                     ""Fair             weather"" waterspouts are the less-severe (but far more common)             variety, and are similar in dynamics to dust devils and landspouts.             They form from the bases of cumulus congestus (also called             ""convective cumulus"") cloud towers in tropical and             semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds (F0 on the             Fujita scale), smooth laminar walls, and typically travel very             slowly, if at all (since the cloud they are attached to is being             formed by convective action instead of the interaction between             colliding fronts). They occur more commonly in the Florida Keys than             anywhere on Earth.                           Tornadic             waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"", and             form the same way as tornadoes. A tornado which spawns in the             traditional manner on land and later crosses into a body of water             would also be considered a tornadic waterspout. Since they form from             severe thunderstorms and have the capacity to be far more intense,             faster, and longer-lived than their fair weather cousins, they are             considered to be far more dangerous.                                                                    A         landspout near North Platte, Nebraska on May 22, 2004                                   Landspout                       A          landspout  is an unofficial term for a tornado not associated with         a mesocyclone. The name stems from their characterization as essentially         a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". They share most of the         characteristics with their water-based brethren, including relative         weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which         often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively         laminar cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, owing to         their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually         weaker than classic tornadoes, they still possess strong winds and can         cause serious damage.                                   Tornado-like         circulations                       Gustnado                       A          gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl         associated with a gust front or downburst. Because they are technically         not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether         or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast         moving cold, dry outflow air from a thunderstorm is blown through a mass         of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a         ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a roll cloud). If         low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned         horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The         result is a gustnado. They usually cause small areas of heavier         rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is         also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence         from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately cyclonic and         anticyclonic without preference.                                   Dust         devil                       A          dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling         column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as         strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective         updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low         level wind shear, the column of hot, rising   air  can develop a small         cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not         considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not         associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result         in major damage and fatalities, especially in arid areas.                                   Fire         whirl                       Tornado-like         circulations occasionally occur near large, intense wildfires and are         called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in         the rare case where they connect to a pyrocumulus or other cumuliform         cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes         associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant         damage.                                             Cold         air vortex                       A          cold air vortex  or  shear funnel  is a tiny, harmless funnel         cloud which occasionally forms underneath or on the sides of normal         cumuliform clouds, rarely causing any winds at ground-level. Their         genesis and mechanics are poorly understood, as they are quite rare,         short lived, and hard to spot (due to their non-rotational nature and         small size).                                                         Dust         devil in Johnsonville, South Carolina                                   Characteristics                       Shape                       Most         tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow funnel, a few hundred yards         (a few hundred meters) across, with a small cloud of debris near the         ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.                       Small,         relatively weak landspouts may only be visible as a small swirl of dust         on the ground. While the condensation funnel may not extend all the way         to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph         (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. Large         single-vortex tornadoes can look like large wedges stuck into the         ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . A         wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds. Even         experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference         between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance.                       Tornadoes         in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often         curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping         out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes         can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be         completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a         single funnel.                       In         addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by         rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even         experienced meteorologists might not spot them.                                   Size                       In         the United States, an average tornado is around 500 feet (150 m)         across, and stays on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). While this         is the average, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even         for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating         tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across.         In fact, a tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet         (2 m) long. On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can         have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A tornado that         affected Hallam, Nebraska on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles         (4 km) wide at the ground.                       In         terms of path length, the Tri-State Tornado, which affected parts of         Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925, was officially on the         ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes         which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles or longer are actually a         family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however,         there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the         Tri-State Tornado. In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that         the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than         previously thought.                                   Appearance                       Tornadoes,         depending on the environment in which they form, can have a wide range         of colors. Tornadoes which form in a dry environment can be nearly         invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel.         Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to         white. While travelling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can         turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot         of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris.         Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint         of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over         snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white in the process.                                                         T wo         photographs of the Waurika, Oklahoma tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at         nearly the same time by two different photographers. In the top picture,         the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing         camera, so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where         the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit ,         with the sun behind the clouds                                           Lighting         conditions are also a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A         tornado which is ""back-lit"", or viewed with the sun behind it,         will appear to be very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at         the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which         occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in         hues of yellow, orange, and pink.                       Dust         kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail,         and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the         visibility of tornadoes, making them ""invisible"", in essence.         Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since         only radar observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching         tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately         most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base ,         or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or         no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when         the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Also, night-time         tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning. There is mounting         evidence, including DOW mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts,         which suggest that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with         extremely low pressure, akin to the eye found in tropical cyclones. This         area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light         winds, and be very dark, with the light blocked out by swirling debris         on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of         illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado.                                   Rotation                       Tornadoes         normally rotate cyclonically in direction (counterclockwise in the         northern hemisphere, clockwise in the southern). While large-scale         storms always rotate cyclonically due to the Coriolis effect,         thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of         Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as demonstrated physically by the         Rossby number. Supercells and tornadoes would rotate cyclonically even         without the Coriolis effect, as evidenced by their doing so in numerical         simulations which neglect the Coriolis component. Low-level mesocyclones         and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the         supercell and ambient environment.                       Approximately         1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only         landspouts and gustnados rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those         which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending RFD in a         cyclonic supercell. However, on rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes         form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic         supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a         companion tornadoither or a satellite tornado or associated with         anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.                                   Sound         and seismology                       Tornadoes         emit widely on the acoustics spectrum and multiple mechanisms cause the         sound of a tornado. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported         throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the earwitness         and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Among the popularly         reported sounds are a freight train, rushing rapids or a waterfall, and         a jet engine from close proximity, or combinations thereof. Many         tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation         distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and         topography.                       The         winds of both the tornado vortex and constituent turbulent eddies, as         well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to         the sound of a tornado; this is evidenced by both funnel clouds and         tornadoes having sounds, and the associated sounds differing. Funnel         clouds and small tornadoes are reported as a whistling, whining,         humming, or the buzzing of innumerable bees or electricity, or more or         less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep         rumbling, or an irregular sound of oise It is important to note         that many tornadoes do not produce any sound unless one is within very         close proximity, so sound is not reliable forewarning of a tornado; and         that not only tornadoes but also any strong, damaging wind, even a         severe hail volley or continuous thunder within a thunderstorm may         produce a roaring sound.                                                         Illustration         of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the Earth System Research         Laboratory's Infrasound Program                                   In         addition to the audible spectrum, tornadoes also produce identifiable         infrasonic signatures. Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures         have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of         low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing in developing tornado         prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding         tornado morphology, dynamics, and tornadogenesis. Tornadoes also produce         a detectable seismic signature, although research continues on isolating         the signature and understanding the process.                                   Electromagnetic,         lightning, and other effects                       Tornadoes         emit on the  electromagnetic          spectrum, for example, with sferics and E-field effects detected. The         effects vary, mostly with little observed consistency. Luminosity has         been reported in the past, and is probably due to misidentification of         external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and power flashes         from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and         are not known to ever been recorded. Correlations with patterns of  lightning          activity have also been observed, however, no consistent correlations         have been advanced. Electromagnetics and lightning have little to         nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are         basically a thermodynamic phenomenon), though there are likely         connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.                       In         addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric         variables such as temperature, moisture, and pressure; for example, in         June 2004, a probe measured a 100 mb (hPa) (2.95 inHg) pressure         drop.                                                         S equence         of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base         lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while         winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally,         the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing         major damage. This tornado, near Dimmitt, Texas, was one of the         best-observed violent tornadoes in history                                   Life         cycle                       Supercell         relationship                       Tornadoes         often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells .         Supercells contain mesocyclones, an area of organized rotation a few         miles up in the atmosphere, usually 1 miles (20 km)         across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the Enhanced         Fujita Scale) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very         heavy rain, frequent  lightning , strong wind gusts, and hail are common         in such storms.                       Most         tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. The cycle         begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly         descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft         accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's         rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.                                   Tornado         formation                       As         the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel         appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating         wall cloud. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground,         creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the         tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of         the RFD reaching the ground.                       Initially,         the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it         grows until it reaches the  mature stage . During its mature stage,         which can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, a         tornado often causes the most damage, and can in rare instances be more         than one mile across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool         surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow         of warm air which feeds the tornado.                                   Maturity         and demise                       As         the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply,         the vortex begins to weaken, becoming thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating         stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the         tornado fizzles. During the dissipating stage the shape of the tornado         becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be         blown into fantastic patterns.                       As         the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone         often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow         powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop         cyclically. As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate,         the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the         center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start         again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded )         mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.                       Though         this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and         die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as         landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices.         These each have different mechanisms which influence their         developmentowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this         one.                                                         Example         of EF3 damage - roof and some inner walls of brick building have been         demolished                                   Intensity         and damage                       The         Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage         caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita         scale, with engineered (by expert elicitation) wind estimates and better         damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the         Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0          tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas         an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving         them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale         ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for         the most powerful known tornadoes. Radar data, photogrammetry, and         ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to         determine intensity and award a rating.                       Tornadoes         vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong         tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with         track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes         tend to be stronger. In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small         portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher         intensity from subvortices.                       In         the United States,  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 )         tornadoes account for 80% of all tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops         off quickly with increasing strengthiolent tornadoes (stronger than  EF4 ,          T8 ), account for less than 1% of all tornado reports. Outside of         the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of         southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are         extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of         tornadoes overall, however, as research has found that tornado intensity         distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes         occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South         America, respectively.                                   Climatology                       The                   United States  has the most tornadoes of any country, seeing about four         times the activity estimated in all of Europe (not including         waterspouts). This is mostly due to the unique geography of the         continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends         from the tropical south into  arctic          areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow         between these two areas. In the middle latitudes, where most tornadoes         of the world occur, the Rocky Mountains block moisture and atmospheric         flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the troposphere, and causing         cyclogenesis downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert         Southwest also feeds drier air and the dry line, while the Gulf of         Mexico fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows         for many collisions of warm and cold air; creating the conditions         necessary to breed strong, long-lived storms which occur many times a         year. A large portion of these tornadoes form  "

Frequently Asked Questions                                                 Where do tornadoes most often occur in The United States?         What is a tornado?     A tornado is a violently rotating column of air which descends from a thunderstorm to the ground. No other weather phenomenon can match the fury and destructive power of tornadoes. Tornadoes can be strong enough to destroy large buildings, leaving only the bare concrete foundation. In addition, they can lift 20-ton railroad cars from their tracks and they can drive straw and blades of grass into tree and telephone poles.     How do tornadoes form?     The truth is that scientists don't fully understand how tornadoes form. Typically, tornadoes develop several thousand feet above the earth's surface inside of a severe rotating thunderstorm. This type of storm is called a supercell thunderstorm. The spinning of these supercell thunderstorms is visible via Doppler radar.     What is a supercell thunderstorm?     A supercell is an organized thunderstorm that contains a very strong, rotating updraft. This rotation helps to produce severe weather events such as large hail, strong downbursts, and tornadoes. Supercell storms are usually isolated from other thunderstorms because it allows them to have more energy and moisture from miles around. These storms are rare, but always a threat to life and property.     What is the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado?     A tornado begins as a rotating, funnel-shaped cloud extending from a thunderstorm cloud base. A funnel cloud is made visible by cloud droplets, however, in some cases it can appear to be invisible due to lack of moisture. When the funnel cloud is half-way between the cloud base and the ground, it is called a tornado. The tornado's high-speed winds rotate about a small, relatively calm center, and suck up dust and debris, making the tornado darker and more easily seen.     What is the path length of tornadoes? How long do they last? How fast do they move?     Tornado paths range from 100 yards to one mile wide and are rarely more than 15 miles long. They can last from several seconds to more than an hour, however, most don't exceed 10 minutes. Most tornadoes travel from the southwest to northeast with an average speed of 30 mph, but the speed has been observed to range from almost no motion to 70 mph.     When and where do tornadoes occur?     Most tornadoes occur in the deep south and in the broad, relatively flat basin between the Rockies and the Appalachians, but no state is immune. Peak months of tornado activity in the U.S. are April, May, and June. However, tornadoes have occurred in every month and at all times of the day or night. A typical time of occurrence is on an unseasonably warm and sultry Spring afternoon between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m.     What causes tornadoes?     Tornadoes form under a certain set of weather conditions in which three very different types of air come together in a certain way. Near the ground lies a layer of warm and humid air, along with strong south winds. Colder air and strong west or southwest winds lie in the upper atmosphere. Temperature and moisture differences between the surface and the upper levels create what we call  instability . A necessary ingredient for tornado formation. The change in wind speed and direction with height is known as wind shear. This wind shear is linked to the eventual development of rotation from which a tornado may form.     A third layer of hot dry air becomes established between the warm moist air at low levels and the cool dry air aloft. This hot layer acts as a cap and allows the warm air underneath to warm further...making the air even more unstable. Things start to happen when a storm system aloft moves east and begins to lift the various layers. Through this lifting process the cap is removed, thereby setting the stage for explosive thunderstorm development as strong updrafts develop. Complex interactions between the updraft and the surrounding winds may cause the updraft to begin rotating-and a tornado is born.     The Great Plains of the Central United States are uniquely suited to bring all of these ingredients together, and so have become known as ""Tornado Alley."" The main factors are the Rocky Mountains to the west, the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and a terrain that slopes downward from west to east.     During the spring and summer months southerly winds prevail across the plains. At the origin of those south winds lie the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which provide plenty of  warm ,  humid air  needed to fuel severe thunderstorm development. Hot dry air forms over the higher elevations to the west, and becomes the cap as it spreads eastward over the moist Gulf air. Where the dry air and the Gulf air meet near the ground, a boundary known as a dry line forms to the west of Oklahoma. A storm system moving out of the southern Rockies may push the dry line eastward, with severe thunderstorms and tornadoes forming along the dry line or in the moist air just ahead of it.     What is the Fujita Tornado Damage Scale?     Dr. T. Theodore Fujita, a pioneer in the study of tornadoes and severe thunderstorm phenomena, developed the Fujita Tornado Damage Scale (F-Scale) to provide estimates of tornado strength based on damage surveys. Since it is extremely difficult to make direct measurements of tornado winds, an estimate of the winds based on damage is the best way to classify them. The new Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF-Scale) addresses some of the limitations identified by meteorologists and engineers since the introduction of the Fujita Scale in 1971. Variability in the quality of construction and different local building codes made classifying tornadoes in a uniform manner difficult. In many cases, these inconsistencies led to overestimates in the strength of tornadoes. The new scale identifies 28 different free standing structures most affected by tornadoes taking into account construction quality and maintenance. The range of tornado intensities remains as before, zero to five, with 'EF0' being the weakest, associated with very little damage and 'EF5' representing complete destruction, which was the case in Greensburg, Kansas on May 4th, 2007, the first tornado classified as 'EF5'. The EF scale was adopted on February 1, 2007.      The Storm Prediction Center  has a brief description of the new Enhanced Fujita Scale.  Here's  the full report submitted by the Wind Science and Engineering Center at Texas Tech University in PDF format.     A modification of the original Fujita Scale developed by ""Dr. Tornado"", T. Theodore Fujita of the University of Chicago.                 New EF Scale:     Old F-Scale:     Typical Damage:                     EF0 (65-85 mph)     F0 (65-73 mph)     Light damage . Peels surface off some roofs; some damage to gutters or siding; branches broken off trees; shallow-rooted trees pushed over.             EF1 (86-110 mph)     F1 (73-112 mph)     Moderate damage . Roofs severely stripped; mobile homes overturned or badly damaged; loss of exterior doors; windows and other glass broken.             EF2(111-135 mph)     F2 (113-157 mph)     Considerable damage . Roofs torn off well-constructed houses; foundations of frame homes shifted; mobile homes completely destroyed; large trees snapped or uprooted; light-object missiles generated; cars lifted off ground.             EF3 (136-165 mph)     F3 (158-206 mph)     Severe damage . Entire stories of well-constructed houses destroyed; severe damage to large buildings such as shopping malls; trains overturned; trees debarked; heavy cars lifted off the ground and thrown; structures with weak foundations blown away some distance.             EF4 (166-200 mph)     F4 (207-260 mph)     Devastating damage . Whole frame houses Well-constructed houses and whole frame houses completely leveled; cars thrown and small missiles generated.             EF5 (>200 mph)     F5 (261-318 mph)     Incredible damage . Strong frame houses leveled off foundations and swept away; automobile-sized missiles fly through the air in excess of 100 m (109 yd); high-rise buildings have significant structural deformation; incredible phenomena will occur.             EF No rating     F6-F12 (319 mph to speed of sound)     Inconceivable damage. Should a tornado with the maximum wind speed in excess of F5 occur, the extent and types of damage may not be conceived. A number of missiles such as iceboxes, water heaters, storage tanks, automoblies, etc.will create serious secondary damage on structures.                 What should I do to prepare myself for a tornado?     Continued vigilance and quick response to tornado watches and warnings are critical, since tornadoes can strike virtually anywhere at any time. Most tornadoes are abrupt at onset, short-lived and often obscured by rain or darkness. The best way to deal with them is preparedness. Every individual and business should have a tornado emergency plan for their homes and places of work, and should learn how to protect themselves in cars, open country, and other situations that may arise.     Remember if a tornado warning is issued for your area, a tornado is imminent. Know what to do--have an emergency plan to protect yourself and those for whom you are responsible. Quick response when a tornado approaches can save many lives. There may be only seconds in which to take action.     There are  5 Basic Steps  in the National Weather Service warning system. Every part of the system has to work for the greatest number of people to get the warning in time.             The Tornado Watch     Meteorologists using the latest in computers, radar and satellite data are always monitoring the weather elements. When a high probability of severe weather exists, a tornado or severe thunderstorm watch is issued. Watches may be issued hours before any severe storm hits the area. The forecasters at the National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Missouri use every tool available including satellite pictures, radar reports, and numerous weather charts to predict the areas where severe thunderstorms and tornadoes are likely to occur.             Spotters     Severe weather spotters are constantly being trained under the Skywarn training program. Spotting severe weatheris serious business and requires specific training. However, once an observer is trained in severe weather spotting procedures, they are one of the most reliable tools of the National Weather Service meteorologist. Spotters serve as the National Weather Service's eyes in the field.             Civil Defense and the State Police     Any information that the National Weather Service issues is relayed to individual cities and towns through state and local civil defense, and the State Police.             The Media     The vast majority of people are reached through the cooperation of the media. A direct line between the National Weather Service and local media offices insures that severe weather information is relayed quickly and broadcast within the shortest time possible.             The Users     Users include everyone within the severe thunderstorm or tornado warning area. We want to reach the greatest number of people possible and provide a concise, yet persuasive message of necessary action. Even if every other step in the warning system works, it does little good unless the users know what to do, and act.             What was the deadliest tornado outbreak in the U.S.?     The deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history occured on March 18, 1925. 747 people were killed and 2,027 were injured in Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana when several twisters touched down on this day. The largest of these tornadoes, named the ""Tri-State"", took 695 lives and was classified as an F5. It moved over 215 miles of land at 60-73 mph.     What was the longest path length of a tornado? What was the shortest?     The longest tornado path was reported to have traveled from Missouri to Indiana in 1917. It was on the ground for 7 hours and 20 minutes. Because there was no damage report filed, its difficult to know if this tornado actually stayed on the ground for the entire time, or if it was the result of several tornadoes. The shortest reported tornado was 7 feet long.     What are the strongest winds in a tornado?     Mobile Doppler radar reported one twister on May 3, 1999 as having winds as fast as 318 mph. The winds swirling around a tornado vortex have been reported to be on the range of 280-300 mph. Scientists have found that the strongest winds occur about 300 feet above the ground. Most tornadoes, however, fail to have wind speeds in excess of 113 mph.     Should I open my windows and doors during a tornado?     NO! Opening your windows and doors may in fact increase the damage to your house and make you suseptible to being struck by flying glass. Instead, use that time to find a safe spot under heavy furniture and away from windows. Any openings, including garage doors, that allow wind to enter a building increases the chance for damage.     Are the number of tornadoes increasing?     The number of tornadoes that occur each year is not increasing, but the number of spotted and reported tornadoes is. The reason for this is that more people live in or travel through tornado prone areas than used to. This has led to better communication and reportings of severe weather.     How are tornadoes detected?     In addition to the thousands of National Weather Service trained severe weather spotters, NEXRAD Doppler radars detect severe weather. These radars spot large scale rotation from which many tornadoes form. NEXRAD does not detect every tornado, but it is likely that they will provide advance warning for large twisters.                                                             Tornado Safety Rules                                                 We can do little to prevent a tornado from occurring, but by knowing the safety rules we can minimize the number of deaths and injuries.     A  tornado watch  means that tornado development is possible. Keep a watchful eye on the sky for threatening weather and stay tuned to radio and television and listen for weather bulletins.     A  tornado warning  means that a tornado has been sighted or indicated by radar. Persons in the path of the storm should seek shelter immediately - preferably in a storm cellar, underground excavation, or in a steel-framed or concrete reinforced building.     A  severe thunderstorm warning  means that either spotters or radar have indicated that severe weather is occuring, and is expected to be heading towards you soon. This warning is issued by the National Weather Service local office, and usually covers a few counties, lasting about an hour or so. A thunderstorm is classified as severe because it can contain hail three-quarter inches or larger, and/or wind gusts of 58 mph or higher, and/or a tornado. When a warning is issued, persons should remain indoors until the storm has passed.     In homes,the  basement  offers the greatest safety. Seek shelter under sturdy furniture if possible. In homes  without basements  take cover in the center part of the house, on the lowest floor, in a small room such as a closet or bathroom, or under sturdy furniture.  Stay away from windows!     In schools, hospitals, and shopping centers move to  pre-designated shelter areas . Interior hallways on lowest floors are best. If the building is  not of reinforced construction , go to a nearby one that is, or take cover outside on low, protected ground.  Stay out of auditoriums, gymnasiums, and other structures with wide free-span roofs.     In open country,  move away from the tornado's path at right angles . If there is not time to escape,lie flat in the nearest ditch or ravine.     In your car,  do not try to outrun a tornado . If available take shelter in a sturdy structure. Otherwise,  get in the nearest ditch or depression until the tornado passes .     Mobile homes are particularly vulnerable to overturning during strong winds and should be evacuated when strong winds or tornadoes are forecast. Damage can be minimized by securing trailers with cables anchored in concrete footing. Trailer parks should have some community storm shelters. If there is no shelter nearby,  leave the trailer park and take cover on low-protected ground.                                           For more information about tornadoes, visit the  NOAA Storm Prediction Center .

Tornado   A  tornado  is defined by the  Glossary of Meteorology  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [6]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [3]       Condensation funnel   A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to condense into a visible  condensation funnel . [4]  The tornado is the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud .   A  funnel cloud  is a visible condensation funnel with no associated strong winds at the surface. Not all funnel clouds evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [3]       Tornado family   Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family .  [7]       Tornado outbreak   Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak .

Etymology   The word ""tornado"" is an altered form of the  Spanish  word  tronada , which means ""thunderstorm"". This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology .

True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado   A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes.       Satellite tornado   A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [3]                A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .         Waterspout   A  waterspout  is officially defined by the US  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.    Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . [13]  They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. [13]  They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. [13]  They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys . [14]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous.                    A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on  May 22 ,  2004 .         Landspout   Landspout  is an unofficial term for a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage.

The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This tornado has no funnel cloud, however, the rotating dust cloud indicates that strong winds are occurring at the surface, and thus it is a true tornado. This was taken near  Alva, Oklahoma  in 1975.         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]  ""Tornado"" refers to the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     Funnel cloud   Main article:  funnel cloud   A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  funnel cloud  or  condensation funnel . [ 12 ]   There is some disagreement over the definition of ""funnel cloud"" and ""condensation funnel"". According to the  Glossary of Meteorology , a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus including most tornadoes under this definition. [ 13 ]  Among many meteorologists, a funnel cloud is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which  is not  associated with strong winds at the surface, and a ""condensation funnel"" is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud. [ 3 ]   Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, however, not all of these evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family   Main article:  tornado family   Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 14 ]     Tornado outbreak   Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence   Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado   Main article:  multiple vortex tornado   A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Satellite tornado   A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .       Main article:  waterspout   A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 20 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.       Main article:  landspout   A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado   Main article:  gustnado   A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 21 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .       Main article:  dust devil   A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]     Fire whirl   Main article:  fire whirls   Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 15 ]     Steam devil   Main article:  steam devil   A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 10 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 24 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 25 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 22 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 22 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 22 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 15 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 26 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 22 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 27 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 28 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 15 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 34 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 35 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 36 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 37 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 38 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 39 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 40 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 41 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum [ 42 ] , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 40 ] [ 43 ]  Little is yet understood, however.   Observed, also, are correlations with patterns of lightning activity, but these are not yet well understood. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. [ 44 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 45 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.       Further information:  Tornadogenesis     Supercell relationship   See also:  Supercell   Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 10 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 15 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 46 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.       Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage   The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 47 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 15 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 48 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 49 ]       Climatology   Main article:  Tornado climatology          Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 50 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 51 ] [ 52 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 50 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 55 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 15 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 56 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 15 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 62 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 63 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 64 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 65 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 66 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection   Main article:  Convective storm detection          A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 69 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 70 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 71 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 72 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 73 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 74 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 48 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 10 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 75 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 73 ]       Extremes   Main article:  Tornado records   The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 15 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 76 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 53 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 77 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 78 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 79 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 80 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 81 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .       Main article:  Tornado myths   One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 84 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 81 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 85 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 22 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 86 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 87 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 40 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

For other uses, see  Tornado (disambiguation) .          A tornado near  Anadarko, Oklahoma . The tornado itself is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  A tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister , and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term  cyclone . [ 8 ]  The term ""cyclone"" is used as a synonym for ""tornado"" in the often-aired 1939 film,  The Wizard of Oz . The term ""twister"" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 film  Twister .     Definitions          A tornado near  Seymour, Texas .              This tornado has no funnel cloud, however, the rotating dust cloud indicates that strong winds are occurring at the surface, and thus it is a true tornado. This was taken near  Alva, Oklahoma  in 1975.         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]  ""Tornado"" refers to the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     Funnel cloud   Main article:  funnel cloud   A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  funnel cloud  or  condensation funnel . [ 12 ]   There is some disagreement over the definition of ""funnel cloud"" and ""condensation funnel"". According to the  Glossary of Meteorology , a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus including most tornadoes under this definition. [ 13 ]  Among many meteorologists, a funnel cloud is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which  is not  associated with strong winds at the surface, and a ""condensation funnel"" is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud. [ 3 ]   Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, however, not all of these evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family   Main article:  tornado family   Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 14 ]     Tornado outbreak   Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence   Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado   Main article:  multiple vortex tornado   A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Satellite tornado   A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .       Main article:  waterspout   A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 20 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.       Main article:  landspout   A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado   Main article:  gustnado   A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 21 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .       Main article:  dust devil   A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]     Fire whirl   Main article:  fire whirls   Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 15 ]     Steam devil   Main article:  steam devil   A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 10 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 24 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 25 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 22 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 22 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 22 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 15 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 26 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 22 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 27 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 28 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 15 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 34 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 35 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 36 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 37 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 38 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 39 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 40 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 41 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum [ 42 ] , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 40 ] [ 43 ]  Little is yet understood, however.   Observed, also, are correlations with patterns of lightning activity, but these are not yet well understood. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. [ 44 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 45 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.       Further information:  Tornadogenesis     Supercell relationship   See also:  Supercell   Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 10 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 15 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 46 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.       Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage   The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 47 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 15 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 48 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 49 ]       Climatology   Main article:  Tornado climatology          Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 50 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 51 ] [ 52 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 50 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 55 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 15 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 56 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 15 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 62 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 63 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 64 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 65 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 66 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection   Main article:  Convective storm detection          A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 69 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 70 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 71 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 72 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 73 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 74 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 48 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 10 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 75 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 73 ]       Extremes   Main article:  Tornado records   The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 15 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 76 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 53 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 77 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 78 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 79 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 80 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 81 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .       Main article:  Tornado myths   One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 84 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 81 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 85 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 22 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 86 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 87 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 40 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

For other uses, see  Tornado (disambiguation) .          A tornado near  Anadarko, Oklahoma . The tornado itself is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  A tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister , and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term  cyclone . [ 8 ]  The term ""cyclone"" is used as a synonym for ""tornado"" in the often-aired 1939 film,  The Wizard of Oz . The term ""twister"" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 film  Twister .     Definitions          A tornado near  Seymour, Texas .              This tornado has no funnel cloud, however, the rotating dust cloud indicates that strong winds are occurring at the surface, and thus it is a true tornado. This was taken near  Alva, Oklahoma  in 1975.         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]  ""Tornado"" refers to the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     Funnel cloud   Main article:  funnel cloud   A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  funnel cloud  or  condensation funnel . [ 12 ]   There is some disagreement over the definition of ""funnel cloud"" and ""condensation funnel"". According to the  Glossary of Meteorology , a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus including most tornadoes under this definition. [ 13 ]  Among many meteorologists, a funnel cloud is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which  is not  associated with strong winds at the surface, and a ""condensation funnel"" is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud. [ 3 ]   Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, however, not all of these evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family   Main article:  tornado family   Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 14 ]     Tornado outbreak   Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence   Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado   Main article:  multiple vortex tornado   A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Satellite tornado   A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .       Main article:  waterspout   A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 20 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.       Main article:  landspout   A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado   Main article:  gustnado   A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 21 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .       Main article:  dust devil   A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]     Fire whirl   Main article:  fire whirls   Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 15 ]     Steam devil   Main article:  steam devil   A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 10 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 24 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 25 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 22 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 22 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 22 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 15 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 26 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 22 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 27 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 28 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 15 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 34 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 35 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 36 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 37 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 38 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 39 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 40 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 41 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum [ 42 ] , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 40 ] [ 43 ]  Little is yet understood, however.   Observed, also, are correlations with patterns of lightning activity, but these are not yet well understood. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. [ 44 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 45 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.       Further information:  Tornadogenesis     Supercell relationship   See also:  Supercell   Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 10 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 15 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 46 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.       Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage   The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 47 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 15 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 48 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 49 ]       Climatology   Main article:  Tornado climatology          Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 50 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 51 ] [ 52 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 50 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 55 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 15 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 56 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 15 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 62 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 63 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 64 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 65 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 66 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection   Main article:  Convective storm detection          A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 69 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 70 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 71 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 72 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 73 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 74 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 48 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 10 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 75 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 73 ]       Extremes   Main article:  Tornado records   The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 15 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 76 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 53 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 77 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 78 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 79 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 80 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 81 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .       Main article:  Tornado myths   One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 84 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 81 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 85 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 22 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 86 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 87 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 40 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

For other uses, see  Tornado (disambiguation) .          A tornado near  Anadarko, Oklahoma . The tornado itself is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  A tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister , and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term  cyclone . [ 8 ]  The term ""cyclone"" is used as a synonym for ""tornado"" in the often-aired 1939 film,  The Wizard of Oz . The term ""twister"" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 film  Twister .     Definitions          A tornado near  Seymour, Texas .              This tornado has no funnel cloud, however, the rotating dust cloud indicates that strong winds are occurring at the surface, and thus it is a true tornado. This was taken near  Alva, Oklahoma  in 1975.         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]  ""Tornado"" refers to the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     Funnel cloud   Main article:  funnel cloud   A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  funnel cloud  or  condensation funnel . [ 12 ]   There is some disagreement over the definition of ""funnel cloud"" and ""condensation funnel"". According to the  Glossary of Meteorology , a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus including most tornadoes under this definition. [ 13 ]  Among many meteorologists, a funnel cloud is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which  is not  associated with strong winds at the surface, and a ""condensation funnel"" is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud. [ 3 ]   Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, however, not all of these evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family   Main article:  tornado family   Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 14 ]     Tornado outbreak   Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence   Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado   Main article:  multiple vortex tornado   A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Satellite tornado   A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .       Main article:  waterspout   A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 20 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.       Main article:  landspout   A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado   Main article:  gustnado   A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 21 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .       Main article:  dust devil   A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]     Fire whirl   Main article:  fire whirls   Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 15 ]     Steam devil   Main article:  steam devil   A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 10 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 24 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 25 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 22 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 22 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 22 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 15 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 26 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 22 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 27 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 28 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 15 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 34 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 35 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 36 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 37 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 38 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 39 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 40 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 41 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum [ 42 ] , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 40 ] [ 43 ]  Little is yet understood, however.   Observed, also, are correlations with patterns of lightning activity, but these are not yet well understood. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. [ 44 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 45 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.       Further information:  Tornadogenesis     Supercell relationship   See also:  Supercell   Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 10 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 15 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 46 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.       Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage   The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 47 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 15 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 48 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 49 ]       Climatology   Main article:  Tornado climatology          Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 50 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 51 ] [ 52 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 50 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 55 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 15 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 56 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 15 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 62 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 63 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 64 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 65 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 66 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection   Main article:  Convective storm detection          A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 69 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 70 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 71 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 72 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 73 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 74 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 48 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 10 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 75 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 73 ]       Extremes   Main article:  Tornado records   The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 15 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 76 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 53 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 77 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 78 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 79 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 80 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 81 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .       Main article:  Tornado myths   One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 84 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 81 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 85 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 22 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 86 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 87 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 40 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

For other uses, see  Tornado (disambiguation) .          A tornado near  Anadarko, Oklahoma . The tornado itself is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  A tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister , and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term  cyclone . [ 8 ]  The term ""cyclone"" is used as a synonym for ""tornado"" in the often-aired 1939 film,  The Wizard of Oz . The term ""twister"" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 film  Twister .     Definitions          A tornado near  Seymour, Texas .              This tornado has no funnel cloud, however, the rotating dust cloud indicates that strong winds are occurring at the surface, and thus it is a true tornado. This was taken near  Alva, Oklahoma  in 1975.         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]  ""Tornado"" refers to the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     Funnel cloud   Main article:  funnel cloud   A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  funnel cloud  or  condensation funnel . [ 12 ]   There is some disagreement over the definition of ""funnel cloud"" and ""condensation funnel"". According to the  Glossary of Meteorology , a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus including most tornadoes under this definition. [ 13 ]  Among many meteorologists, a funnel cloud is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which  is not  associated with strong winds at the surface, and a ""condensation funnel"" is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud. [ 3 ]   Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, however, not all of these evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family   Main article:  tornado family   Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 14 ]     Tornado outbreak   Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence   Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado   Main article:  multiple vortex tornado   A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Satellite tornado   A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .       Main article:  waterspout   A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 20 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.       Main article:  landspout   A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado   Main article:  gustnado   A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 21 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .       Main article:  dust devil   A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]     Fire whirl   Main article:  fire whirls   Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 15 ]     Steam devil   Main article:  steam devil   A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 10 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 24 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 25 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 22 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 22 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 22 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 15 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 26 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 22 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 27 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 28 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 15 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 34 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 35 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 36 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 37 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 38 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 39 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 40 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 41 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum [ 42 ] , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 40 ] [ 43 ]  Little is yet understood, however.   Observed, also, are correlations with patterns of lightning activity, but these are not yet well understood. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. [ 44 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 45 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.       Further information:  Tornadogenesis     Supercell relationship   See also:  Supercell   Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 10 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 15 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 46 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.       Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage   The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 47 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 15 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 48 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 49 ]       Climatology   Main article:  Tornado climatology          Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 50 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 51 ] [ 52 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 50 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 55 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 15 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 56 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 15 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 62 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 63 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 64 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 65 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 66 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection   Main article:  Convective storm detection          A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 69 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 70 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 71 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 72 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 73 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 74 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 48 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 10 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 75 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 73 ]       Extremes   Main article:  Tornado records   The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 15 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 76 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 53 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 77 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 78 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 79 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 80 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 81 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .       Main article:  Tornado myths   One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 84 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 81 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 85 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 22 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 86 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 87 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 40 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

For other uses, see  Tornado (disambiguation) .          A tornado near  Anadarko, Oklahoma . The tornado itself is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  A tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister , and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term  cyclone . [ 8 ]  The term ""cyclone"" is used as a synonym for ""tornado"" in the often-aired 1939 film,  The Wizard of Oz . The term ""twister"" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 film  Twister .     Definitions          A tornado near  Seymour, Texas .              This tornado has no funnel cloud, however, the rotating dust cloud indicates that strong winds are occurring at the surface, and thus it is a true tornado. This was taken near  Alva, Oklahoma  in 1975.         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]  ""Tornado"" refers to the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     Funnel cloud   Main article:  funnel cloud   A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  funnel cloud  or  condensation funnel . [ 12 ]   There is some disagreement over the definition of ""funnel cloud"" and ""condensation funnel"". According to the  Glossary of Meteorology , a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus including most tornadoes under this definition. [ 13 ]  Among many meteorologists, a funnel cloud is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which  is not  associated with strong winds at the surface, and a ""condensation funnel"" is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud. [ 3 ]   Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, however, not all of these evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family   Main article:  tornado family   Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 14 ]     Tornado outbreak   Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence   Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado   Main article:  multiple vortex tornado   A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Satellite tornado   A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .       Main article:  waterspout   A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 20 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.       Main article:  landspout   A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado   Main article:  gustnado   A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 21 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .       Main article:  dust devil   A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]     Fire whirl   Main article:  fire whirls   Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 15 ]     Steam devil   Main article:  steam devil   A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 10 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 24 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 25 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 22 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 22 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 22 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 15 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 26 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 22 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 27 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 28 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 15 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 34 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 35 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 36 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 37 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 38 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 39 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 40 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 41 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum [ 42 ] , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 40 ] [ 43 ]  Little is yet understood, however.   Observed, also, are correlations with patterns of lightning activity, but these are not yet well understood. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. [ 44 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 45 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.       Further information:  Tornadogenesis     Supercell relationship   See also:  Supercell   Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 10 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 15 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 46 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.       Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage   The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 47 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 15 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 48 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 49 ]       Climatology   Main article:  Tornado climatology          Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 50 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 51 ] [ 52 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 50 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 55 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 15 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 56 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 15 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 62 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 63 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 64 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 65 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 66 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection   Main article:  Convective storm detection          A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 69 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 70 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 71 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 72 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 73 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 74 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 48 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 10 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 75 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 73 ]       Extremes   Main article:  Tornado records   The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 15 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 76 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 53 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 77 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 78 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 79 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 80 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 81 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .       Main article:  Tornado myths   One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 84 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 81 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 85 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 22 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 86 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 87 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 40 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

For other uses, see  Tornado (disambiguation) .          A tornado near  Anadarko, Oklahoma . The tornado itself is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  A tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister , and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term  cyclone . [ 8 ]  The term ""cyclone"" is used as a synonym for ""tornado"" in the often-aired 1939 film,  The Wizard of Oz . The term ""twister"" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 film  Twister .     Definitions          A tornado near  Seymour, Texas .              This tornado has no funnel cloud, however, the rotating dust cloud indicates that strong winds are occurring at the surface, and thus it is a true tornado. This was taken near  Alva, Oklahoma  in 1975.         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]  ""Tornado"" refers to the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     Funnel cloud   Main article:  funnel cloud   A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  funnel cloud  or  condensation funnel . [ 12 ]   There is some disagreement over the definition of ""funnel cloud"" and ""condensation funnel"". According to the  Glossary of Meteorology , a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus including most tornadoes under this definition. [ 13 ]  Among many meteorologists, a funnel cloud is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which  is not  associated with strong winds at the surface, and a ""condensation funnel"" is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud. [ 3 ]   Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, however, not all of these evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family   Main article:  tornado family   Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 14 ]     Tornado outbreak   Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence   Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado   Main article:  multiple vortex tornado   A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Satellite tornado   A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .       Main article:  waterspout   A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 20 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.       Main article:  landspout   A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado   Main article:  gustnado   A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 21 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .       Main article:  dust devil   A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]     Fire whirl   Main article:  fire whirls   Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 15 ]     Steam devil   Main article:  steam devil   A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 10 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 24 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 25 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 22 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 22 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 22 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 15 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 26 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 22 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 27 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 28 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 15 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 34 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 35 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 36 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 37 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 38 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 39 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 40 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 41 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum [ 42 ] , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 40 ] [ 43 ]  Little is yet understood, however.   Observed, also, are correlations with patterns of lightning activity, but these are not yet well understood. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. [ 44 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 45 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.       Further information:  Tornadogenesis     Supercell relationship   See also:  Supercell   Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 10 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 15 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 46 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.       Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage   The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 47 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 15 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 48 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 49 ]       Climatology   Main article:  Tornado climatology          Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 50 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 51 ] [ 52 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 50 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 55 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 15 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 56 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 15 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 62 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 63 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 64 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 65 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 66 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection   Main article:  Convective storm detection          A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 69 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 70 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 71 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 72 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 73 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 74 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 48 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 10 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 75 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 73 ]       Extremes   Main article:  Tornado records   The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 15 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 76 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 53 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 77 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 78 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 79 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 80 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 81 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .       Main article:  Tornado myths   One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 84 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 81 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 85 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 22 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 86 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 87 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 40 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

For other uses, see  Tornado (disambiguation) .          A tornado near  Anadarko, Oklahoma . The tornado itself is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  A tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister , and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term  cyclone . [ 8 ]  The term ""cyclone"" is used as a synonym for ""tornado"" in the often-aired 1939 film,  The Wizard of Oz . The term ""twister"" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 film  Twister .     Definitions          A tornado near  Seymour, Texas .         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]     Condensation funnel   A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  condensation funnel . [ 10 ]  The tornado is the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]     Funnel cloud       Main article:  funnel cloud       A  funnel cloud  is a visible condensation funnel with no associated strong winds at the surface. Not all funnel clouds evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family       Main article:  tornado family       Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 13 ]     Tornado outbreak       Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence       Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado       Main article:  multiple vortex tornado       A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 11 ]     Satellite tornado       Main article:  satellite tornado       A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .           Main article:  waterspout       A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 19 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.           Main article:  landspout       A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 11 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado       Main article:  gustnado       A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 20 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .           Main article:  dust devil       A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]     Fire whirl       Main article:  fire whirls       Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 14 ]     Steam devil       Main article:  steam devil       A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 11 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 23 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 24 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 21 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 21 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 21 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 14 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 25 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 21 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 26 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 27 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 14 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 31 ] [ 32 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 33 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 34 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 35 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 36 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 37 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 38 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 39 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 40 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 39 ] [ 41 ]  The effects vary, mostly with little observed consistency.   Correlations with patterns of  lightning  activity have also been observed, but little in way of consistent correlations have been advanced. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms, and some tornadic cells never contain lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance in positive polarity CG discharges. [ 42 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), though there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past, and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 43 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.         Further information:  Tornadogenesis       Supercell relationship     See also:  Supercell     Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 11 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 14 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 44 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.           Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage       The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 45 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 14 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 46 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 47 ]       Climatology       Main article:  Tornado climatology              Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 48 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 49 ] [ 50 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 48 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 53 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 14 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 54 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 14 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 60 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 61 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 62 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 63 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 64 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 65 ] [ 66 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection       Main article:  Convective storm detection              A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 67 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 68 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 69 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 70 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 71 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 72 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 46 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 11 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 73 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 71 ]       Extremes       Main article:  Tornado records       The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 14 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 74 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 51 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 75 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 76 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 77 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 78 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 79 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .           Main article:  Tornado myths       One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 80 ] [ 81 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 82 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 79 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 80 ] [ 81 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 83 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 21 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 84 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 85 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 39 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

For other uses, see  Tornado (disambiguation) .          A tornado near  Anadarko, Oklahoma . The tornado itself is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  A tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister , and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term  cyclone . [ 8 ]  The term ""cyclone"" is used as a synonym for ""tornado"" in the often-aired 1939 film,  The Wizard of Oz . The term ""twister"" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 film  Twister .     Definitions          A tornado near  Seymour, Texas .         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]     Condensation funnel   A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  condensation funnel . [ 10 ]  The tornado is the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]     Funnel cloud       Main article:  funnel cloud       A  funnel cloud  is a visible condensation funnel with no associated strong winds at the surface. Not all funnel clouds evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family       Main article:  tornado family       Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 13 ]     Tornado outbreak       Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence       Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado       Main article:  multiple vortex tornado       A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 11 ]     Satellite tornado       Main article:  satellite tornado       A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .           Main article:  waterspout       A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 19 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.           Main article:  landspout       A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 11 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado       Main article:  gustnado       A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 20 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .           Main article:  dust devil       A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]     Fire whirl       Main article:  fire whirls       Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 14 ]     Steam devil       Main article:  steam devil       A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 11 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 23 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 24 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 21 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 21 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 21 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 14 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 25 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 21 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 26 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 27 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 14 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 31 ] [ 32 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 33 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 34 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 35 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 36 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 37 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 38 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 39 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 40 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 39 ] [ 41 ]  The effects vary, mostly with little observed consistency.   Correlations with patterns of  lightning  activity have also been observed, but little in way of consistent correlations have been advanced. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms, and some tornadic cells never contain lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance in positive polarity CG discharges. [ 42 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), though there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past, and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 43 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.         Further information:  Tornadogenesis       Supercell relationship     See also:  Supercell     Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 11 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 14 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 44 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.           Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage       The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 45 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 14 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 46 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 47 ]       Climatology       Main article:  Tornado climatology              Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 48 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 49 ] [ 50 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 48 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 53 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 14 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 54 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 14 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 60 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 61 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 62 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 63 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 64 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 65 ] [ 66 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection       Main article:  Convective storm detection              A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 67 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 68 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 69 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 70 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 71 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 72 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 46 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 11 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 73 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 71 ]       Extremes       Main article:  Tornado records       The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 14 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 74 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 51 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 75 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 76 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 77 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 78 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 79 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .           Main article:  Tornado myths       One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 80 ] [ 81 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 82 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 79 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 80 ] [ 81 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 83 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 21 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 84 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 85 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 39 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

For other uses, see  Tornado (disambiguation) .          A tornado near  Anadarko, Oklahoma . The tornado itself is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  A tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister , and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term  cyclone . [ 8 ]  The term ""cyclone"" is used as a synonym for ""tornado"" in the often-aired 1939 film,  The Wizard of Oz . The term ""twister"" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 film  Twister .     Definitions          A tornado near  Seymour, Texas .         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]     Condensation funnel   A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  condensation funnel . [ 10 ]  The tornado is the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]     Funnel cloud       Main article:  funnel cloud       A  funnel cloud  is a visible condensation funnel with no associated strong winds at the surface. Not all funnel clouds evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family       Main article:  tornado family       Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 13 ]     Tornado outbreak       Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence       Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado       Main article:  multiple vortex tornado       A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 11 ]     Satellite tornado       Main article:  satellite tornado       A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .           Main article:  waterspout       A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 19 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.           Main article:  landspout       A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 11 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado       Main article:  gustnado       A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 20 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .           Main article:  dust devil       A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]     Fire whirl       Main article:  fire whirls       Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 14 ]     Steam devil       Main article:  steam devil       A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 11 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 23 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 24 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 21 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 21 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 21 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 14 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 25 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 21 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 26 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 27 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 14 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 31 ] [ 32 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 33 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 34 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 35 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 36 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 37 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 38 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 39 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 40 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 39 ] [ 41 ]  The effects vary, mostly with little observed consistency.   Correlations with patterns of  lightning  activity have also been observed, but little in way of consistent correlations have been advanced. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms, and some tornadic cells never contain lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance in positive polarity CG discharges. [ 42 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), though there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past, and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 43 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.         Further information:  Tornadogenesis       Supercell relationship     See also:  Supercell     Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 11 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 14 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 44 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.           Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage       The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 45 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 14 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 46 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 47 ]       Climatology       Main article:  Tornado climatology              Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 48 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 49 ] [ 50 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 48 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 53 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 14 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 54 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 14 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 60 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 61 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 62 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 63 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 64 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 65 ] [ 66 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection       Main article:  Convective storm detection              A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 67 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 68 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 69 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 70 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 71 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 72 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 46 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 11 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 73 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 71 ]       Extremes       Main article:  Tornado records       The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 14 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 74 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 51 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 75 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 76 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 77 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 78 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 79 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .           Main article:  Tornado myths       One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 80 ] [ 81 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 82 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 79 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 80 ] [ 81 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 83 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 21 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 84 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 85 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 39 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

For other uses, see  Tornado (disambiguation) .          A tornado near  Anadarko, Oklahoma . The tornado itself is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  A tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister , and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term  cyclone . [ 8 ]  The term ""cyclone"" is used as a synonym for ""tornado"" in the often-aired 1939 film,  The Wizard of Oz . The term ""twister"" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 film  Twister .     Definitions          A tornado near  Seymour, Texas .              This tornado has no funnel cloud, however, the rotating dust cloud indicates that strong winds are occurring at the surface, and thus it is a true tornado. This was taken near  Alva, Oklahoma  in 1975.         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]  ""Tornado"" refers to the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     Funnel cloud   Main article:  funnel cloud   A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  funnel cloud  or  condensation funnel . [ 12 ]   There is some disagreement over the definition of ""funnel cloud"" and ""condensation funnel"". According to the  Glossary of Meteorology , a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus including most tornadoes under this definition. [ 13 ]  Among many meteorologists, a funnel cloud is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which  is not  associated with strong winds at the surface, and a ""condensation funnel"" is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud. [ 3 ]   Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, however, not all of these evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family   Main article:  tornado family   Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 14 ]     Tornado outbreak   Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence   Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado   Main article:  multiple vortex tornado   A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Satellite tornado   A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .       Main article:  waterspout   A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 20 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.       Main article:  landspout   A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado   Main article:  gustnado   A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 21 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .       Main article:  dust devil   A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]     Fire whirl   Main article:  fire whirls   Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 15 ]     Steam devil   Main article:  steam devil   A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 10 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 24 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 25 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 22 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 22 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 22 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 15 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 26 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 22 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 27 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 28 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 15 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 34 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 35 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 36 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 37 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 38 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 39 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 40 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 41 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum [ 42 ] , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 40 ] [ 43 ]  Little is yet understood, however.   Observed, also, are correlations with patterns of lightning activity, but these are not yet well understood. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. [ 44 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 45 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.       Further information:  Tornadogenesis     Supercell relationship   See also:  Supercell   Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 10 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 15 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 46 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.       Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage   The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 47 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 15 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 48 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 49 ]       Climatology   Main article:  Tornado climatology          Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 50 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 51 ] [ 52 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 50 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 55 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 15 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 56 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 15 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 62 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 63 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 64 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 65 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 66 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection   Main article:  Convective storm detection          A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 69 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 70 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 71 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 72 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 73 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 74 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 48 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 10 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 75 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 73 ]       Extremes   Main article:  Tornado records   The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 15 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 76 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 53 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 77 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 78 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 79 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 80 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 81 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .       Main article:  Tornado myths   One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 84 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 81 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 85 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 22 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 86 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 87 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 40 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

For other uses, see  Tornado (disambiguation) .          A tornado near  Anadarko, Oklahoma . The tornado itself is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  A tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister , and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term  cyclone . [ 8 ]  The term ""cyclone"" is used as a synonym for ""tornado"" in the often-aired 1939 film,  The Wizard of Oz . The term ""twister"" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 film  Twister .     Definitions          A tornado near  Seymour, Texas .              This tornado has no funnel cloud, however, the rotating dust cloud indicates that strong winds are occurring at the surface, and thus it is a true tornado. This was taken near  Alva, Oklahoma  in 1975.         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]  ""Tornado"" refers to the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     Funnel cloud       Main article:  funnel cloud       A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  funnel cloud  or  condensation funnel . [ 12 ]   There is some disagreement over the definition of ""funnel cloud"" and ""condensation funnel"". According to the  Glossary of Meteorology , a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus including most tornadoes under this definition. [ 13 ]  Among many meteorologists, a funnel cloud is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which  is not  associated with strong winds at the surface, and a ""condensation funnel"" is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud. [ 3 ]   Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, however, not all of these evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family       Main article:  tornado family       Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 14 ]     Tornado outbreak       Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence       Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado       Main article:  multiple vortex tornado       A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Satellite tornado   A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .           Main article:  waterspout       A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 20 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.           Main article:  landspout       A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado       Main article:  gustnado       A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 21 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .           Main article:  dust devil       A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]     Fire whirl       Main article:  fire whirls       Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 15 ]     Steam devil       Main article:  steam devil       A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 10 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 24 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 25 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 22 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 22 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 22 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 15 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 26 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 22 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 27 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 28 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 15 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 34 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 35 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 36 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 37 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 38 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 39 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 40 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 41 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum [ 42 ] , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 40 ] [ 43 ]  Little is yet understood, however.   Observed, also, are correlations with patterns of lightning activity, but these are not yet well understood. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. [ 44 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 45 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.         Further information:  Tornadogenesis       Supercell relationship     See also:  Supercell     Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 10 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 15 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 46 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.           Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage       The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 47 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 15 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 48 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 49 ]       Climatology       Main article:  Tornado climatology              Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 50 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 51 ] [ 52 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 50 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 55 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 15 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 56 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 15 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 62 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 63 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 64 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 65 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 66 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection       Main article:  Convective storm detection              A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 69 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 70 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 71 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 72 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 73 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 74 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 48 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 10 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 75 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 73 ]       Extremes       Main article:  Tornado records       The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 15 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 76 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 53 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 77 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 78 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 79 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 80 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 81 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .           Main article:  Tornado myths       One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 84 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 81 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 85 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 22 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 86 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 87 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 40 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

For other uses, see  Tornado (disambiguation) .          A tornado near  Anadarko, Oklahoma . The tornado itself is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  A tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister , and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term  cyclone . [ 8 ]  The term ""cyclone"" is used as a synonym for ""tornado"" in the often-aired 1939 film,  The Wizard of Oz . The term ""twister"" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 film  Twister .     Definitions          A tornado near  Seymour, Texas .              This tornado has no funnel cloud, however, the rotating dust cloud indicates that strong winds are occurring at the surface, and thus it is a true tornado. This was taken near  Alva, Oklahoma  in 1975.         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]  ""Tornado"" refers to the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     Funnel cloud       Main article:  funnel cloud       A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  funnel cloud  or  condensation funnel . [ 12 ]   There is some disagreement over the definition of ""funnel cloud"" and ""condensation funnel"". According to the  Glossary of Meteorology , a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus including most tornadoes under this definition. [ 13 ]  Among many meteorologists, a funnel cloud is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which  is not  associated with strong winds at the surface, and a ""condensation funnel"" is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud. [ 3 ]   Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, however, not all of these evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family       Main article:  tornado family       Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 14 ]     Tornado outbreak       Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence       Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado       Main article:  multiple vortex tornado       A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Satellite tornado   A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .           Main article:  waterspout       A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 20 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.           Main article:  landspout       A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado       Main article:  gustnado       A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 21 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .           Main article:  dust devil       A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]     Fire whirl       Main article:  fire whirls       Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 15 ]     Steam devil       Main article:  steam devil       A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 10 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 24 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 25 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 22 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 22 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 22 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 15 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 26 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 22 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 27 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 28 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 15 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 34 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 35 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 36 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 37 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 38 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 39 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 40 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 41 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum [ 42 ] , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 40 ] [ 43 ]  Little is yet understood, however.   Observed, also, are correlations with patterns of lightning activity, but these are not yet well understood. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. [ 44 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 45 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.         Further information:  Tornadogenesis       Supercell relationship     See also:  Supercell     Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 10 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 15 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 46 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.           Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage       The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 47 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 15 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 48 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 49 ]       Climatology       Main article:  Tornado climatology              Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 50 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 51 ] [ 52 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 50 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 55 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 15 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 56 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 15 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 62 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 63 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 64 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 65 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 66 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection       Main article:  Convective storm detection              A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 69 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 70 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 71 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 72 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 73 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 74 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 48 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 10 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 75 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 73 ]       Extremes       Main article:  Tornado records       The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 15 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 76 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 53 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 77 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 78 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 79 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 80 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 81 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .           Main article:  Tornado myths       One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 84 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 81 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 85 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 22 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 86 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 87 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 40 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

For other uses, see  Tornado (disambiguation) .          A tornado near  Anadarko, Oklahoma . The tornado itself is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a  translucent  dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface       A  tornado  is a violent, rotating column of air which is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a  cumulonimbus cloud  or, in rare cases, the base of a  cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible  condensation   funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of  debris .   Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 mph (64 km/h) and 110 mph (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (75 m) across, and travel a few miles (several  kilometers ) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States. [ 4 ]  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America,  Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.

This in turn was taken from the  Latin   tonare , meaning ""to  thunder "". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish  tronada  and  tornar  (""to turn""); however, this may be a  folk etymology . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  A tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister , and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term  cyclone . [ 8 ]  The term ""cyclone"" is used as a synonym for ""tornado"" in the often-aired 1939 film,  The Wizard of Oz . The term ""twister"" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 film  Twister .     Definitions          A tornado near  Seymour, Texas .              This tornado has no funnel cloud, however, the rotating dust cloud indicates that strong winds are occurring at the surface, and thus it is a true tornado. This was taken near  Alva, Oklahoma  in 1975.         Tornado   The  Glossary of Meteorology  defines a  tornado  as ""a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a  cumuliform cloud  or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a  funnel cloud ..."" [ 9 ]  In practice, for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. [ 3 ]  ""Tornado"" refers to the  vortex  of  wind , not the condensation  cloud . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     Funnel cloud       Main article:  funnel cloud       A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (see  Bernoulli's principle ) and rapid rotation (due to  cyclostrophic  balance) usually causes  water vapor  in the air to become visible as a  funnel cloud  or  condensation funnel . [ 12 ]   There is some disagreement over the definition of ""funnel cloud"" and ""condensation funnel"". According to the  Glossary of Meteorology , a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus including most tornadoes under this definition. [ 13 ]  Among many meteorologists, a funnel cloud is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which  is not  associated with strong winds at the surface, and a ""condensation funnel"" is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud. [ 3 ]   Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, however, not all of these evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. [ 3 ]     Tornado family       Main article:  tornado family       Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm are referred to as a  tornado family . [ 14 ]     Tornado outbreak       Main articles:  tornado outbreak  and  tornado outbreak sequence       Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a  tornado outbreak , although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a  tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an  extended tornado outbreak . [ 9 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]     Types          A  multiple-vortex   tornado  outside of  Dallas, Texas  on April 2, 1957.         True tornadoes     Multiple vortex tornado       Main article:  multiple vortex tornado       A  multiple vortex tornado  is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Satellite tornado   A  satellite tornado  is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "" orbit "" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel. [ 3 ]     Waterspout          A waterspout near the  Florida Keys .           Main article:  waterspout       A  waterspout  is defined by the  National Weather Service  simply as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish ""fair weather"" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts.     Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar in dynamics to  dust devils  and  landspouts . They form at the bases of  cumulus congestus  cloud towers in tropical and semitropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth  laminar  walls, and typically travel very slowly, if at all. They occur most commonly in the  Florida Keys  and in the northern  Adriatic Sea . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]   Tornadic waterspouts are more literally ""tornadoes over water"". They can form over water like  mesocyclonic  tornadoes, or be a land tornado which crosses onto water. Since they form from  severe thunderstorms  and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are considered far more dangerous. [ 20 ]       Landspout          A landspout near  North Platte, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004.           Main article:  landspout       A  landspout  (officially known as a  dust-tube tornado ) is a tornado not associated with a  mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as essentially a ""fair weather waterspout on land"". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground. Landspouts also create a distinctively  laminar  cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they still produce strong winds and may cause serious damage. [ 3 ] [ 10 ]     Tornado-like circulations     Gustnado       Main article:  gustnado       A  gustnado  (gust front tornado) is a small, vertical swirl associated with a  gust front  or  downburst . Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a  thunderstorm  is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a ""rolling"" effect (often exemplified through a  roll cloud ). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned horizontally (or diagonally) and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. [ 3 ] [ 21 ]  They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage. It is also worth noting that since they are absent of any Coriolis influence from a mesocyclone, they seem to be alternately  cyclonic  and  anticyclonic  without preference.     Dust devil          Dust devil in  Johnsonville, South Carolina .           Main article:  dust devil       A  dust devil  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level  wind shear , the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any actual cloud. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage, especially in  arid  areas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]     Fire whirl       Main article:  fire whirls       Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense  wildfires  and are called  fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  pyrocumulus  or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. However, they can produce significant damage. [ 15 ]     Steam devil       Main article:  steam devil       A  steam devil  is a term describing a  rotating   updraft  that involves  steam  or  smoke . A steam devil is very rare, but they mainly form from smoke emitting from a  power plant   smokestack .  Hot springs  and  deserts  may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. There have also been reports of cold air steam devils as well.     Characteristics          A  wedge tornado , nearly a mile wide. This tornado hit  Binger, Oklahoma .              A  rope tornado  in its dissipating stage.  Tecumseh, OK .         Shape   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  funnel , a few hundred yards (a few hundred meters) across, with a small  cloud  of  debris  near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.   Small, relatively weak  landspouts  may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. [ 10 ]  A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  wedges  stuck into the ground, and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges . The  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges. [ 24 ]   Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be  roping out , or becoming a  rope tornado . Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel. [ 25 ]   In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them. [ 22 ]     Size   In the United States, on average tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stay on the ground for 5 miles (8 km). [ 22 ]  Yet, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. A tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long. [ 22 ]  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A  tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska  on May 22, 2004 was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground. [ 2 ]   In terms of path length, the  Tri-State Tornado , which affected parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. [ 15 ]  In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought. [ 26 ]     Appearance   Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the  Great Plains  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white. [ 22 ]            Photographs of the  Waurika, Oklahoma  tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is  front-lit , with the sun behind the east-facing  camera , so the funnel appears nearly white. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the tornado is  back-lit , with the sun behind the clouds. [ 27 ]       Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "" back-lit "" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink. [ 28 ] [ 8 ]   Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only  weather radar  observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's  rain-free base , or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. [ 15 ]  Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.   There is mounting evidence, including  Doppler On Wheels  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the  eye  of  tropical cyclones . This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, since the light would be blocked by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]     Rotation   Tornadoes normally rotate  cyclonically  in direction (counterclockwise in the  northern hemisphere , clockwise in the  southern ). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is inconsequential, as indicated by their large  Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Low-level  mesocyclones  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment. [ 34 ]   Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnadoes rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending  rear flank downdraft  in a cyclonic supercell. [ 35 ]  However, on rare occasions,  anticyclonic tornadoes  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornadoeither as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell. [ 36 ]     Sound and seismology   Tornadoes emit widely on the  acoustics   spectrum  and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported throughout time, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight  train , rushing rapids or  waterfall , a  jet engine  from close proximity, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.   The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent  turbulent   eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable  bees  or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of noise. [ 37 ]   Since many tornadoes are audible only in very close proximity, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. And, any strong, damaging wind, even a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound. [ 38 ]          An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  Earth System Research Laboratory 's  Infrasound Program .       Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  infrasonic  signatures. [ 39 ]  Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. [ 40 ]  Tornadoes also produce a detectable  seismic  signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process. [ 41 ]     Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects   Tornadoes emit on the  electromagnetic spectrum , for example, with  sferics  and  E-field  effects detected. [ 40 ] [ 42 ]  The effects vary, mostly with little observed consistency.   Correlations with patterns of  lightning  activity have also been observed, but little in way of consistent correlations have been advanced. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms, and some tornadic cells never contain lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, very intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance in positive polarity CG discharges. [ 43 ]   Electromagnetics  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a  thermodynamic  phenomenon), though there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.   Luminosity  has been reported in the past, and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and  power flashes  from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever been recorded.   In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as  temperature ,  moisture , and  pressure . For example, on June 24, 2003 near  Manchester, South Dakota , a probe measured a 100  mbar  ( hPa ) (2.95  inHg ) pressure deficit. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850  mbar  ( hPa ) (25.10  inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado. [ 44 ]     Life cycle          A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage. This tornado, near  Dimmitt, Texas , was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.         Further information:  Tornadogenesis       Supercell relationship     See also:  Supercell     Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as  supercells . Supercells contain  mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 16 miles (210 km) across. Most intense tornadoes ( EF3  to  EF5  on the  Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.   Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. [ 10 ]  That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the  rear flank downdraft  (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.     Formation   As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating  wall cloud . As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.     Maturity   Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the  mature stage . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.     Demise   As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the  dissipating stage ; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 15 ]  Even though the tornado is dissipating, the tornado is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.   As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop  cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.   Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one. [ 45 ]       Intensity and damage          An example of  EF1  damage. Here, the roof has been substantially damaged, and the  garage door  blown outwards, but the walls and supporting structures are still intact.           Main article:  Tornado intensity and damage       The  Fujita scale  and the  Enhanced Fujita Scale  rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by  expert elicitation ) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An  EF0  tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an  EF5  tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large  skyscrapers . The similar  TORRO scale  ranges from a  T0  for extremely weak tornadoes to  T11  for the most powerful known tornadoes.  Doppler   radar  data,  photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.   Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. [ 46 ]  In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from  subvortices . [ 15 ]   In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are  EF0  and  EF1  ( T0  through  T3 ) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes( EF4 ,  T8  or stronger). [ 47 ]   Outside the United States, areas in south-central Asia, and perhaps portions of southeastern South America and southern Africa, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively. [ 48 ]       Climatology       Main article:  Tornado climatology              Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading.              Intense tornado activity in the United States. The darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as  Tornado Alley .       The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, about four times more than estimated in all of Europe, not including waterspouts. [ 49 ]  This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a relatively large continent that extends from the  tropical  south into  arctic  areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the  middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur, the  Rocky Mountains  block moisture and atmospheric flow, allowing drier air at mid-levels of the  troposphere , and causing  cyclogenesis  downstream to the east of the mountains. The desert Southwest also feeds drier air and the  dry line , while the  Gulf of Mexico  fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for many collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms many times a year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  central United States  known as  Tornado Alley . [ 4 ]  This area extends into Canada, particularly  Ontario  and the  Prairie Provinces . Strong tornadoes also occasionally occur in northern Mexico.   The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km), per year), [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  but most are small and cause minor damage. In absolute number of events, ignoring area, the UK experiences more tornadoes than any other European country, excluding waterspouts. [ 49 ]   Tornadoes kill about 179 people per year in Bangladesh, by far the most in the world. This is due to high population density, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge, and other factors. [ 52 ] [ 53 ]  Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, parts of  Argentina ,  Paraguay , and southern  Brazil , as well as portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia. [ 5 ] [ 54 ]   Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter. [ 15 ]  Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be caused by  landfalling   tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. But favorable conditions can occur at any time of the year.   Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of  solar heating . [ 55 ]  Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ]  However, destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The  Gainesville Tornado  of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time. [ 15 ]     Associations with climate and climate change   Associations to various  climate  and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the  sea surface temperature  of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and  Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season. [ 61 ]   Although insufficient support exists to make conclusions, some evidence does suggest that the  Southern Oscillation  is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity; which vary by season and region as well as whether the  ENSO  phase is that of  El Nio  or  La Nia . [ 62 ]   Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via  teleconnections  in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable that  global warming  may affect trends in tornado activity [ 63 ] , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region. [ 64 ]     Prediction           Probabilistic  maps issued by the  Storm Prediction Center  during the heart of the  April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak . The top map indicates the risk of general  severe weather  (including large  hail , damaging winds, and tornadoes), while the bottom map specifically shows the percent risk of a tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of any point within the enclosed area. The hashed area on the bottom map indicates a 10% or greater risk of an  F2  or stronger tornado forming within 25 miles (40 km) of a point.       Weather forecasting  is handled regionally by many national and international agencies. For the most part, they are also in charge of the prediction of conditions conducive to tornado development.     Australia   Severe thunderstorm warnings are provided to Australia by the  Bureau of Meteorology . The country is in the middle of an upgrade to  Doppler   radar  systems, with their first benchmark of installing six new radars reached in July 2006. [ 65 ]     Europe   The ESTOFEX ( European Storm Forecast Experiment ) project issues one day forecasts for severe weather likelihood and the ESSL ( European Severe Storms Laboratory ) maintain a database of events. [ 66 ] [ 67 ]     United Kingdom   In the United Kingdom, the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)  makes experimental predictions. The  Met Office  provides official forecasts for the UK.     United States   In the United States, generalized severe weather predictions are issued by the  Storm Prediction Center , based in  Norman, Oklahoma . For the next one, two, and three days, respectively, they will issue categorical and probabilistic forecasts of severe weather, including tornadoes. There is also a more general forecast issued for the four to eight day period. Just prior to the expected onset of an organized severe weather threat, SPC issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches, in collaboration with local  National Weather Service  offices.  Warnings  are issued by local National Weather Service offices when a severe thunderstorm or tornado is occurring or imminent.     Other areas   In Japan, predictions and study of tornadoes in Japan are handled by the  Japan Meteorological Agency . In Canada, weather forecasts and warnings, including tornadoes, are produced by the seven regional offices of the  Meteorological Service of Canada , a division of  Environment Canada .     Detection       Main article:  Convective storm detection              A  Doppler   radar  image indicating the likely presence of a  tornado  over  DeLand, Florida . Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image. Strong  mesocyclones  show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado. When these bright colors are one against the other on a radar display when in association with rotation, it is called a  Tornado vortex signature .       Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.   However, with the advent of  weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public  tornado warnings  were issued in 1950 and the first  tornado watches  and  convective outlooks  in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that  hook echoes  are associated with tornadoes [ 68 ] . By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away. [ 69 ]     Storm spotting   In the mid 1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train  storm spotters  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and  flash flooding . The program was called  Skywarn , and the spotters were local  sheriff's deputies ,  state troopers ,  firefighters ,  ambulance drivers ,  amateur radio operators ,  civil defense  (now  emergency management ) spotters,  storm chasers , and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.   Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as  sirens  and the  Emergency Alert System , and forward the report to the NWS. [ 70 ]  There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. [ 71 ]   In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called  Canwarn , helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. [ 72 ]  In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe [ 73 ]  and the  Tornado and Storm Research Organisation  (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.   Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  NEXRAD  do not detect a tornado; only indications of one. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but  ground truth  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out. Therefore, when far from a radar, only high in the storm is observed and the important areas are not sampled, and data resolution also suffers. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.     Visual evidence          A rotating  wall cloud  with  rear flank downdraft  clear slot evident to its left rear. Taken on  June 2 ,  1984  in Oklahoma.       Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a  supercell . They typically look to its rear, the main region of  updraft  and  inflow . Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of  tornadogenesis  is the formation of a rotating  wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. [ 47 ]   Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and  cloud tower  features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large  overshooting top , a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level  winds ), and a corkscrew look or  striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a ""beaver tail"", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and  rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow. [ 10 ]   Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a  mesocyclone . Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a  rear flank downdraft  occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of  cloud  adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a  funnel cloud  dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the  cloud base  and surface. [ 74 ]     Radar   Today, most developed countries have a network of  weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries,  Doppler   radar  stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial  direction  (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away.   Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES), which aid in the  nowcasting  of tornadic storms. [ 72 ]       Extremes       Main article:  Tornado records       The most extreme tornado in recorded history was the  Tri-State Tornado , which roared through parts of  Missouri ,  Illinois , and  Indiana  on March 18, 1925. It was likely an  F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). [ 15 ]  It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. [ 75 ]   The deadliest tornado in world history was the  Daultipur-Salturia Tornado  in  Bangladesh  on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. [ 52 ]          A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak.       The most extensive  tornado outbreak  on record, in almost every category, was the  Super Outbreak , which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern  Ontario  in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; six were of  F5  intensity, and twenty-four  F4 . This outbreak had a staggering  sixteen  tornadoes on the ground at the same time at the peak of the outbreak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. [ 76 ]   While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional  anemometers  would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by  mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301  20 mph (484  32 km/h) in the  F5   Moore, Oklahoma  tornado. Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes. [ 1 ]   Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected  Great Bend, Kansas  in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a ""rain of debris"" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of  Palmyra, Nebraska , 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast. [ 77 ]       Safety   Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the  Storm Prediction Center  advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. [ 78 ]  In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have  storm cellars  on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives. [ 79 ]   Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as  tornado watches  and  warnings  in the United States and Canada).  Weather radios  provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.   Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section). [ 80 ]     Myths and misconceptions           Salt Lake City Tornado , August 11, 1999. This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like  Utah .           Main article:  Tornado myths       One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in  atmospheric pressure  inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. [ 81 ] [ 82 ]   Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of  wind tunnel , increasing the wind's speed, making matters worse. [ 83 ]  By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes. [ 80 ]   An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more. [ 81 ] [ 82 ]   Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by  supernatural  forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, [ 84 ]  and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is ""safe"" from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others. [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 22 ]  (See  Tornado climatology ).       Continuing research          A  Doppler On Wheels  unit observing a tornado near  Attica, Kansas .       Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes even more so. Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. [ 85 ]  Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and  mesocyclones , and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from  supercell  (or other respective formative processes) to  tornadogenesis  and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.   Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level  vorticity  which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone. In particular, the role of  downdrafts , particularly the  rear-flank downdraft , and the role of  baroclinic  boundaries, are intense areas of study.   Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  mesovortices  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones. [ 86 ]   Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial)  in-situ  and  remote sensing  (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.  Numerical modeling  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  computer simulations  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.   Research programs, including field projects such as  VORTEX , deployment of  TOTO  (the TOtable Tornado Observatory),  Doppler On Wheels  (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. [ 40 ]  Universities, government agencies such as the  National Severe Storms Laboratory , private-sector meteorologists, and the  National Center for Atmospheric Research  are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the  National Science Foundation .

Frequently Asked Questions                                                 Where do tornadoes most often occur in The United States?         What is a tornado?     A tornado is a violently rotating column of air which descends from a thunderstorm to the ground. No other weather phenomenon can match the fury and destructive power of tornadoes. Tornadoes can be strong enough to destroy large buildings, leaving only the bare concrete foundation. In addition, they can lift 20-ton railroad cars from their tracks and they can drive straw and blades of grass into tree and telephone poles.     How do tornadoes form?     The truth is that scientists don't fully understand how tornadoes form. Typically, tornadoes develop several thousand feet above the earth's surface inside of a severe rotating thunderstorm. This type of storm is called a supercell thunderstorm. The spinning of these supercell thunderstorms is visible via Doppler radar.     What is a supercell thunderstorm?     A supercell is an organized thunderstorm that contains a very strong, rotating updraft. This rotation helps to produce severe weather events such as large hail, strong downbursts, and tornadoes. Supercell storms are usually isolated from other thunderstorms because it allows them to have more energy and moisture from miles around. These storms are rare, but always a threat to life and property.     What is the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado?     A tornado begins as a rotating, funnel-shaped cloud extending from a thunderstorm cloud base. A funnel cloud is made visible by cloud droplets, however, in some cases it can appear to be invisible due to lack of moisture. When the funnel cloud is half-way between the cloud base and the ground, it is called a tornado. The tornado's high-speed winds rotate about a small, relatively calm center, and suck up dust and debris, making the tornado darker and more easily seen.     What is the path length of tornadoes? How long do they last? How fast do they move?     Tornado paths range from 100 yards to one mile wide and are rarely more than 15 miles long. They can last from several seconds to more than an hour, however, most don't exceed 10 minutes. Most tornadoes travel from the southwest to northeast with an average speed of 30 mph, but the speed has been observed to range from almost no motion to 70 mph.     When and where do tornadoes occur?     Most tornadoes occur in the deep south and in the broad, relatively flat basin between the Rockies and the Appalachians, but no state is immune. Peak months of tornado activity in the U.S. are April, May, and June. However, tornadoes have occurred in every month and at all times of the day or night. A typical time of occurrence is on an unseasonably warm and sultry Spring afternoon between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m.     What causes tornadoes?     Tornadoes form under a certain set of weather conditions in which three very different types of air come together in a certain way. Near the ground lies a layer of warm and humid air, along with strong south winds. Colder air and strong west or southwest winds lie in the upper atmosphere. Temperature and moisture differences between the surface and the upper levels create what we call  instability . A necessary ingredient for tornado formation. The change in wind speed and direction with height is known as wind shear. This wind shear is linked to the eventual development of rotation from which a tornado may form.     A third layer of hot dry air becomes established between the warm moist air at low levels and the cool dry air aloft. This hot layer acts as a cap and allows the warm air underneath to warm further...making the air even more unstable. Things start to happen when a storm system aloft moves east and begins to lift the various layers. Through this lifting process the cap is removed, thereby setting the stage for explosive thunderstorm development as strong updrafts develop. Complex interactions between the updraft and the surrounding winds may cause the updraft to begin rotating-and a tornado is born.     The Great Plains of the Central United States are uniquely suited to bring all of these ingredients together, and so have become known as ""Tornado Alley."" The main factors are the Rocky Mountains to the west, the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and a terrain that slopes downward from west to east.     During the spring and summer months southerly winds prevail across the plains. At the origin of those south winds lie the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which provide plenty of  warm ,  humid air  needed to fuel severe thunderstorm development. Hot dry air forms over the higher elevations to the west, and becomes the cap as it spreads eastward over the moist Gulf air. Where the dry air and the Gulf air meet near the ground, a boundary known as a dry line forms to the west of Oklahoma. A storm system moving out of the southern Rockies may push the dry line eastward, with severe thunderstorms and tornadoes forming along the dry line or in the moist air just ahead of it.     What is the Fujita Tornado Damage Scale?     Dr. T. Theodore Fujita, a pioneer in the study of tornadoes and severe thunderstorm phenomena, developed the Fujita Tornado Damage Scale (F-Scale) to provide estimates of tornado strength based on damage surveys. Since it is extremely difficult to make direct measurements of tornado winds, an estimate of the winds based on damage is the best way to classify them. The new Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF-Scale) addresses some of the limitations identified by meteorologists and engineers since the introduction of the Fujita Scale in 1971. Variability in the quality of construction and different local building codes made classifying tornadoes in a uniform manner difficult. In many cases, these inconsistencies led to overestimates in the strength of tornadoes. The new scale identifies 28 different free standing structures most affected by tornadoes taking into account construction quality and maintenance. The range of tornado intensities remains as before, zero to five, with 'EF0' being the weakest, associated with very little damage and 'EF5' representing complete destruction, which was the case in Greensburg, Kansas on May 4th, 2007, the first tornado classified as 'EF5'. The EF scale was adopted on February 1, 2007.      The Storm Prediction Center  has a brief description of the new Enhanced Fujita Scale.  Here's  the full report submitted by the Wind Science and Engineering Center at Texas Tech University in PDF format.     A modification of the original Fujita Scale developed by ""Dr. Tornado"", T. Theodore Fujita of the University of Chicago.                 New EF Scale:     Old F-Scale:     Typical Damage:                     EF0 (65-85 mph)     F0 (65-73 mph)     Light damage . Peels surface off some roofs; some damage to gutters or siding; branches broken off trees; shallow-rooted trees pushed over.             EF1 (86-110 mph)     F1 (73-112 mph)     Moderate damage . Roofs severely stripped; mobile homes overturned or badly damaged; loss of exterior doors; windows and other glass broken.             EF2(111-135 mph)     F2 (113-157 mph)     Considerable damage . Roofs torn off well-constructed houses; foundations of frame homes shifted; mobile homes completely destroyed; large trees snapped or uprooted; light-object missiles generated; cars lifted off ground.             EF3 (136-165 mph)     F3 (158-206 mph)     Severe damage . Entire stories of well-constructed houses destroyed; severe damage to large buildings such as shopping malls; trains overturned; trees debarked; heavy cars lifted off the ground and thrown; structures with weak foundations blown away some distance.             EF4 (166-200 mph)     F4 (207-260 mph)     Devastating damage . Whole frame houses Well-constructed houses and whole frame houses completely leveled; cars thrown and small missiles generated.             EF5 (>200 mph)     F5 (261-318 mph)     Incredible damage . Strong frame houses leveled off foundations and swept away; automobile-sized missiles fly through the air in excess of 100 m (109 yd); high-rise buildings have significant structural deformation; incredible phenomena will occur.             EF No rating     F6-F12 (319 mph to speed of sound)     Inconceivable damage. Should a tornado with the maximum wind speed in excess of F5 occur, the extent and types of damage may not be conceived. A number of missiles such as iceboxes, water heaters, storage tanks, automoblies, etc.will create serious secondary damage on structures.                 What should I do to prepare myself for a tornado?     Continued vigilance and quick response to tornado watches and warnings are critical, since tornadoes can strike virtually anywhere at any time. Most tornadoes are abrupt at onset, short-lived and often obscured by rain or darkness. The best way to deal with them is preparedness. Every individual and business should have a tornado emergency plan for their homes and places of work, and should learn how to protect themselves in cars, open country, and other situations that may arise.     Remember if a tornado warning is issued for your area, a tornado is imminent. Know what to do--have an emergency plan to protect yourself and those for whom you are responsible. Quick response when a tornado approaches can save many lives. There may be only seconds in which to take action.     There are  5 Basic Steps  in the National Weather Service warning system. Every part of the system has to work for the greatest number of people to get the warning in time.             The Tornado Watch     Meteorologists using the latest in computers, radar and satellite data are always monitoring the weather elements. When a high probability of severe weather exists, a tornado or severe thunderstorm watch is issued. Watches may be issued hours before any severe storm hits the area. The forecasters at the National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Missouri use every tool available including satellite pictures, radar reports, and numerous weather charts to predict the areas where severe thunderstorms and tornadoes are likely to occur.             Spotters     Severe weather spotters are constantly being trained under the Skywarn training program. Spotting severe weatheris serious business and requires specific training. However, once an observer is trained in severe weather spotting procedures, they are one of the most reliable tools of the National Weather Service meteorologist. Spotters serve as the National Weather Service's eyes in the field.             Civil Defense and the State Police     Any information that the National Weather Service issues is relayed to individual cities and towns through state and local civil defense, and the State Police.             The Media     The vast majority of people are reached through the cooperation of the media. A direct line between the National Weather Service and local media offices insures that severe weather information is relayed quickly and broadcast within the shortest time possible.             The Users     Users include everyone within the severe thunderstorm or tornado warning area. We want to reach the greatest number of people possible and provide a concise, yet persuasive message of necessary action. Even if every other step in the warning system works, it does little good unless the users know what to do, and act.             What was the deadliest tornado outbreak in the U.S.?     The deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history occured on March 18, 1925. 747 people were killed and 2,027 were injured in Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana when several twisters touched down on this day. The largest of these tornadoes, named the ""Tri-State"", took 695 lives and was classified as an F5. It moved over 215 miles of land at 60-73 mph.     What was the longest path length of a tornado? What was the shortest?     The longest tornado path was reported to have traveled from Missouri to Indiana in 1917. It was on the ground for 7 hours and 20 minutes. Because there was no damage report filed, its difficult to know if this tornado actually stayed on the ground for the entire time, or if it was the result of several tornadoes. The shortest reported tornado was 7 feet long.     What are the strongest winds in a tornado?     Mobile Doppler radar reported one twister on May 3, 1999 as having winds as fast as 318 mph. The winds swirling around a tornado vortex have been reported to be on the range of 280-300 mph. Scientists have found that the strongest winds occur about 300 feet above the ground. Most tornadoes, however, fail to have wind speeds in excess of 113 mph.     Should I open my windows and doors during a tornado?     NO! Opening your windows and doors may in fact increase the damage to your house and make you suseptible to being struck by flying glass. Instead, use that time to find a safe spot under heavy furniture and away from windows. Any openings, including garage doors, that allow wind to enter a building increases the chance for damage.     Are the number of tornadoes increasing?     The number of tornadoes that occur each year is not increasing, but the number of spotted and reported tornadoes is. The reason for this is that more people live in or travel through tornado prone areas than used to. This has led to better communication and reportings of severe weather.     How are tornadoes detected?     In addition to the thousands of National Weather Service trained severe weather spotters, NEXRAD Doppler radars detect severe weather. These radars spot large scale rotation from which many tornadoes form. NEXRAD does not detect every tornado, but it is likely that they will provide advance warning for large twisters.                                                             Tornado Safety Rules                                                 We can do little to prevent a tornado from occurring, but by knowing the safety rules we can minimize the number of deaths and injuries.     A  tornado watch  means that tornado development is possible. Keep a watchful eye on the sky for threatening weather and stay tuned to radio and television and listen for weather bulletins.     A  tornado warning  means that a tornado has been sighted or indicated by radar. Persons in the path of the storm should seek shelter immediately - preferably in a storm cellar, underground excavation, or in a steel-framed or concrete reinforced building.     A  severe thunderstorm warning  means that either spotters or radar have indicated that severe weather is occuring, and is expected to be heading towards you soon. This warning is issued by the National Weather Service local office, and usually covers a few counties, lasting about an hour or so. A thunderstorm is classified as severe because it can contain hail three-quarter inches or larger, and/or wind gusts of 58 mph or higher, and/or a tornado. When a warning is issued, persons should remain indoors until the storm has passed.     In homes,the  basement  offers the greatest safety. Seek shelter under sturdy furniture if possible. In homes  without basements  take cover in the center part of the house, on the lowest floor, in a small room such as a closet or bathroom, or under sturdy furniture.  Stay away from windows!     In schools, hospitals, and shopping centers move to  pre-designated shelter areas . Interior hallways on lowest floors are best. If the building is  not of reinforced construction , go to a nearby one that is, or take cover outside on low, protected ground.  Stay out of auditoriums, gymnasiums, and other structures with wide free-span roofs.     In open country,  move away from the tornado's path at right angles . If there is not time to escape,lie flat in the nearest ditch or ravine.     In your car,  do not try to outrun a tornado . If available take shelter in a sturdy structure. Otherwise,  get in the nearest ditch or depression until the tornado passes .     Mobile homes are particularly vulnerable to overturning during strong winds and should be evacuated when strong winds or tornadoes are forecast. Damage can be minimized by securing trailers with cables anchored in concrete footing. Trailer parks should have some community storm shelters. If there is no shelter nearby,  leave the trailer park and take cover on low-protected ground.                                           For more information about tornadoes, visit the  NOAA Storm Prediction Center .

Some tornadoes also take place in  Europe , e. g. in the  United Kingdom  or in  Germany .   Preliminary reports suggest that there were 1,305 reported tornadoes in the U.S. (of which 1,092 were confirmed), with 81 confirmed fatalities.

After few other significant events in the rest of January, a deadly period took place in the latter part of the winter. Two deadly outbreaks and several other major tornado events marred February and March, especially in the southern US.   The spring was also fairly active, with several significant tornado events in April and May, including a major outbreak in the first weekend of May producing the first ever EF5 tornado (and first F5 tornado on any scale in the 21st century). While June was not as active with fewer tornadoes, it produced another F5 tornado and  Canada 's first such tornado.   The tropics in the Western Hemisphere produced few significant tornadoes in 2007, but  Typhoon Sepat  produced a deadly tornado in  China . Otherwise, the summer and early fall were fairly quiet, with a few local exceptions. The most severe outbreak in the second half of the year took place in October, when the largest outbreak ever recorded in that month took place.   The year ended slowly with no major outbreaks in November or December and only a few isolated tornadoes, mostly related to larger winter storms.

The  Storm Prediction Center  issued a  moderate risk  of severe weather for  April 13  over portions of North Central, Northeast  Texas , Southern  Arkansas  and Northern  Louisiana . [ 28 ]  It was also issued for the central Gulf Coast for  April 14 . During the mid-afternoon hours, the moderate risk was upgraded to a  high risk  for the second time in 2007. [ 29 ]  In the  Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex , there have been a couple of unconfirmed tornadoes throughout the region. Hail as large as 3.25 inches (8.3 cm) and wind gusts up to 80 miles per hour (130 km/h) have been reported as well.  [ 30 ]  One fatality has been reported although it may have been either from the tornado in Haltom City or from straight-line winds according to  WFAA  coverage. The tornadoes were reported in  Seymour ,  Texas  and  Haltom City ,  Texas  where one (or two) deaths has occurred. Two tornadoes of one  EF0  and an  EF1  tornado were later confirmed in  Tarrant County  near  Fort Worth  while another  EF0  was confirmed in  Dallas County  and a third  EF0  in  Rockwall County . [ 31 ]  The severe weather caused cancellation of qualifying for the 2007  Samsung 500  at  Texas Motor Speedway , forcing the field to be established via owner's points. Nonetheless, the overall activity was much lower than expected and the high risk busted.   For  April 14 , the Storm Prediction Center issued a  moderate risk  of severe weather for southern Louisiana, Mississippi,  Alabama ,  Georgia  and northwestern  Florida . Several more scattered tornadoes were reported.   While most of the activity on  April 15  was straight-line winds, an isolated  EF3  tornado touched down in  Sumter County ,  South Carolina  that morning. Several mobile homes were demolished and one person was killed, with three injured. Two other tornadoes were later confirmed in South Carolina : an  EF1  in  Lee County  and an  EF0  in  Orangeburg County . Several tornadoes also affected Georgia where at least 8 tornadoes and three injuries were documented.

The system spawned ten tornadoes through northern Texas, such as  Anton ,  Lubbock  and  Haslet , which is only a few miles from where a number of tornadoes hit the Friday before,  April 13 ,  2007 . The system also created penny to ping-pong ball-sized hail and created dangerous wind speeds. Six tornadoes were confirmed, one  EF1  and the others all  EF0 .

Two have been confirmed as of April 23. A tornado near  Moorefield ,  Nebraska  has been rated  EF3 . It destroyed six farmsteads and had a path length of 11 miles (18 km).  [ 35 ] [ 36 ]  Another  EF2  tornado was confirmed in  Dawson County ,  Nebraska , which was over 1 mile (1.6 km) wide at its peak but fortunately remained in sparsely populated areas. [ 37 ]   On  April 20 , the SPC issued a moderate risk of severe thunderstorms for the  Texas  and  Oklahoma   Panhandles  and the southwestern part of  Kansas  for April 21 which was extended into  Nebraska  later. Widespread severe weather developed that evening, although the primary result of the supercells was large hail. The meteorological synopsis was virtually identical to March 28 except for the fact that the air mass was not as unstable. [ 38 ]  In total, 19 tornadoes were reported. [ 39 ]  The hardest hit community was  Tulia ,  Texas  where many houses were reported to have been destroyed. That tornado was rated as a high-end  EF2 . Another strong tornado (also a high-end  EF2 ) hit  Cactus ,  Texas  where significant structural damage was reported (including total destruction to at least 10 mobile homes) and 14 people were injured, but remarkably, no one was killed. The tornado was 0.75 miles (1.21 km) wide at its widest point.

Such is an extremely rare issuance; only twice has such a risk been issued so far outthe others being for  June 10 ,  2005 [ 41 ]  and  January 2 ,  2006 [ 42 ]  (neither time did it result in a major outbreak).  [ 43 ]   Several tornadic storms were reported across northwest and south-central Texas, far western Oklahoma, and southwest Kansas on April 23. At least 29 tornadoes have been reported. Some were reported to have been large and powerful in the sparsely populated area. However, no injuries were reported. [ 44 ]   The activity quickly redeveloped late in the morning of April 24. Later in the afternoon, the risk that day was upgraded to a  high risk  over parts of  East Texas . Tornadoes, along with large hail and damaging winds, occurred in the afternoon and evening hours across the Plains. 22 tornadoes were reported. [ 45 ]  One large tornadic supercell also moved through  Piedras Negras ,  Coahuila  in  Mexico , and moved into  Eagle Pass ,  Texas , with reports of significant damage on the U.S. side of the border and at least seven deaths and 74 injuries from that  EF3  tornado, plus at least three deaths and at least 40 injuries across the river in Piedras Negras.

Tornado watches were spread throughout Texas. However, the supercells redeveloped into a hybrid  derecho  across  Central  and  North Texas  that evening, stretching from the  Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex  to south of  Waco  and extending eastward to about  Longview . Widespread wind damage with winds in excess of 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) were reported. [ 50 ]  In the Metroplex, more than 300,000 customers lost power as a result of the high winds. Some of the most severe damage included the loss of a roof at an apartment complex, extensive tree and power line damage (with many trees crashing into houses) and flipped tractor-trailers and mobile homes. [ 51 ]  However, no fatalities were reported.   A significant severe weather event developed across the central  Plains  on the evening of  May 4 . Early in the morning, The Storm Prediction Center issued a  moderate risk  of severe thunderstorms for  May 4  over portions of Central  Nebraska , Western  Kansas , Western  Oklahoma , Eastern  Colorado  and portions of the  Texas   Panhandle . [ 52 ]  Around 6:35 pm CDT (2335 UTC), a tornado was reported by  KWTV  storm spotters on the ground near  Arnett ,  Oklahoma . The tornado stayed in mostly sparsely-populated rural areas, but there were reports of a house 7 miles (11 km) west of Arnett being hit. At around 9:50 pm CDT (0250 UTC), there was a violent and destructive tornado in southwest  Kansas  near  Greensburg . The tornado also moved into other communities including  Trousdale ,  Macksville ,  Ellinwood ,  Claflin  and  Holyrood  which have taken direct hits from significant tornadoes. [ 53 ]  City administrator Steve Hewitt has said that 90% of Greensburg was destroyed and at least 16 people were critically injured, according to  Fox . [ 54 ]  Much of Macksville was also damaged or destroyed. 12 people died and 63 were injured according to the  National Weather Service  and  CNN . The tornado was rated an  EF5  on the Enhanced Fujita Scale  [ 55 ] , the first since the new scale was implemented and the first category 5 tornado since the  Bridge Creek  tornado during the  1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  on  May 3 ,  1999 .

A low pressure system moved across much of central and eastern North America starting on  June 6  in the central Plains and into the  Mississippi Valley ,  Great Lakes  region and eventually the  Northeast  over the following few days. On  June 4 , the Storm Prediction Center issued a  moderate risk  of severe weather for  June 6 , only the fourth such issuance for a day three outlook. On the morning of  June 5 , the Storm Prediction Center continued the  moderate risk  for  June 6  and issued a  moderate risk  for  June 7  over much of the  Upper Midwest , making it the fifth time a  moderate risk  has been issued on day 3. Both were forwarded to days 1 and 2, respectively, on  June 6 . [ 28 ] [ 43 ]   On  June 6 , there were two distinct threats forecast. The central Plains were expected to see a large tornado outbreak potentially, particularly in  Nebraska  and the  Dakotas  close to the  dry line , should the cap have broken in the atmosphere in the afternoon hours. In the evening and overnight hours, a major  derecho  with destructive winds and some scattered tornadoes were possible farther east, particularly in the eastern Dakotas, western  Minnesota  and western  Iowa . [ 65 ]  However, that basically busted as little severe weather happened as the cap held up in most areas. Only five tornadoes and scattered wind reports took place. [ 72 ]   A  high risk  of severe storms was issued for  June 7  for the Upper Midwest, from about the  Quad Cities  north to  Lake Superior . Widespread tornadoes and destructive downburst winds were possible. [ 65 ]  A  moderate  risk was issued for portions of  Minnesota ,  Michigan  and  Illinois  while a  slight risk  was issued south towards  Oklahoma , which was then upgraded to a  moderate risk  late in the day.  Environment Canada  also issued a risk of severe thunderstorms with possible tornadoes for all of northwestern  Ontario  and a severe weather watch was issued early Thursday morning from the  Manitoba  border towards the north shore of  Lake Superior   [ 73 ] [ 63 ]   There were 14 tornado reports that day. The most serious damage was near  Mosinee ,  Wisconsin  where a house was heavily damaged by an  EF2  tornado, and in  Wisconsin Rapids ,  Wisconsin  where a weak tornado touched down in or near the downtown area, along with  softball  sized hail. [ 74 ]  However, farther south, the cap has held in place once again, restricting activity to the northern areas. [ 75 ]   The largest confirmed tornado on  June 7  was an  EF3  that touched down in central Wisconsin. It was on the ground for 40 miles (64 km) while passing through  Shawano ,  Menominee ,  Langlade , and  Oconto counties . It was up to 3/4 miles (1.2070080000000 km) wide at times and took down 14,000 acres (57 km) of forest, damaging dozens of buildings. [ 74 ]   On  June 8 ,  Environment Canada  issued a  moderate risk  of severe thunderstorms for  Eastern Ontario  with the risk of tornadoes. A  Slight risk  was issued for most of  Southern  and  Northeastern Ontario . The  slight risk  zone extends from southern Quebec, near  Montreal  into northern  Mexico   [ 65 ]   [ 63 ]  During the noon hours, the  moderate risk  zone was extended further south to includes portions of western  New York , western  Pennsylvania , northern  West Virginia , northern  Kentucky , southeastern  Indiana , most of  Ohio  and larger portions of southern  Ontario  from  Windsor  to eastern  Ontario . It turned out to be a long squall line though, and while there was wind damage from winds as strong as 85 miles per hour (137 km/h) stretching from the  Tennessee Valley  north to almost  Hudson Bay , there were only two tornadoes, one near  Brantford  southwest of  Toronto  and the other near  Bancroft  north of  Peterborough ,  Ontario .

Six of the tornadoes were ranked as  EF1 .   A supercell that developed over the  Nebraska / Kansas  border produced extensive hail and at least 7 reported tornadoes on  June 19 . The storm that travelled southeast through Oklahoma and North Texas eventually became an  Mesoscale Convective Complex  dumping heavy rain across areas that had been hit with significant flooding.   A sharp cold front also produced widespread wind damage across the  Great Lakes  and the Northeast and at least one reported tornado.

Several reports of large hail exceeding golf ball size was reported. [ 65 ] [ 80 ]  The strongest tornado took place in  Norwalk ,  Iowa , it was an  EF2  which heavily damaged homes. [ 81 ]          F5 tornado near the town of Elie, Manitoba on  June 22 ,  2007 .       On  June 22 , more severe storms developed, this time primarily farther north. The most intense weather was across southern  Manitoba  where tornadoes were reported. The most severe damage was around  Elie ,  Manitoba  where several houses were flattened and numerous others damaged or destroyed. A  flour  mill was also destroyed and several trucks were overturned on  Highway 1 . The tornado path was 3.7 miles (6.0 km) long, and was initially rated as an  F4  on the  Fujita Scale , but was then rated as an  F5  becoming the first tornado of its kind in Canada. [ 82 ]  Another tornado hit  McHenry County ,  North Dakota ; it was an  EF1  with moderate damage, mainly to trees and farm buildings. [ 83 ]   More tornadoes were possible across southeastern  Saskatchewan , southern Manitoba and extreme northern  North Dakota  on  June 23 . The cap broke across the northern parts of the area and supercells formed that afternoon, primarily in Manitoba. At least five tornadoes were reported, including large wedge tornadoes. Fortunately, they missed populated areas for the most part. One of the tornadoes traveled 9 miles (14 km) south of  Baldur ,  Manitoba  and was rated an  F3  on the Fujita scale.  [ 84 ]   [ 85 ] . The tornadoes were described as being ""as bad as they ever get here in Canada"" (referring to the F4 tornado) as meteorologist  Dave Carlsen  of  Environment Canada  told  Canwest Global  affiliate  CKND-TV . [ 86 ]  However, the tornado in  Elie  was recently upgraded to F5, after Environment Canada determined that wind speeds were at least 420 km/h in video analyses of that tornado.

The hardest-hit areawas the  Bay Ridge  area of  Brooklyn , where many treesas much as 40% of the trees in  Sunset Park  were knocked down and several homes and buildings lost part of their roofs. A second tornado was also confirmed just east of the track of the first tornado and rated as a strong  EF1  where additional roofs of homes were damaged. The  Flatbush  neighborhood, as well as areas on  Staten Island , were also affected. [ 96 ] [ 97 ]   Accompanying the tornadoes was a storm which dumped several inches of rain on the city in a few hours, resulting in flooding which effectively shut down the mass transit system. Several people were injured by the tornado, and one person died from the associated flooding. The tornado was the first to hit  Brooklyn  since 1950 when modern record-keeping began. [ 98 ]     [ edit ]   August 9   At the northern boundary of a  heat wave , severe thunderstorms developed on the afternoon of  August 9  in  Ohio  and western  Pennsylvania . Several sudden supercells developed with at least four tornadoes reported, primarily around  Akron ,  Ohio . Significant damage was reported, including roofs removed from a  high school  and a  factory , as well as numerous houses. Widespread straight-line wind damage was also reported. One person was killed by a fallen tree limb in  Marion ,  Ohio , although it is unclear if it is due to a tornado or straight-line winds. [ 99 ]   In Pittsburgh, a funnel cloud was spotted downtown near the Carnegie Science Center, shattering windows and evacuating the 1000 patrons to the lower level. The museum was closed until  August 13 . Over 90,000 homes and businesses were without power, some not receiving it until August 12.

[ 102 ]     [ edit ]   August 2324   A tornado was spotted in  Sanilac County, Michigan  around 5:21 PM EDT on  August 23 , after a hot muggy day caused convection east of an oncoming (eastbound) cold front. Another unconfirmed tornado was spotted tracking from  Livonia, Michigan  to  Redford Township, Michigan .   It was part of a larger  derecho  with winds up to 100 mph (160 km/h) that did significant damage in the  Chicago area  and in western Michigan. Embedded in the derecho was an  EF1  tornado that touched down in  Winfield, Illinois  in  DuPage County . [ 103 ]   The National Weather Service office in  Grand Rapids, Michigan , confirmed that two  EF1  tornadoes hit rural  Montcalm County  near Cedar Lake. [ 104 ]  Non-tornadic severe thunderstorms also did serious damage in  Berrien ,  Van Buren ,  Kalamazoo , and  Allegan  counties.   On  August 24 , following conditions similar to the previous day, an  EF3  tornado with ""winds near 140 mph (230 km/h)"" formed two miles (3 km) north of  Charlotte, Michigan , doing severe damage along Vermontville Highway, passing through  Potterville , and crossing  I-69  in  Eaton County  before dissipating as it approached  Dimondale , touching down around 4:25 PM EDT and leaving a damage path varying from 200 yards (200 m) to 300 yards (300 m) wide and 6.5 miles (10.5 km) long. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]   Around 4:55 pm EDT, the same storm produced an  EF1  tornado which touched down at the intersection of Waverly Road and  M-99  in southeastern  Lansing , extending across I-96, towards the intersections of Aurelius Road with Jolly Road and Dunkel Road before finally dissipating near the Jolly Road interchange on  I-496 . [ 105 ] [ 106 ]   Other storms in the same system later produced tornadoes in the NWS Detroit/Pontiac office coverage area. The most powerful one was a ""strong  EF2 "" that touched down in  Cohoctah Township ,  Livingston County, Michigan  at around 5:30 PM EDT. Remaining on the ground for 26 miles (42 km), with an average track width of 200 yards (200 m) and a maximum track width of one-quarter mile in the city of  Fenton ,  Genesee County , the funnel continued through  Deerfield Township  and northwestern  Tyrone Township  before entering  Genesee County  and the city of  Fenton , where it caused the partial collapse of ""a large retail structure"" at the intersection of Owen Road and  US-23 . It then passed on into  Holly , in  Oakland County  before dissipating into straight-line winds east of Holly. [ 107 ] [ 106 ]   Three other tornadoes were confirmed by damage surveys. An  EF0  tornado touched down briefly (track length 50 yards) near the intersection of Durand Road and  M-21  in eastern  Shiawassee County, Michigan  at around 5:23 PM EDT, while another  EF0  tornado touched down for three miles (5 km) in  Salem Township ,  Washtenaw County  at around 6:02 PM EDT. Additionally, an  EF1  tornado struck in  Hadley Township ,  Lapeer County , at around 6:16 PM EDT, leaving a four mile (6 km) long damage path. [ 107 ] [ 106 ]  Numerous reports of straight-line wind damage were also received throughout the entire NWS Detroit/Pontiac coverage area.   The storms in this system were part of the same system that sat over the Midwest Areas for almost a week, bringing pouring rain at first then the Severe Weather later in the week. This storm system and stationary front is also blamed for the flooding in the Ohio area.     [ edit ]   August 23 (Colombia)   A rare tornado occurred in the capital of  Colombia ,  Bogot , and was caught on tape. There were no immediate word on any damage or injuries. [ 108 ]  Much of western Colombia lies along the  Andes  mountain chain which limits tornado activity in that region. However, in June 2001 a tornado killed six people and injured 350 in the town of  Barranquillia  in extreme northern Colombia. [ 109 ]     [ edit ]   August 26          Clearing the wreckage in  Northwood ,  North Dakota .

[ 110 ]  One of the tornadoes was very destructive and did widespread damage in  Northwood, North Dakota . One fatality occurred in Northwood and multiple structures were damaged or destroyed including a  mobile home  park and the community's  hospital , school, and  fire hall . This was the first killer U.S. tornado since  May 5 ,  2007 . [ 111 ] [ 112 ]  18 other people were injured by the tornado, which was about 0.8 mile (1.3 km) wide. Surveys confirmed it to be an  EF4  tornado; the fifth violent US tornado of 2007. [ 113 ]     [ edit ]   September   63 tornadoes were reported in the US in September, of which at least 51 were confirmed.     [ edit ]   September 1314       Main article:  Hurricane Humberto (2007)       The remnants of  Hurricane Humberto  which made landfill west of the  Texas / Louisiana  border on  September 13  produced several clusters of thunderstorms, which spawned at least eight confirmed tornadoes (and several more unconfirmed reports) across portions of  North Carolina , along with widespread straight-line wind damage. In  Clemmons  one tornado damaged several homes, while another tornado significantly damaged a nursing home in  Fuquay-Varina  forcing the evacuation due to a fire in an electrical boxes. Counties affected included  Wake ,  Johnston  and  Harnett . There were no injuries from any of the tornadoes. Seven of the tornadoes were  EF0 , and the other was  EF1 . [ 114 ] [ 115 ]     [ edit ]   September 2021   An undeveloped tropical low over the  Gulf of Mexico  (which later became  Tropical Depression Ten ) spawned one confirmed and several possible tornadoes late on September 20 and early on September 21 over parts of central  Florida , not far from areas devastated on February 2. The hardest-hit community was  Eustis, Florida  where at least 50 houses were damaged, many of which were destroyed.  Looting  was reported in the community after the tornado hit. No serious injuries were reported by the  EF1  tornado. [ 116 ]     [ edit ]   September 30   Severe thunderstorms developed across the Midwest on  September 30 . Several tornadoes touched down, the strongest being an  EF2  tornado near  Sully, Iowa , which was 22 miles (35 km) long and up to 0.7 mile (1.1 km) wide at its peak. Heavy damage was reported to several houses and industrial buildings from the largest of the tornadoes. [ 117 ]  Several injuries were reported in  Pike County, Illinois  due to  mobile home  damage from an  EF0  tornado there. [ 118 ]     [ edit ]   October   115 tornadoes were reported in the US in October, of which 87 have been confirmed.     [ edit ]   October 2   A sharp cold front with low-topped supercells triggered a small outbreak of tornadoes across a portion of the central United States, particularly in the central  Mississippi Valley . At least 15 tornadoes were reported, resulting in at least two injuries and scattered reports of damage, including structural damage to buildings. [ 119 ]  The strongest tornado was near Woodland, Missouri; it was an  EF2  that destroyed a mobile home (critically injuring one elderly occupant) and damaged numerous other buildings. [ 118 ]   One of the more notable tornadoes hit the  downtown  core of  Des Moines, Iowa . It was an  EF1  that produced only minor damage along most of its path, with the most serious damage being flipped vehicles along Mulberry Street. [ 120 ]     [ edit ]   October 10   A tornado damaged 10 houses in  Barek Tila , a village in the  Sunamganj District  of northern  Bangladesh , injuring 25 people. Another tornado also struck north-central  Jamalpur District , damaging 500 homes and 200 hectares (2.0 km 2 ) of  sugarcane . [ 121 ]     [ edit ]   October 15   Three tornadoes hit the  Barisal District ,  Gopalganj  and  Bhola District  districts of southern Bangladesh, killing seven people and leaving 3,000 people homeless.

A complex storm system, involving a deepening  low pressure area  (979 mb  [ 122 ] ), a tropical low and a series of fronts, developed across the  central United States . The SPC forecast a potential severe weather event, possibly a major outbreak, beginning October 17 across much of central and eastern  North America .   A  moderate risk  of severe storms was issued for October 17 across parts of the central U.S. Some activity developed early in the morning of October 17, although no tornadoes were reported. The main supercell activity began that afternoon across a wide swath from  Missouri  south to  Louisiana  and west to  Oklahoma . At least 16 tornadoes were reported and seven confirmed, with damage in  Franklinton, Louisiana  and  Mount Vernon, Missouri  (an  EF2 ). In addition,  KTUL  has reported at least 40 people were injured in  Tulsa  at  Oktoberfest  when thunderstorm winds ripped through the area. [ 123 ]  The activity turned deadly overnight as an isolated tornado developed in the overnight hours near  Paris, Missouri . At least two people were killed when a tornado hit a mobile home. [ 124 ]   More severe weather is expected on  October 18  across the  Ohio Valley  and the  Great Lakes  region. Another  moderate risk  has been issued with tornadoes the main threat. Tornadoes are also possible across the  Southern US , particularly the  Gulf Coast . The activity began quickly in the southern threat area, and an  EF1  tornado took place in the downtown area of  Pensacola, Florida . Damage was reported to many buildings in the downtown core, as well as a section of  Cordova Mall .  Electricity  was cut in the area. No injuries were reported. [ 125 ]  In total, at least 30 tornadoes have been reported so far on October 18 and at least 18 have been confirmed. The hardest-hit state has been  Kentucky , where many tornadic supercells formed between  Paducah  and  Louisville , and  WFIE  has reported many injuries and possible fatalities in numerous communities. At least one person was confirmed dead in  Owensboro, Kentucky . However, the  National Weather Service [ 126 ]  has only confirmed minor injuries. Another major tornado has been reported near  Nappanee, Indiana ; a tornado emergency was declared there. One person was confirmed dead in  Kalkaska, Michigan , following an  EF2  tornado there while two other people were killed in  Ingham County  in the  Lansing  viewing area by an  EF2  that caused extensive damage in the  Williamston  area. While early indications had severe weather continuing into October 19, the lack of sunshine prevented initiation even though temperatures in the 80s  Fahrenheit  were common as far north as southeastern Ontario and southwestern Quebec.     [ edit ]   October 26   A spectacular multi-vortex tornado developed near the town of Dunoon, near the  City of Lismore ,  New South Wales ,  Australia . The tornado developed from a supercell at approximately 4pm damaging a power sub-station then going on to Dunoon where it ripped the wall of a church and damaged the roofs and walls of about 20 houses. The tornado was captured on film by both a local [ 127 ]  and Australian stormchaser Jimmy Deguara and estimated to be at least an  EF1  in strength. [ 128 ]  and  [ 129 ]     [ edit ]   November   Seven tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in November, of which six were confirmed.     [ edit ]   November 6   While tornado occurrences are very rare, the  Colombian  capital  Bogot  was hit by its second tornado of the year. The cyclone which was also caught on tape, tore up the roof of a car dealership and additional scattered damage. No injuries or deaths were reported during the tornado event. The area was hit with extensive severe weather over the past few days which included torrential rains that caused significant flooding across the region as well as hail and wind. Hundreds of motorists were stranding on area roads due to the extensive amounts of hail and rain. [ 130 ] [ 131 ]     [ edit ]   November 14          Tornado damage in  Laurel County ,  Kentucky  on  November 14 ,  2007 .       After a lull in activity in the US, several tornadoes touched down across parts of the  Tennessee Valley  north into  Kentucky  on  November 14 . The strongest was an  EF2  in  Kimball, Tennessee  where several houses and a church were heavily damaged, injuring nine people. [ 132 ]  Structural damage was also reported in  Laurel County, Kentucky [ 133 ]  and in two counties in  Middle Tennessee [ 134 ]  from separate  EF1  tornadoes.     [ edit ]   December   22 tornadoes were reported in the US in December, of which at least 15 were confirmed.

A complex weather system developed in mid-December, involving the merging of the remnants of  Tropical Storm Olga  with a  cold front  associated with a major winter storm to the north over the  Northeast  and  Midwest . As a result, the first severe weather episode in over a month in the US produced several tornadoes across the  Deep South , particularly southern  Georgia  and northern and central  Florida , late on  December 15  and early on  December 16 . At least 12 tornadoes were reported across the region, with significant damage in several communities. In addition, straight line wind damage has also been reported across the region. One of the more notable tornadoes, an  EF1 , hit the  Pasco County   Jail , causing significant damage to the facility. No one was injured there. [ 135 ]  The strongest tornado was an  EF2  near  Lothair, Georgia . [ 136 ]   One person was killed near  Ashburn, Georgia , when his  eighteen-wheeler  was thrown off  Interstate 75  by an  EF1  tornado. [ 137 ]     [ edit ]   December 20   Severe thunderstorms developed in the  Southeast  late in the evening on  December 19 , with wind and hail damage reported in eastern  Texas ,  Louisiana ,  Mississippi , and  Alabama . [ 138 ] [ 139 ]  On December 20 a tornado formed near  Brookhaven, Mississippi , damaging several buildings and destroying two mobile homes. One person was injured. The tornado was rated  EF2 .

These                   natural events can cause massive damage and                   destruction. The study of earthquakes is called                   seismology.                                                                                 Harder  - An                   earthquake is caused by sudden, violent shifting of                   massive rocks called plates under the earth's                   surface. This movement of the plates releases                   stress that accumulates along geologic faults. A                   fault is a deep crack that marks the boundary                   between two of these plates. Earthquake belts occur                   along faults around the world. Many run along                   coastal areas. The San Andreas fault in central                   California is well-known for causing severe                   earthquakes.                                                                                 The epicenter is the point on the surface where                   the earthquake is the strongest. The Richter scale                   is used to measure the amount of energy released by                   the earthquake. The severity of an earthquake runs                   from 0 to 9 on this scale. Small tremors occur                   constantly, but every few months a major earthquake                   occurs somewhere in the world. Scientists are                   researching ways to predict earthquakes, but their                   predictions are not always accurate.                                                                                                                                                                  National                   Earthquake Information Center  (Dept. of the                   Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, Golden, Colorado)                                                              http://neic.usgs.gov/                                              NEIS has three main missions: to determine                      as rapidly and as accurately as possible the                      location and size of all destructive earthquakes                      that occur worldwide, collect and provide to                      scientists and the public an extensive seismic                      database that serves as a solid foundation for                      scientific research, and pursue an active                      research program to improve the ability to                      locate and understand earthquakes.

Nature's Most Violent Storms           A PREPAREDNESS GUIDE Including Safety Information for Schools U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service September 1992 (NOAA, FEMA, The American Red Cross )    For full color graphic version  click here  (you need an adobe acrobat reader to view this -  download  a free copy now.)    Tornado!   Although tornadoes occur in many parts of the world, these destructive forces of nature are found most frequently in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains during the spring and summer months. In an average year, 800 tornadoes are reported nationwide, resulting in 80 deaths and over 1,500 injuries. A tornado is defined as a violently rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. The most violent tornadoes are capable of tremendous destruction with wind speeds of 250 mph or more. Damage paths can be in excess of one mile wide and 50 miles long. Once a tornado in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, carried a motel sign 30 miles and dropped it in Arkansas!    What causes tornadoes?   Thunderstorms develop in warm, moist air in advance of eastward-moving cold fronts. These thunderstorms often produce large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. Tornadoes in the winter and early spring are often associated with strong, frontal systems that form in the Central States and move east. Occasionally, large outbreaks of tornadoes occur with this type of weather pattern. Several states may be affected by numerous severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.   During the spring in the Central Plains, thunderstorms frequently develop along a ""dryline,"" which separates very warm, moist air to the east from hot, dry air to the west. Tornado-producing thunderstorms may form as the dryline moves east during the afternoon hours.   Along the front range of the Rocky Mountains, in the Texas panhandle, and in the southern High Plains, thunderstorms frequently form as air near the ground flows ""upslope"" toward higher terrain. If other favorable conditions exist, these thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.   Tornadoes occasionally accompany tropical storms and hurricanes that move over land. Tornadoes are most common to the right and ahead of the path of the storm center as it comes onshore.     Tornado Variations       Some tornadoes may form during the early stages of rapidly developing thunderstorms. This type of tornado is most common along the front range of the Rocky Mountains, the Plains, and the Western States.       Tornadoes may appear nearly transparent until dust and debris are picked up.       Occasionally, two or more tornadoes may occur at the same time.       Waterspout       Waterspouts are weak tornadoes that form over warm water.       Waterspouts are most common along the Gulf Coast and southeastern states. In the western United States, they occur with cold late fall or late winter storms, during a time when you least expect tornado development.       Waterspouts occasionally move inland becoming tornadoes causing damage and injuries.         How Do Tornadoes Form?   Before thunderstorms develop, a change in wind direction and an increase in wind speed with increasing height creates an invisible, horizontal spinning effect in the lower atmosphere.   Rising air within the thunderstorm updraft tilts the rotating air from horizontal to vertical.   An area of rotation, 2-6 miles wide, now extends through much of the storm. Most strong and violent tornadoes form within this area of strong rotation.    A lower cloud base in the center of the photograph identifies an area of rotation known as a rotating wall cloud. This area is often nearly rain-free. Note rain in the background.   Moments later a strong tornado develops in this area. Softball-size hail and damaging ""straight-line"" winds also occurred with this storm.     Tornadoes Take Many   Shapes and Sizes    Weak Tornadoes       69% of all tornadoes       Less than 5% of tornado deaths       Lifetime 1-10+ minutes       Winds less than 110 mph      Strong Tornadoes       29% of all tornadoes       Nearly 30% of all tornado deaths       May last 20 minutes or longer       Winds 110-205 mph      Violent Tornadoes       Only 2% of all tornadoes       70% of all tornado deaths       Lifetime can exceed 1 hour       Winds greater than 205 mph      Tornado Myths:     MYTH: Areas near rivers, lakes, and mountains are safe from tornadoes.    FACT: No place is safe from tornadoes. In the late 1980's, a tornado swept through Yellowstone National Park leaving a path of destruction up and down a 10,000 ft. mountain.     MYTH: The low pressure with a tornado causes buildings to ""explode"" as the tornado passes overhead.    FACT: Violent winds and debris slamming into buildings cause most structural damage.    MYTH:Windows should be opened before a tornado approaches to equalize pressure and minimize damage.    FACT: Opening windows allows damaging winds to enter the structure. Leave the windows alone; instead, immediately go to a safe place.      Tornadoes Occur Anywhere   Carolinas Outbreak:       March 28, 1984, afternoon-evening     22 tornadoes     57 deaths     1,248 injuries     damage $200 million     37% of fatalities in mobile homes         Pennsylvania-Ohio Outbreak:       May 31, 1985, late afternoon-evening     41 tornadoes, including 27 in PA and OH     75 deaths in U.S.     1,025 injuries     damage $450 million         Plains Outbreak:        April 26-27, 1991, afternoon of 26th through early morning 27th     54 tornadoes     21 deaths     308 injuries     damage $277+ million     15 deaths in/near mobile homes, 2 deaths in vehicles         Weather Radar Watches the Sky    Meteorologists rely on weather radar to provide information on developing storms. The National Weather Service is strategically locating Doppler radars across the country which can detect air movement toward or away from the radar. Early detection of increasing rotation aloft within a thunderstorm can allow life-saving warnings to be issued before the tornado forms.     Frequency of Tornadoes       Tornadoes can occur at any time of the year.     In the southern states, peak tornado occurrence is in March through May, while peak months in the northern states are during the summer.     Note, in some states, a secondary tornado maximum occurs in the fall.     Tornadoes are most likely to occur between 3 and 9 p.m. but have been known to occur at all hours of the day or night.     The average tornado moves from southwest to northeast, but tornadoes have been known to move in any direction. The average forward speed is 30 mph but may vary from nearly stationary to 70 mph.     The total number of tornadoes is probably higher than indicated in the western states. Sparce population reduces the number reported.                   STAY INFORMED ABOUT THE STORM   by listening to NOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio, and television for the latest tornado WATCHES and WARNINGS.   When conditions are favorable for severe weather to develop, a severe thunderstorm or tornado  WATCH  is issued.   Weather Service personnel use information from weather radar, spotters, and other sources to issue severe thunderstorm and tornado WARNINGS for areas where severe weather is imminent.   Severe thunderstorm warnings are passed to local radio and television stations and are broadcast over local NOAA Weather Radio stations serving the warned areas. These warnings are also relayed to local emergency management and public safety officials who can activate local warning systems to alert communities.   NOAA WEATHER RADIO IS THE BEST MEANS TO RECEIVE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE   The National Weather Service continuously broadcasts updated weather warnings and forecasts that can be received by  NOAA  Weather Radios sold in many stores. The average range is 40 miles, depending on topography. Your National Weather Service recommends purchasing a radio that has both a battery backup and a tone-alert feature which automatically alerts you when a watch or warning is issued.   What To Listen For...      TORNADO WATCH : Tornadoes are possible in your area. Remain alert for approaching storms.       TORNADO WARNING : A tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar. If a tornado warning is issued for your area and the sky becomes threatening, move to your pre-designated place of safety.       SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH : Severe thunderstorms are possible in your area.       SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING : Severe thunderstorms are occurring.    Remember, tornadoes occasionally develop in areas in which a severe thunderstorm watch or warning is in effect. Remain alert to signs of an approaching tornado and seek shelter if threatening conditions exist.      Environmental Clues   Look out for:        Dark, often greenish sky       Wall cloud       Large hail       Loud roar; similar to a freight train      Caution:   Some tornadoes appear as a visible funnel extending only partially to the ground. Look for signs of debris below the visible funnel.   Some tornadoes are clearly visible while others are obscured by rain or nearby low-hanging clouds.    Other Thunderstorm Hazards    These dangers often accompany thunderstorms:       Flash Floods: Number ONE weather killer - 146 deaths annually       Lightning: Kills 75-100 people each year       Damaging Straight-line Winds: Can reach 140 mph       Large Hail: Can reach the size of a grapefruit - causes several hundred million dollars in damage annually to property and crops      Contact your local National Weather Service office, American Red Cross chapter, or Federal Emergency Management Agency office for a copy of the ""Thunderstorms and Lightning...The Underrated Killers"" brochure (NOAA PA 92053) and the ""Flash Floods and Floods...The Awesome Power"" brochure (NOAA PA 92050).       Tornado Safety   What  YOU  Can Do      Before the Storm:       Develop a  plan for you and your family  for home, work, ,   school  and when outdoors.       Have frequent drills.       Know the county/parish in which you live, and keep a highway map nearby to follow storm movement from weather bulletins.       Have a  NOAA Weather Radio  with a warning alarm tone and battery back-up to receive warnings.       Listen to radio and television for information.       If planning a trip outdoors, listen to the latest forecasts and take necessary action if threatening weather is possible.        If a Warning is issued or if threatening weather approaches:        In a home or building, move to a pre-designated shelter, such as a basement.       If an underground shelter is not available, move to an interior room or hallway on the lowest floor and get under a sturdy piece of furniture.       Stay away from windows.       Get out of automobiles.       Do not try to outrun a tornado in your car; instead, leave it immediately.       Mobile homes, even if tied down, offer little protection from tornadoes and should be abandoned.       Occasionally, tornadoes develop so rapidly that advance warning is not possible. Remain alert for signs of an approaching tornado. Flying debris from tornadoes causes most deaths and injuries.       It's Up To YOU!   Each year, many people are killed or seriously injured by tornadoes despite advance warning. Some did not hear the warning while others received the warning but did not believe a tornado would actually affect them. The preparedness information in this brochure, combined with timely severe weather watches and warnings, could save your life in the event a tornado threatens your area. After you have received the warning or observed threatening skies, YOU must make the decision to seek shelter before the storm arrives. It could be the most important decision you will ever make.   Who's Most At Risk?        People in automobiles     The elderly, very young, and the physically or mentally impaired     People in mobile homes     People who may not understand the warning due to a language barrier                     Tornado Safety in Schools    EVERY School Should Have A Plan!        Develop a severe weather action plan and have frequent drills,       Each school should be inspected and tornado shelter areas designated by a registered engineer or architect. Basements offer the best protection. Schools without basements should use interior rooms and hallways on the lowest floor and away from windows.       Those responsible for activating the plan should monitor weather information from NOAA Weather Radio and local radio/television.       If the school's alarm system relies on electricity, have a compressed air horn or megaphone to activate the alarm in case of power failure.       Make special provisions for disabled students and those in portable classrooms.       Make sure someone knows how to turn off electricity and gas in the event the school is damaged.       Keep children at school beyond regular hours if threatening weather is expected. Children are safer at school than in a bus or car. Students should not be sent home early if severe weather is approaching.       Lunches or assemblies in large rooms should be delayed if severe weather is anticipated. Gymnasiums, cafeterias, and auditoriums offer no protection from tornado-strength winds.       Move students quickly into interior rooms or hallways on the lowest floor. Have them assume the tornado protection position (shown at right).       Hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions should develop a similar plan     Your National Weather Service, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and American Red Cross educate community officials and the public concerning the dangers posed by tornadoes. YOU can prepare for the possibility of a tornado by learning the safest places to seek shelter when at home, work, school, or outdoors. You should also understand basic weather terms and danger signs related to tornadoes. Your chances of staying safe during a tornado are greater if you have a plan for you and your family, and practice the plan frequently.       FAMILY DISASTER PLAN    Families should be prepared for all hazards that affect their area. NOAA's National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the American Red Cross urge each family to develop a family disaster plan.    Where will your family be when disaster strikes? They could be anywhere - at work, at school, or in the car. How will you find each other? Will you know if your children are safe? Disasters may force you to evacuate your neighborhood or confine you to your home. What would you do if basic services - water, gas, electricity or telephones - were cut off?   Follow these basic steps to develop a family disaster plan...         I. Gather information about hazards.  Contact your local National Weather Service office, emergency management or civil defense office, and American Red Cross chapter. Find out what type of disasters could occur and how you should respond. Learn your community's warning signals and evacuation plans.             II. Meet with your family to create a plan.  Discuss the information you have gathered. Pick two places to meet: a spot outside your home for an emergency, such as fire, and a place away from your neighborhood in case you can't return home. Choose an out-of-state friend as your ""family check-in contact"" for everyone to call if the family gets separated. Discuss what you would do if advised to evacuate.             III. Implement your plan .           (1) Post emergency telephone numbers by phones;      (2) Install safety features in your house, such as smoke detectors and fire extinguishers;       (3) Inspect your home for potential hazards (such as items that can move, fall, break, or catch fire) and correct them;      (4) Have your family learn basic safety measures, such as CPR and first aid; how to use a fire extinguisher; and how and when to turn off water, gas, and electricity in your home;       (5) Teach children how and when to call 911 or your local Emergency Medical Services number;       (6) Keep enough supplies in your home to meet your needs for at least three days. Assemble a disaster supplies kit with items you may need in case of an evacuation. Store these supplies in sturdy, easy-to-carry containers, such as backpacks or duffle bags. Keep important family documents in a waterproof container. Keep a smaller disaster supplies kit in the trunk of your car.            A DISASTER SUPPLIES KIT SHOULD INCLUDE:               A 3-day supply of water (one gallon per person per day) and food that won't spoil            one change of clothing and footwear per person            one blanket or sleeping bag per person            a first-aid kit, including prescription medicines            emergency tools, including a battery-powered NOAA Weather Radio and a portable radio, flashlight, and plenty of extra batteries            an extra set of car keys and a credit card or cash            special items for infant, elderly, or disabled family members.                          IV. Practice and maintain your plan.  Ask questions to make sure your family remembers meeting places, phone numbers, and safety rules. Conduct drills. Test your smoke detectors monthly and change the batteries at least once a year. Test and recharge your fire extinguisher(s) according to manufacturer's instructions. Replace stored water and food every six months.

clueweb09-en0002-91-28715	"                                                                                                                                                     NOAA's  Geostationary and Polar-Orbiting    Weather Satellites        Operating the country's system of environmental ( weather ) satellites is one of the major responsibilities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS). NESDIS operates the satellites and manages the processing and distribution of the millions of bits of data and images theses satellites produce daily. The primary customer is NOAA's National Weather Service, which uses satellite data to create forecasts for the public, television, radio, and weather advisory services. Satellite information is also shared with various Federal agencies, such as the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Defense, and Transportation; with other countries, such as Japan, India, and Russia, and members of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office; and with the private sector.         NOAA's operational weather satellite system is composed of two types of satellites: geostationary operational environmental satellites (GOES) for short-range  warning and ""now-casting"" and polar-orbiting satellites for longer-term forecasting. Both types of satellite are necessary for providing a complete global weather  monitoring system.         A new series of GOES and polar-orbiting satellites has been developed for NOAA by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The new GOES-I through M series provide higher spatial and temporal resolution images and full-time operational soundings (vertical temperature and moisture profiles of the atmosphere). The newest polar-orbiting meteorological satellites (that began with NOAA-K in 1998) provide improved atmospheric temperature and moisture data in all weather situations. This new technology will help provide the National Weather Service the most advanced weather forecast system in the  world.       Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)                 GOES satellites provide the kind of continuous monitoring necessary for intensive data analysis. They circle the Earth in a geosynchronous orbit, which means they orbit the equatorial plane of the Earth at a speed matching the Earth's rotation. This allows them to hover continuously over one position on the surface. The geosynchronous plane is about 35,800 km (22,300 miles) above the Earth, high enough to allow the satellites a full-disc  view of the Earth. Because they stay above a fixed spot on the surface, they provide a constant vigil for the atmospheric ""triggers"" for severe weather conditions such as tornadoes, flash floods, hail storms, and hurricanes. When these conditions develop the GOES satellites are able to monitor storm development and track their movements.         GOES satellite imagery is also used to estimate rainfall during the thunderstorms  and hurricanes for flash flood warnings, as well as estimates snowfall accumulations and overall extent of snow cover. Such data help meteorologists issue winter storm warnings and spring snow melt advisories. Satellite sensors also detect ice fields and map the movements of sea and lake ice.         NASA launched the first GOES for NOAA in 1975 and followed it with another in 1977. Currently, the United States is operating GOES-10 and GOES-12. (GOES-9, which is partially operational, is being provided to the Japanese Meteorological Agency to replace their failing geostationary satellite.) GOES-11 is being stored in orbit as a replacement for GOES-12 or GOES-10 in the event of failure failure.       GOES-10 and GOES-12      The United States normally operates two meteorological satellites in geostationary orbit over the equator. Each satellite views almost a third of the Earth's surface: one monitors North and South America and most of the Atlantic Ocean, the other North America and the Pacific Ocean basin. GOES-12 (or GOES-East) is positioned at 75 W longitude and the equator, while GOES-10 (or GOES-West) is positioned at 135 W longitude and the equator. The two operate together to produce a full-face picture of the Earth, day and night. Coverage extends  approximately from 20 W longitude to 165 E longitude. This figure shows the coverage provided by each satellite.               The main mission is carried out by the primary instruments, the  Imager  and the  Sounder . The imager is a multichannel instrument that senses radiant energy and reflected solar energy from the Earth's surface and atmosphere. The Sounder provides data to determine the vertical temperature and moisture profile of the atmosphere, surface and cloud top temperatures, and ozone distribution.         Other instruments on board the spacecraft are a Search and Rescue transponder, a data collection and relay system for ground-based data platforms, and a space environment monitor. The latter consists of a magnetometer, an X-ray sensor, a high energy proton and alpha detector, and an energetic particles sensor. All are used for monitoring the near-Earth space environment or solar ""weather."" GOES-12, the newest satellite also carries a Solar X-Ray Imager (SXI).                          GOES-10 Characteristics                  Main body:        2.0m (6.6 ft) by 2.1m (6.9 ft) by 2.3m (7.5 ft)                  Solar array:        4.8m (15.8 ft) by 2.7m (8.9 feet)                  Weight at liftoff:        2105 kg (4641 pounds)                  Launch vehicle:        Atlas I                  Launch date:        April 25, 1997 Cape Canaveral Air Station, FL                  Orbital information:        Type: Geosynchronous       Altitude: 35, 786 km (22, 236 statute miles)       Period: 1,436 minutes       Inclination: 0.41 degrees                  Sensors:        Imager       Sounder       Space Environment Monitor (SEM)       Data Collection System (DCS)       Search and Rescue (SAR) Transponder                            The United States reaps many benefits from the new series of GOES satellites as they aid forecasters in providing better advanced warnings of thunderstorms, flash floods, hurricanes, and other severe weather. The GOES-I series provide meteorologists and hydrologists with detailed weather measurements, more frequent imagery, and new types of atmospheric soundings. The data gathered by the GOES satellites, combined with that from new Doppler radars and sophisticated communications systems make for improved forecasts  and weather warnings that save lives, protect property, and benefit agricultural and a variety of commercial interests.         For users who establish their own direct readout receiving station, the GOES satellites transmit low resolution imagery in the WEFAX service. WEFAX can be received with an inexpensive receiver. Highest resolution Imager and Sounder data is found in the GVAR primary data user service which requires more complex receiving equipment. More information about establishing receiving stations can be obtained from the Email contact at the bottom of the page.         For more detailed information about the GOES satellites, see the  GOES I-M DataBook ,  Revision 1, published 4 January 1997 by Space Systems-Loral. The most recent pictures received from the directly from the NOAA GOES satellites can be found at the  NOAA GOES Server .      Polar-Orbiting Satellites                 Complementing the geostationary satellites are two polar-orbiting satellites known as Advanced Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS-N or ATN), constantly circling the Earth in an almost north-south orbit, passing close to both poles. The orbits are circular, with an altitude between 830 (morning orbit) and 870 (afternoon orbit) km, and are sun synchronous. One satellite crosses the equator at 7:30 a.m. local time, the other at 1:40 p.m. local time. The circular orbit permits uniform data acquisition by the satellite and efficient control of the satellite by the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations located near Fairbanks, Alaska and Wallops Island, Virginia. Operating as pair, these satellites ensure that data for any region of the Earth are no more than six hours old.         A suite of instruments is able to measure many parameters of the Earth's  atmosphere, its surface, cloud cover, incoming solar protons, positive ions, electron-flux density, and the energy spectrum at the satellite altitude. As a part of the mission, the satellites can receive, process and retransmit data from Search and Rescue beacon transmitters, and automatic data collection platforms on land, ocean buoys, or aboard free-floating balloons. The primary instrument aboard the satellite is the  Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer  or AVHRR.          Data from all the satellite sensors is transmitted to the ground via a broadcast  called the High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT). A second data tranmission consists of only image data from two of the AVHRR channels, called Automatic Picture Transmission (APT). For users who want to establish their own direct readout receiving station, low resolution imagery data in the APT service can be received witn inexpensive equipment, while the highest resolution data transmitted in the HRPT service utilizes a more complex receiver. Additional information about establishing receiving station can be obtained from the Email contact below.                           NOAA-15 Characteristics                  Main body:        4.2m (13.75 ft) long, 1.88m (6.2 ft) diameter                  Solar array:        2.73m (8.96 ft) by 6.14m (20.16 ft)                  Weight at liftoff:        2231.7 kg (4920 pounds) including 756.7 kg of     expendable fuel                  Launch vehicle:        Lockheed Martin Titan II                  Launch date:        May 13, 1998 Vandenburg Air Force Base, CA                  Orbital information:        Type: sun synchronous       Altitude: 833 km       Period: 101.2 minutes       Inclination: 98.70 degrees                   Sensors:        Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/3)       Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A)       Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B)       High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS/3)       Space Environment Monitor (SEM/2)       Search and Rescue (SAR) Repeater and Processor       Data Collection System (DCS/2)                            The polar orbiters are able to monitor the entire Earth, tracking atmospheric variables and providing atmospheric data and cloud images. They track weather conditions that eventually affect the weather and climate of the United States. The satellites provide visible and infrared radiometer data that are used for imaging purposes, radiation measurements, and temperature profiles. The polar orbiters' ultraviolet sensors also provide ozone levels in the atmosphere and are able to detect the ""ozone hole"" over Antarctica during mid-September to mid-November. These satellites send more than 16,000 global measurements daily via NOAA's CDA station to NOAA computers, adding valuable information for forecasting models, especially for remote ocean areas, where conventional data are lacking.         Currently, NOAA is operating five polar orbiters. A new series of polar orbiters, with improved sensors, began with the launch of NOAA-15 in May 1998 and NOAA-16 on September 21, 2000. The newest, NOAA-17, was launched June 24, 2002.NOAA-12, NOAA-14 and NOAA-15 all continue transmitting data as stand-by satellites. NOAA-16 and NOAA-17 are classified as the ""operational"" satellites.         Find out about the  first United States weather satellite  launched  in 1960. For more technical information on the NOAA polar-orbiting  satellites, see the  NOAA-KLM User's Guide , and the NOAA - L Advanced TIROS-N (ATN)  Pamphlet . Link to the  USGS site  for more  information about the AVHRR instrument.      How Satellites Are Named      NOAA assigns a letter to the satellite before it is launched, and a number once it has achieved orbit. For example, GOES-H, once in orbit, was designated GOES-7, GOES-G, which was lost at launch, was never assigned a number. The same system is used for polar orbiters; for example, NOAA-11, still in orbit, was designated NOAA-H before launch. NOAA-J became NOAA-14.

Thunderstorms affect relatively small areas when compared with             hurricanes and winter storms. The typical thunderstorm is 15 miles             in diameter and lasts an average of 30 minutes. Despite their small             size, ALL thunderstorms are dangerous! Of the estimated 100,000 thunderstorms             that occur each year in the United States, about 10 percent are classified             as severe.      Tornadoes -  Although tornadoes occur in many parts of the   world, they are found most frequently in the United States.....                               Union City, Oklahoma tornado.  Learn more...                                                          A tornado is a violently rotating column of air extending                     from a thunderstorm to the ground.               Tornadoes cause an average of 70 fatalities and 1,500 injuries               in the U.S. each year..               The strongest tornadoes have rotating winds of more than 250               mph.                Tornadoes can be one mile wide and stay on the ground over 50               miles.               Tornadoes may appear nearly transparent until dust and debris               are picked up or a cloud forms within the funnel. The average tornado               moves from southwest to northeast, but tornadoes have been known               to move in any direction.               The average forward speed is 30 mph but may vary from nearly               stationary to 70 mph.                Waterspouts are tornadoes which form over warm water. They can               move onshore and cause damage to coastal areas.                          Lightning...                                             Causes an average of 80 fatalities and 300 injuries each                     year.               Lightning occurs in all thunderstorms; each year lightning strikes               the Earth 20 million times.               The energy from one lightning flash could light a 100-watt light               bulb for more than 3 months.               Most lightning fatalities and injuries occur when people are               caught outdoors in the summer months during the afternoon and evening.               Lightning can occur from cloud-to-cloud, within a cloud, cloud-to-ground,               or cloud-to-air.               Many fires in the western United States and Alaska are started               by lightning.               The air near a lightning strike is heated to 50,000°F--hotter               than the surface of the sun!               The rapid heating and cooling of the air near the lightning channel               causes a shock wave that results in thunder.                         Straight-line Winds...                                 Straight-line winds are responsible for most thunderstorm                     wind damage.               Winds can exceed 100 mph!               One type of straight-line wind, the downburst, is a small area               of rapidly descending air beneath a thunderstorm                A downburst can cause damage equivalent to a strong tornado and               can be extremely dangerous to aviation.                A “dry microburst” is a downburst that occurs with               little or no rain. These destructive winds are most common in the               western United States                         Flash Flooding...                                Is the #1 cause of deaths associated with thunderstorms...more                     than 140 fatalities each year               Most flash flood fatalities occur at night and most victims are               people who become trapped in automobiles.                Six inches of fast-moving water can knock you off your feet;               a depth of two feet will cause most vehicles to float.                         Hail...                                Strong rising currents of air within a storm, called updrafts,                     carry water droplets to a height where freezing occurs.               Ice particles grow in size, becoming too heavy to be supported               by the updraft, and fall to the ground.               Causes more than $1 billion in damage to property and crops each               year.               Large stones fall at speeds faster than 100 mph.

The  National Severe                 Storms Laboratory  is one of NOAA's internationally                 known research laboratories, leading the way in investigations                 of all aspects of severe weather. Headquartered in Norman OK,                 the people of NSSL, in partnership with the National Weather                 Service, are dedicated to improving severe weather warnings and                 forecasts in order to save lives and reduce property damage.               Severe weather research conducted at  NSSL  has             led to substantial improvements in severe and hazardous weather forecasting             resulting in increased warning lead times to the public. NSSL scientists             are exploring new ways to improve our understanding of the causes             of severe weather and ways to use weather information to assist National             Weather Service forecasters, as well as federal, university and private             sector partners.                            The  Storm Prediction Center             (SPC)  is part of the National Weather Service (NWS)             and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The             mission of the SPC is to provide timely and accurate forecasts and             watches for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes over the contiguous             United States. The SPC also monitors heavy rain, heavy snow, and             fire weather events across the U.S. and issues specific products             for those hazards.                    Weather Forecast   Offices  of NOAA’s National Weather Service issue local Severe   Thunderstorm, Tornado and Flash Flood warnings. Severe thunderstorm, tornado,   and flash flood warnings are passed to local radio and television stations   and are broadcast over local NOAA Weather Radio stations serving the warned   areas. These warnings are also relayed to local emergency management and public   safety officials who can activate local warning systems to alert communities.             NOAA Weather Radio is the best means to receive warnings from the             National Weather Service.             The National Weather Service continuously broadcasts warnings and             forecasts that can be received by NOAA Weather Radios, which are             sold in many stores. The average range is 40 miles, depending on             topography. Purchase a radio that has a battery back-up and a Specific             Area Message Encoder feature, which automatically alerts you when             a watch or warning is issued for your county or parish.                             When conditions are favorable for severe weather to develop,             a severe thunderstorm or tornado  WATCH  is issued.             Weather Service personnel use information from weather radar, spotters,             and other sources to issue severe thunderstorm and tornado  WARNINGS  for             areas where severe weather is imminent. Severe thunderstorm and tornado             warnings are passed to local radio and television stations and are             broadcast over local NOAA Weather Radio stations serving the warned             areas. These warnings are also relayed to local emergency management             and public safety officials who can activate local warning systems             to alert communities. If a tornado warning is issued for your area             or the sky becomes threatening, move to your pre-designated place             of safety.                            Check with your local National Weather Service office or visit             the Internet site to determine if your county is covered by  NOAA             Weather Radio . National Weather Service watches and warnings             are also available on the Internet by selecting your  local             National Weather Service office  at or by going to the  National             Weather Service Home Page.             Terms to know:                                   Tornado  - A violently rotating column of                     air, usually pendant to a cumulonimbus, with circulation                     reaching the ground. It nearly always starts as a funnel                     cloud and may be accompanied by a loud roaring noise. On                     a local scale, it is the most destructive of all atmospheric                     phenomena                                           Severe Thunderstorm  - A thunderstorm that                     produces a tornado, winds of at least 58 mph (50 knots),                     and/or hail at least ¾"" in diameter. Structural                     wind damage may imply the occurrence of a severe thunderstorm.                     A thunderstorm wind equal to or greater than 40 mph (35 knots)                     and/or hail of at least ½"" is defined as approaching                     severe.                                           Flash Flood -  A flood which is caused by                     heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally                     less than 6 hours. Also, at times a dam failure can cause                     a flash flood, depending on the type of dam and time period                 during which the break occurs.                                     Tornado Watch :                 Tornadoes are possible in your area. Remain alert for approaching                 storms. Know what counties or parishes are in the watch area                 by listening to NOAA Weather Radio or your local radio/television                 outlets.                                      Severe Thunderstorm Watch : Tells you when                     and where severe thunderstorms are likely to occur.

Just the evening before, a powerful tornado packing winds of more than 260 miles per hour ripped a swath a mile wide through Oklahoma City and its suburbs, chewing up homes and trucks in its path.      The deadliest tornadoes to strike Oklahoma in more than 50 years, these forceful twisters served as a fresh reminder of the wonderful, horrible power of nature.   It also serves as a warning for the rest of us of the need to prepare against nature's grandest atmospheric force, the tornado.  At their greatest strength, twisters can approach speeds of 320 miles per hour - enough power to level the best-constructed brick walls, rip large homes from their foundations and up into the air, and throw tractor-trailers a distance of about 300 feet.   The greatest and most frequent tornado occurrences happen in the United States.  Tornadoes can in fact form in any state, but they occur most frequently in  Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas.   Whether you live in this group of states - often called ""Tornado Alley"" - or not, spring brings the increased possibility of a deadly tornado. Are you prepared?   Secrets of Survival  will help you learn about the atmospheric events that signal the possibility of a tornado, and what safety measures you can take to survive if a twister hits.         'The Finger of God'    The National Weather Service defines a tornado as ""a violently rotating column of air pendant from a thunderstorm cloud and touching the ground.""   The Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA)  has a longer but much clearer definition:   A tornado is a violent windstorm characterized by a twisting,             funnel-shaped cloud. It is spawned by a thunderstorm (or sometimes as a result of a hurricane) and produced when cool air overrides a layer of warm air, forcing the warm air to rise rapidly. The damage from a tornado is a result of the high wind velocity and wind-blown debris. Tornado season is generally March through August, although tornadoes can occur at any time of year. They tend to occur in the afternoons and evenings: over 80 percent of all tornadoes strike between noon and midnight.    Each year, about 100,000 thunderstorms form over the United States. Between 600 and 1,000 of those thunderstorms will give birth to tornadoes.   Some may also remember the now famous quote from the film 'Twister', when a character asked a group of meteorologists following a series of tornadoes - ""storm chasers"" - how they would define the strongest twisters. After a moment of silence, one of them replies with a depth of feeling approaching awe that such an event is ""the finger of God.""   That's a high statement. But there's something about the greatest tornadoes that makes the highness hard to dismiss.   Some quick facts:   *Tornadoes are the most destructive of all weather-related events, and produce the most violent winds on earth. Winds inside the greatest twisters can swirl well over 300 mph.   *Tornadoes can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Some are composed almost entirely of windblown dust; others can be composed of several mini-funnels.   *Twisters can reach heights of 60,000 feet into the atmosphere.   *On average, during a tornado's 'path' - the total area certain to suffer at least some destruction by its deadly force - the twister will travel about 4 miles on the ground and cut a swath about 400 yards wide; but the worst ones can travel for 100 miles and be as large as a mile wide.   *The average tornado travels along the ground at a speed of 25 to 40 mph., but can go from one place to the next at speeds of up to 70 mph.   *Twisters stay on the ground for an average of four to five minutes; however, a tornado can touch down several times.   *Most tornadoes move from southwest to northeast.   *Most twisters in the Northern Hemisphere rotate in a counter-clockwise direction. Most in the Southern Hemisphere rotate in a clockwise direction.   *Building damage during a tornado happens when high winds cause a buildup of pressure on building surfaces. This pressure is wind velocity squared.   *Most tornadoes occur between 3 pm and 7 pm   *Tornadoes occur throughout the world; however, the greatest number and most intense, deadly  tornadoes occur in the United States.   *About 800 tornadoes touch down in the United States each year.   *Half of all tornadoes occur during the spring months of April, May, and June.   *Only 2 percent of tornadoes are considered violent, but those storms cause 70 percent of tornado-related deaths.   *In November 1988, a rash of 121 tornadoes struck 15 south central states, resulting in 14 lives lost and damages reaching $108 million.   *According to the National Weather Service, about 42 people are killed because of tornadoes each year.   Luckily, we are not mere sitting ducks, even against something as powerful and unpredictable as a twister.  Every year, scientists and meteorologists are learning more about the formation and behavior of the mighty winds. This has resulted in quicker and more reliable emergency broadcasts accurately predicting where a tornado will appear and its probable path.   For instance, the quick reports of twisters possibly headed into the heart of Oklahoma City in May of '99 certainly saved many lives. Those reports were only possible because of what had been learned about twisters in the early and mid-90s.   Also, the fact that tornadoes usually strike between 3-7 pm gives us a fairly certain time frame in which to look out for them, and ensures us that most people will be awake and will probably hear reports immediately if a dangerous situation arises.   And in the US, if a situation begins as we're outside away from a radio or TV or when we're asleep, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather alert radio receiver - equipped with the famous warning siren - can warn of an impending tornado if people are away from the usual immediate sources.       The Fujita - Pearson (FPP) Tornado Scale    Shortly, this is a system of estimating and reporting both tornadic wind intensity, devised by Professor T. Theodore Fujita (1920-1998), and path length and width by Allen Pearson in 1971.  It was quickly taken up as the best means to rate a twister's destructive capacity.  The scale is based on the damage a tornado causes on man-made structures.   According to Fujita and Pearson, the size of a tornado's funnel is  not  an indication of its intensity. The Fujita Scale is therefore based on damage, not the appearance of the funnel.   *F0 - Gale Tornado 40-72 mph  Path length 0.3-0.9 miles; path width 6-17 yards     Light damage; Some damage to chimneys; branches broken off trees; shallow-rooted trees pushed over; sign boards damaged.   F1 - Moderate Tornado (73 - 112 mph)  Path length: 1.0-3.1 miles; path width: 18-55 yards    Moderate damage; The lower limit is the beginning of hurricane wind speed; peels surface off roofs; mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned; moving autos pushed off the road; attached garages may be destroyed.   F2 - Significant Tornado (113 - 157 mph)  Path length: 3.2-9.9 miles; path width: 56-175 yards    Considerable damage; entire roofs torn from frame houses; mobile homes demolished; boxcars pushed over; large trees snapped or uprooted; light-object missiles generated.   F3 - Severe Tornado (158 - 206 mph)  Path length: 10-31 miles; path width: 176-566 yards    Severe damage; walls torn from well-constructed houses; trains overturned; most trees in forests uprooted; heavy cars lifted off ground and thrown.   F4 - Devastating Tornado (207 - 260 mph) Path length: 32-99 miles; path width: 0.3-0.9 miles    Well-constructed houses leveled; structures with weak foundations blown off some distance; cars thrown and large missiles generated.   F5 - Incredible Tornado (261 - 318 mph) Path length: 100-315 miles; path width: 1.0-3.1 miles    Strong frame houses lifted off foundations and carried considerable distances to disintegrate; automobile-sized missiles fly through the air 100 yards or more; trees debarked; steel reinforced concrete structures badly damaged.        Since we are going on about the awesome power that a tornado can bring, we at  Secrets of Survival  should definitely live up to our name and remind our readers that under  no  circumstances should they ever attempt to follow or chase a twister down.  They are, for all practical purposes, still quite unpredictable, and may surge with far greater strength, disappear and reappear, or change direction at a moment's notice.   We are a survival site, and so the very best advice we can give is to  let the storm chasing to those who are either sufficiently trained, or simply stupid enough, to follow one of these things . You're not actors on a movie set; there is no take two in real-life.  Your only worry should be to protect yourself, those you care for, and your home as best you can.  How do you do that?       Protecting Yourself Against the Twister    Many thanks here to both the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the  Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) for their detailed information on how one can best prepare for a twister - before it hits, as it's sweeping over you, and immediately after the event.   Many may suppose that they need only worry about the funnel cloud as it sweeps over them; but without the right preparations beforehand or maintaining the correct behavior afterward, a person could still easily end up becoming one of those injured, if not worse.  Avoid such problems by knowing what to do  before it happens .   Before a Tornado    The best precautions before a twister hits:   Determine the best location in both your home and place of employment in which to seek shelter when threatened by a tornado. A basement or cellar will usually afford the best protection. If an underground shelter is not available, identify an interior room or hallway on the lowest floor.   Conduct periodic tornado safety drills with your family.   Especially if you live in 'tornado alley', you should know the locations of designated shelters in places where you and your family spend time, such as public buildings, nursing homes and shopping centers. Ask whether your children's' schools have identified shelter space.   Have emergency supplies on hand.   Learn how to shut off the utilities to your home.   Decide how and when your family will reunite, if separated.   Make an inventory of your possessions. Take photographs of or videotape your belongings. Keep records in a safe deposit box or some other safe place away from the premises.   Here's an idea; purchase a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio with battery backup and tone-alert feature which automatically alerts you when a Watch or Warning is issued. Or simply purchase a battery-powered commercial radio, and extra batteries. Whichever you use, make sure from time to time that you know where the radio is, that it still works, and that all the batteries are still good.   Make sure you know the names of the towns and counties in which you live, work and haunt. They are used during both tornado warnings and watches to identify the area of potential tornadoes; therefore a solid knowledge here is essential. Keep a good, easy-to-read map in your car if you travel frequently, one that clearly details names of counties - which authorities use as the principal markers in spotting tornado activity - as well as towns.   Also, remember the terms used to describe tornado threats: Tornado Watch and Tornado Warning. What's the difference?   A  tornado watch  is issued by the National Weather Service when  tornadoes are possible in your area. Remain alert for approaching storms. This is the time to remind family members where the safest places within your home are located.   During a tornado watch, observe the sky and listen to radio or television for more information. Be prepared to take shelter. If you see any revolving funnel-shaped clouds, report them immediately by telephone to your local law enforcement agency. If they appear to be headed your way, seek shelter in a well-constructed, sturdy building or structure as soon as possible.   For some reason, God seems to hate mobile homes. In all honesty though, if you do live in a mobile home,  this  is the time to temporarily move to a more substantial structure. Many advise either moving to such a location or going outside, lying down in a 'low-lying area' and waiting for the 'Finger of God' to strike only after tornadoes begin appearing around your location. But to us here at  Secrets of Survival , that smacks of last-minute desperation.   Besides, we never much cared for lying in ditches anyway - not if we could ever avoid it, ant any rate. Don't wait till the last minute. Make sure you, and those you care for, are protected. If you live in a mobile home, move to a more substantial structure during a tornado watch and stay there until the watch has passed.   A  tornado warning  however is issued when a tornado has been actually sighted or indicated by weather radar. During a tornado warning, everyone should take shelter, turn on a battery-operated radio or television, and wait for the ""all clear"" announcement by authorities.   If you've heard there's a tornado warning in your area, call your local emergency management office or American Red Cross chapter about it if you care to know more. Also ask about community warning signals.   If there's one thing we can't stress enough, it's that you need to have your wits about you, and use all your senses in determining any danger. If you know there's a tornado warning in your area and the skies around you look particularly dark, or there seems to have been a sudden drop in barometric pressure, seek shelter immediately. Take along at least a radio (any one will do but an NOAA radio would admittedly be best) and some water if you can.   Watch for any unusual behavior out of animals: does your dog or cat seem particularly anxious? Does there seem to be a sudden drop of birds in your area, especially since the skies have become darker or the pressure has fallen? That may also be a good indication that a twister is about to appear in your immediate area. Seek shelter when you can, taking with you the things mentioned above.   If there's one constant with a twister, it's the sound that accompanies the tornado: it has most often been described as a deep rumble that builds into a roar.   Even if there hasn't been a tornado watch called in your area, if there is at least a tornado warning in your county or if the skies seem particularly ominous and the air possesses that drop in air pressure, and you begin to hear such a steady sound,  seek shelter immediately .  Unless you live next to a train station or airport runway (the sound of a twister has been compared to the long, low rumble of a speeding train more than anything else), you should not be hearing such a sound.   Don't bother to go outside and investigate; it may be too late for that.  The suddenness with which a twister can attack deserves special consideration when we know there's such a weather problem anywhere in our immediate area.   The simplest advice? Be ready to take shelter if and when the need calls for it.        During a Tornado    When a tornado has been sighted in your immediate area take the following actions:   At Home    Go at once to your predetermined shelter (the basement, storm cellar, or the lowest level of the building). Stay there until the danger has passed.  If there is no basement, go to an inner hallway or a small inner room without windows, such as a bathroom or closet.   However much you want to see the storm, stay away from all windows, doors, and outside walls.   Go directly to the center of the room. Stay away from corners because they tend to attract debris. Get under a piece of sturdy furniture such as a workbench or heavy table and hold on to it for all you're worth.   Use sofa cushions or your arms to protect your head and neck.   If in a mobile home, get out and seek shelter elsewhere. A mobile home can overturn very easily even if precautions have been taken to tie down the unit. If there isn't a substantial shelter nearby, seek shelter in a low-lying area. Use your arms to protect your head and neck.   In a Public Building (School, Hospital, Factory, Shopping Center, etc.)    Go to the basement or to an inside hallway, a small, interior room, or a bathroom or closet on the lowest possible level.   Avoid places with wide-span roofs such as auditoriums, cafeterias, gymnasiums, and large hallways.   Stay away from windows and open spaces.   Get under a piece of sturdy furniture such as a workbench or heavy table or desk and hold on to it.   Outdoors    If possible, get inside a substantial building.   If shelter is not available or there is no time to get indoors, lie in a ditch, culvert, or low-lying area or crouch near a strong building. Use your arms to protect your head and neck. Be alert for potential flash flooding.   In A Vehicle    Never  try to outrun a tornado in a vehicle. Heavy rain, hail, and traffic may impede your movement, and tornadoes can travel as quickly as 70mph over dry land. Tornadoes can quickly change directions, and can easily lift up a vehicle and toss it through the air.   Pull to the side of the road avoiding trees, power lines and other objects that could fall or be hazardous.   Get out of the vehicle immediately and try to take shelter in a nearby building.   If there isn't time to get indoors, get out of the vehicle and lie in a ditch, culvert, or low-lying area away from the vehicle. Use your arms to protect your head and neck.        After a Tornado    Monitor the radio or television for emergency information or instructions.   Check for injured victims. Render first aid if necessary.   Do not attempt to move severely injured victims unless absolutely necessary. Wait for emergency medical assistance to arrive.   Look out for broken glass and downed power lines.   Use the telephone only for emergency calls.   Try to get out of damaged buildings. Once out, do not reenter unless it's absolutely necessary. Use great caution at all times.   Take photos or videotape the damage to your home or property.   If driving, be alert for hazards in the roadway.   Check on neighbors/relatives who may require special assistance.   If unaffected by the tornado, stay out of the damaged area until allowed in by officials; your presence may hamper emergency operations.        The Most Important Reminders    1.The best protection during a tornado is in an interior room on the lowest level of a building, preferably a safe room.   2.Tornadoes strike with incredible velocity. Wind speeds may approach 320 miles per hour. These winds can uproot trees and structures and turn harmless objects into deadly missiles, all in a matter of seconds. Mobile homes are particularly vulnerable to tornadoes.   3.Injury or deaths related to tornadoes most often occur when buildings collapse, people are hit by flying objects or are caught trying to escape the tornado in a car.   4.Tornadoes are most destructive when they touch ground. Normally a tornado will stay on the ground for no more than 20 minutes; however, one tornado can touch ground several times in different areas.   5.Tornadoes can occur practically anywhere, but are most prevalent in the US, and are most frequent in the Midwest, Southeast and Southwest. The states of Oklahoma, South Dakota, Missouri, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas are at greatest risk.       Raising Awareness    The media can raise awareness about tornadoes by providing important information to the community. A few quick suggestions:   1.Publish a special section in your local newspaper with emergency information about tornadoes. Localize the information by printing the phone numbers of local emergency services offices, the American Red Cross, and hospitals.   2.Periodically inform your community of local public warning systems.   3.Sponsor a ""Helping Your Neighbor"" program at your local schools to encourage children to think of those persons who require special assistance such as elderly people, infants, or people with disabilities.   4.Conduct a series on how to protect yourself during a tornado in case you are at home, in a car, at the office, or outside.   5.Interview local officials about what people living in mobile home parks should do if a tornado warning is issued.        Many homes in the US 'Deep South' are for some reason built without a basement - a fact that is particularly strange since so many southern states are part of 'tornado alley'. In apparent response to this, a word from FEMA:   FEMA is urging people who live in tornado-prone areas to make sure they have a tornado-safe place to go during a tornado. In the absence of a basement, a tornado-safe room build within the house will protect your family during a tornado. Properly built safe rooms can provide protection against winds of 250 miles per hour and against flying objects traveling at 100 miles per hour. The plans for the safe rooms were developed along with the Wind Engineering Research Center of Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas.

Since we're passing out links, we thought it a good idea to pass on a few links to some excellent sites that give the reader interesting tornado information as well. Enjoy.   Tornado Project Online  - This is the definitive site for tornado information. If you can't find it anywhere else, you'll probably find it here.   Storm Prediction Center  - This National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association site provides lots of interesting and useful information about severe storms, including tornadoes.   WeatherOnline  - This is a fine source for up-to-the-minute weather information.   National Weather Service (Interactive Weather Information Network (IWIN))  - This is another good source for current weather information.

They generally occur during spring and summer, although they can happen in every season. Tornadoes can strike at any time of the day or night but are most likely between 3:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. No areas are immune to tornadoes; they have been reported in mountains and valleys, over deserts and swamps, from the Gulf Coast into Canada, in Hawaii, and even in Alaska. Regardless of the location or time of year, if conditions are right, a tornado can develop. More than 1,000 tornadoes are reported annually nationwide, and as our tornado detection systems improve, fewer tornadoes go undetected.               Even so, tornadoes sometimes develop in areas in which no tornado watch or warning has been issued.               A tornado is a violently rotating column of air extending from the base of a thunderstorm to the ground. Tornado intensities are classified on the Fujita Scale with ratings between 0 and 5. A storm of F0 is the weakest and F5 is the strongest. The most violent tornadoes have rotating winds of 250 miles (402 kilometers) per hour or more. These are capable of destroying well-made structures, uprooting trees, and hurling normally harmless objects through the air like deadly missiles. Most tornadoes are rated F0 and F1, and these usually span just a few dozen yards and touch down only briefly. Highly destructive violent tornadoes—F4 and F5—can carve out paths more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) wide and 50 miles (80 kilometers) long. Although these violent tornadoes comprise only two percent of all tornadoes, they are responsible for nearly 70 percent of tornado-related fatalities.               Waterspouts are similar to tornadoes but form over a body of water. They are most common along the Florida Gulf and Atlantic coasts and southeastern states. In the western United States, waterspouts occur in connection with storms in the late fall or winter, a time when they are least expected. Waterspouts occasionally move inland becoming tornadoes, causing damage and injuries.               Each year, many people are killed or seriously injured by tornadoes despite advance warning. Some did not hear the warning, while others heard the warning but did not believe they were personally threatened. Timely tornado watches and warnings, combined with household preparedness, could save your life. Once you receive a warning or observe threatening skies, you must make the decision to take shelter before the tornado arrives. It could be the most important decision you will ever make.               Preparation                              Decide where family members, including pets, should gather during a tornado. The safest place to be is underground, or as low to the ground as possible, and away from all windows. If you have a basement or storm cellar, make it your safe place. If you do not have a basement or storm cellar, consider an interior bathroom, closet, or hallway on the lowest floor. Putting as many walls as you can between you and the outside will provide additional protection. Less than two percent of all tornadoes are powerful enough to destroy a sturdy building. Make sure there are no windows or glass doors in your safe place and keep this place uncluttered.                                           If you are in a high-rise building, pick a place in a hallway in the center of the building. You may not have enough time to go to the lowest floor. Center hallways are often the most structurally reinforced part of a building.                                           If you live in a mobile home, choose a safe place in a nearby sturdy building. A sturdy building provides greater protection. If your mobile home park has a designated shelter, make it your safe place. Mobile homes are much more vulnerable to strong winds than site-built structures. Prior to 1994, most mobile homes were not designed to withstand even moderate winds.                                           Learn about your community's warning system. Different communities have different ways of providing warnings. Many communities have sirens intended for outdoor warning purposes.                                           Use a NOAA (National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration [US]) Weather Radio to keep aware of watches and warnings while you are indoors.                                           Make sure all family members know the name of the county or parish where you live or are traveling, because tornado watches and warnings are issued for a county or parish by name.                                           Conduct periodic tornado drills, so everyone remembers what to do if a tornado approaches. Practice having everyone in the household go to your designated safe place.                                           Have everyone get under a sturdy piece of furniture, hold on with one hand, and protect his or her head and neck with the other. Practicing your plan makes the appropriate response more of a reaction, requiring less thinking time during an actual emergency.                                           Check at your workplace and your children's schools and day care centers to learn about their tornado emergency plans. Every building has different safe places. It is important to know where they are and how to get there in an emergency.                                           Discuss tornadoes with your family. Everyone should know what to do in case not all family members are together. Discussing disaster preparedness ahead of time helps reduce fear and lets everyone know what to do in a tornado situation.                            After a Tornado                              Continue listening to local radio or television stations or a NOAA Weather Radio for updated information and instructions. Access may be limited to some parts of the community or roads may be blocked.                                           Check for injuries. Give first aid and get help for injured or trapped persons. Taking care of yourself first will allow you to help others safely until emergency responders arrive.                                           Help people who require special assistance—infants, elderly people, those without transportation, large families who may need additional help in an emergency situation, people with disabilities, and the people who care for them.                                           Watch out for fallen power lines or broken gas lines and report them to the utility company immediately. Reporting potential hazards will get the utilities turned off as quickly as possible, preventing further hazard and injury.                                           Avoid damaged areas. Your presence might hamper rescue and other emergency operations and put you at further risk from the residual effects of tornadoes.                                           Stay out of damaged buildings.                                           If you are away from home, return only when authorities say it is safe.                                           Wear long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, and sturdy shoes. Cut/injured feet are the most common injury following a disaster.                                           Use battery-powered lanterns or flashlights when examining buildings. Battery-powered lighting is the safest and easiest. It protects the user, the building occupants, and the building from fire hazards. DO NOT USE CANDLES.                                           Examine walls, floors, doors, staircases, and windows to make sure that the building is not in danger of collapsing.                                           Look for fire hazards. There may be broken or leaking gas lines, or damage to electrical systems. Clean up spilled medications, bleaches, gasoline, or other flammable liquids immediately. Fire is the most frequent hazard following other disasters.                                           Check for gas leaks. If you smell, gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window and get everyone out quickly. Turn off the gas using the outside main valve if you can, and call the gas company from a neighbor's home. If you turn off the gas for any reason, it must be turned back on by a professional.                                           Look for electrical system damage. If you see sparks or broken or frayed wires, or if you smell burning insulation, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you have to step in water to get to the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician first for advice.                                           Electrical equipment should be checked and dried before being returned to service.                                           Watch for loose plaster, drywall, and ceilings that could fall.                                           Take pictures of the damage, both of the building and its contents, for insurance claims.                                           Use the telephone only for emergency calls. Telephone lines are frequently overwhelmed in disaster situations. They need to be clear for emergency calls to get through.                                           Watch your animals closely. Keep all your animals under your direct control. Your pets may be able to escape from your home or through a broken fence. Pets may become disoriented, particularly because tornadoes and the heavy rains that accompany them will usually affect scent markers that normally allow animals to find their homes. The behavior of pets may change dramatically after any disruption, becoming aggressive or defensive, so be aware of their well-being and take measures to protect them from hazards, including displaced wild animals, and to ensure the safety of other people and animals.

Tornadoes    are most likely to occur in the  right-front quadrant  of the hurricane.     However, they are also often found elsewhere  embedded in the rainbands ,    well away from the center of the hurricane.   Some    hurricanes seem to produce no tornadoes, while others develop multiple ones.    Studies have shown that more than half of the landfalling hurricanes produce    at least one tornado; Hurricane Buelah (1967) spawned 141 according to one study.    In general, tornadoes associated with hurricanes are less intense than those    that occur in the Great Plains (see the  Enhanced Fujita  Intensity Scale  from the  Storm Prediction  Center's website ).    Nonetheless, the effects of tornadoes, added to the larger area of hurricane-force    winds, can produce substantial damage.    We    have no way at present to predict exactly which storms will spawn tornadoes    or where they will touch down. The new Doppler radar systems have greatly improved    the forecaster's warning capability, but the technology usually provides lead    times from only a few minutes up to about 30 minutes. Consequently,  preparedness    is critical .    Tornado    Facts              When        associated with hurricanes, tornadoes are not usually accompanied by hail        or a lot of lightning, clues that citizens in other parts of the country        watch for.                Tornado        production can occur for days after landfall when the tropical cyclone remnants        maintain an identifiable low pressure circulation.                 They        can also develop at any time of the day or night during landfall. However,        by 12 hours after landfall, tornadoes tend to occur mainly during daytime        hours.              Fujita scale    The original Fujita scale (F-scale) was replaced with the  Enhanced Fujita scale   on February 1, 2007.  The Enhanced F-scale  still is a set of wind estimates (not measurements) based on damage.  It uses three-second gusts estimated at the point of  damage based on a judgment of 8 levels of damage to 28 indicators. These estimates vary with height and  exposure.  Important note:  The 3 second gust is not the same wind as in standard surface observations. Standard measurements are  taken by weather stations in open exposures, using a directly measured, ""one minute mile"" speed. The scale uses  actual damage to determine a tornado’s wind speed.

The rotating column, or vortex, forms inside the storm cloud (cumulonimbus), then grows downward until it touches the ground. When a tornado is visible but does not touch the ground, it is properly called a funnel cloud. A tornado in contact with a body of water is called a waterspout.   A tornado is capable of extreme damage because it packs very high wind speeds into a compact area. Tornadoes have been known to shatter buildings, drive straws through solid wood, lift locomotives from their tracks, and pull the water out of small streams. The United States experiences most of the world's tornadoes, averaging about 800 each year. Most of these tornadoes arise in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. On average, tornadoes are responsible for 80          Approaching tornado with distinctive funnel.  (Reproduced by permission of   Photo Researchers, Inc. )           deaths, 1,500 injuries, and millions of dollars of damage annually in the United States.   Tornado formation   Although tornadoes can occur at any time of the year, most form during the months of March through June, when conditions are right for the development of severe thunderstorms.   In a severe storm, rain that falls from a cloud causes downdrafts (sinking air) in the rear of the cloud. Meanwhile, the advancing edge of the storm has strong updrafts and humid air is pulled into the storm. As this humid air rises and cools, its water vapor condenses to form more water droplets, releasing heat in the process into the surrounding air. This latent heat, in turn, causes the air mass to rise ever more quickly, strengthening the storm.   As updrafts in a severe thunderstorm cloud get stronger, more air is pulled into the base of the cloud to replace the rising air. Some of this air may be rotating slightly since the air around the base of a thunderstorm always has a certain amount of vorticity or ""spin.""     Words to Know   Fujita Tornado Scale:  A scale of six categories that rates tornado wind speed based upon the observed destruction of the storm.   Funnel cloud:  A fully developed tornado vortex before it has touched the ground.   Latent heat:  The heat released when water vapor condenses to form liquid water.   Vortex:  A rotating column of a fluid such as air or water.   Vorticity:  The tendency of an air mass to rotate.   Waterspout:  Tornado in contact with a body of water.     As the air converges into a smaller area it begins to rotate faster due to a law of physics known as the conservation of angular momentum. This effect can be seen when an ice skater begins slowly spinning with arms outstretched. As the skater brings his or her arms inward, the skater's rate of rotation increases dramatically. In the same way, as air converges into the strong updraft of an intense thunderstorm, its rate of spin increases. Meteorologists still are unsure whether tornadoes form deep within clouds and extend downward or form underneath the cloud and extend upward. It is possible that both situations occur.   Tornado characteristics   Tornadoes move with the thunderstorm to which they are attached at an average speed of 35 miles (56 kilometers) per hour. They have an average path length of about 5 miles (8 kilometers). The diameter of a tornado can vary from 300 feet to 1 mile (90 meters to 1.6 kilometers). Tornadoes come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and often have an ominous dark color due to the soil and other debris they pick up as they move along.     Dust Devil   A dust devil is a relatively small, rapidly rotating wind that stirs up dust, sand, leaves, and other material as it moves across the ground. Dust devils also are known as whirlwinds or, especially in Australia, willy-willys. In most cases, dust devils are no more than 10 feet (3 meters) wide and less than 300 feet (100 meters) high.   Resembling mini-tornadoes, dust devils form most commonly on hot dry days in arid regions such as a desert. They originate when a layer of air lying just above the ground is heated and begins to rise in an updraft. Winds blowing in the area cause this rising air mass to rotate, either clockwise or counterclockwise. In some cases, wind speeds can easily exceed 50 miles (80 miles) per hour. Some large and powerful dust devils have been known to cause property damage. In the vast majority of cases, however, dust devils are too small to pose a threat to buildings or to human life.     Tornado strength is classified by the Fujita Tornado Scale, or F-scale. Developed by T. Theodore Fujita of the University of Chicago, the scale measures the power and destructiveness of tornadoes. The six categories of the scale (F0 through F5) classify a tornado by the amount of damage it causes—from light to incredible—and its wind speed—from 40 to more than 300 miles (64 to more than 482 kilometers) per hour. It is estimated that 90 percent of all tornadoes have wind speeds below 115 miles (185 kilometers) per hour.     Tornado history   The deadliest tornado in United States history was the Tri-State tornado on March 18, 1925. Beginning in Missouri, the tornado stayed on the ground for almost 220 miles (350 kilometers), moving into Illinois and Indiana. In places, it left a trail of damage almost 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) wide. The Tri-State tornado plowed through nine towns and destroyed thousands of homes. When the storm was over, 695 people had lost their lives and more than 2,000 were injured.   Another historic storm was the severe tornado outbreak of April 3-4, 1974. This so-called ""Super Outbreak"" triggered 148 tornadoes over 13 states, devastating an area from Alabama to Michigan. More than 300 people were killed and more than 5,000 were injured. Property damage was approximately $500 million.   On May 3, 1999, a storm started near the town of Lawton in southwestern Oklahoma. By the end of the day, it had grown into a violent storm system with a reported 76 tornadoes. As the storm system tore across central Oklahoma and into Kansas, more than 40 people were killed, over 500 were injured, and more than 1,500 buildings were destroyed. One of the tornadoes in the system, classified as an F5, had a diameter of 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) at times and stayed on the ground for more than 4 hours.   Tornado prediction and tracking   The precise tracking and prediction of tornadoes is not yet a reality. Meteorologists can identify conditions that are likely to lead to severe storms and can issue warnings when atmospheric conditions are right for the development of tornadoes. They can use radar to track the path of thunderstorms that might produce tornadoes. Yet it is still not possible to detect a funnel cloud by radar and predict its path, touchdown point, and other important details. Scientific research in this area continues.
