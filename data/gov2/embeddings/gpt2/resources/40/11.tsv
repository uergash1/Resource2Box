clueweb09-en0011-11-07992	                 Home     Archives     About   Contact   Free Mags   Geeky   Top Posts   Feed                     Significant Figures Calculator                       Javascript must be enabled in your web browser for this significant figures calculator to work.            Number:      Significant figures:    Least significant decimal:      Always display scientific notation.                  Instructions   The significant figures calculator should be displayed below. However, if you’re using Internet Explorer, rather than the far superior Firefox browser, calculator may not show up or may not work. In which case, apologies, and may I suggest you try this  link .   Enter the number that you wish to round to a given number of significant figures. E.g. enter 12345.678 and ask to round to four sig figs, the answer will be 12350.    When converting or manipulating measurements, your final result is  only as significant as your least significant value. So, if you see a phrase like “5 kg (or 11.023113 lbs)” that’s just plain wrong. The original kg value has only a single sig fig and so the conversion should only be given to one sig fig too, i.e. 5 kg is about 10 lbs.       When you’ve finished doing your sig figs calcs why not take the chance to subscribe to NASA’s  free Tech Briefs magazine , which offers newsbytes and features on all the math and engineering, science, and technology happening at NASA right now.               7 Comments                        7 responses so far ↓                                  sara lohse        //  Oct 22, 2008 at 5:12 pm                 wheres the calculator?!                                             David Bradley         //  Oct 22, 2008 at 6:42 pm                 Right there, below the words “Significant Figures Calculator”   You enter the number you want to round in the box below the word “Number” and fill in the options in the two boxes below. Click “Go” and the big box on the right of the calculator will display your number to the appropriate number of sig figs. Nothing could be simpler. It’s not a calculator in the sense of a  scientific calculator                                            zak        //  Nov 4, 2008 at 1:18 pm                 where is the calculator?????                                             David Bradley         //  Nov 4, 2008 at 2:40 pm                 Zak…you’re only the second person to ask this question in the two years since I installed the calculator. I’m really not sure how to respond. The calculator is right there at the top, just below the phrase Significant Figures Calculator. If you’re looking for a keypad type input, it ain’t there, just enter your number to round and click go. Isn’t it obvious?                                            stan        //  Nov 13, 2008 at 7:27 am                 I mean no offense, but it seems your calculator doesn’t appear on some browsers.  Possibly mozilla vs IE?  I use IE.  Maybe it’s relatively recent, as the first comment is Oct 22.  It does not display on mine.  Popup blocker perchance?                                             David Bradley         //  Nov 13, 2008 at 8:37 am                 Hoist by my own petard. Yes, I see where you’re all coming from now…will investigate. Works perfectly in Firefox, to which I recommend all IE users switch if they can!

Behavioral Ecology Vol. 11 No. 5: 550-559  © 2000  International Society for Behavioral Ecology    Cue use affects resource subdivision among three coexisting hummingbird species      Elizabeth A. Sandlin      Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, The University of  Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA        Address correspondence to E. A. Sandlin at National Center for Ecological  Analysis and Synthesis, 735 State St., Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101.  E-mail:   sandlin{at}nceas.ucsb.edu   .     Competition for food can influence the coexistence of species   via habitat  selection, and learned behavior can influence foraging   decisions. I  investigated whether learned behavior and competition   act together to  influence species interactions between three   coexisting hummingbird species:  black-chinned ( Archilochus   alexandri ), blue-throated ( Lampornis  clemenciae ), and magnificent   ( Eugenes fulgens ) hummingbirds. I  found that color cue use   by individuals affects not only their foraging  choices but   also population-level responses to competition. I presented    hummingbirds two types of habitats (rich and poor feeders).   All birds shared a  preference for the rich feeders, but shifted   preference toward poor feeders in  response to competition.   I used color cues to manipulate the amount of  information available   to birds and examined the effects of two information  states   (complete or incomplete) on their foraging choices. I examined    hummingbirds' preferences for the rich feeders when both competitor   densities  and information varied. To relate foraging choices   to energetic intake, I also  analyzed energy gained during a   single foraging bout. Males of all species  exhibited strong   preferences for rich feeders when they foraged with complete    information and low competitor densities. Without complete information,   the  two subordinate species (black-chinned and magnificent)   shifted preference  away from rich feeders in response to high   densities of the dominant species  (blue-throated). Each subordinate   species shifted in a unique way:  black-chinned hummingbirds   reduced foraging efficiency, while magnificent  hummingbirds   reduced foraging time. Birds foraging with complete information    remained selective on rich feeders even at high competitor densities.   Thus,  learned information affected competitive interactions   (for rich feeders) among  these species.

ASI SIGS, which are organized by indexing specialty, serve as networking sources and marketing tools for their members. They do this by means of email lists, newsletters, brochures, and ASI meetings. SIGS can market their members' services in specific subject areas to targeted clients. In May, 2000, the ASI Board of Directors approved guidelines for SIGs which desire to formally affiliate with ASI. These guidelines are posted in the Members Area of this site. SIGs now affiliated with ASI are distinguished below; some SIGs are still discussing this option.       NOTE: for information on indexing SIGs in other organizations, take a look through our  Publishing Industry Organizations  pages.       For information on forming SIGs  see the Members Area of this site.                       Business (affiliated)     Contact: Stephanie Bush at  stephanie@wisewordsolutions.com    URL:  http://www.businessindexing.org    Fees: $20/year    The Business SIG began in July 2000 as a resource for indexers of business-related books. The SIG's mission is to provide members with publicity, information exchange, publisher/author information, professional development, and job referrals, and to advance awareness of quality indexes for business-related publications. Professional indexers and others interested in the indexing of business subjects such as (but not limited to) accounting, marketing, management, supervision, business law, finance, banking, or investing may be interested in joining this SIG.             Culinary (affiliated)     Contact: Lee Lawton at  llami@peak.org    URL:  www.culinaryindexing.org    Fees: $25/year     The Culinary Indexing SIG is an educational forum and a network for experienced and novice indexers interested in culinary indexing in various media, such as books, periodicals, CD-ROMs, and web sites. The SIG serves several functions. As an educational forum, it provides opportunities for members to ask questions and brainstorm about technical culinary indexing problems. It may make available actual instruction by experienced culinary indexers. As a network, it gives members access to information about publishers, authors, editors, and others who need culinary indexes in various media, such as books, periodicals, CD-ROMs, and web sites. Members also can use the network to find other culinary indexers to whom they refer projects. Network outreach to potential clients seeks to promote awareness of SIG members' competence, experience, and availability.    One of the members of the Culinary Indexing SIG, Therese Shere, presented a three-hour workshop on ""Cookbook Indexing"" at the ASI Boston Conference in June 2001; her workshop notes are available on the SIG listserv. In addition, the SIG has prepared marketing postcards mailed out by members in Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. These postcards mailed to culinary publishers and editors note that the SIG's listserv at yahoogroups.com accepts job postings, as well as pointing publishers and editors to the SIG's website at  www.culinaryindexing.org . This website includes an extensive selection of articles about culinary indexing, as well as the SIG Members Directory. The SIG has also placed a display ad in the  Publishers Weekly  cookbook edition for two years and we are always looking for other ways to amplify our marketing efforts.     The two criteria for SIG membership include            belonging to one of the six affiliated national indexing societies, and       paying US $25 annual dues         The dues pay for group marketing efforts undertaken through postal mail and the SIG website. The SIG treasurer's account at  www.paypal.com  accepts credit card payments and checking account debits from anywhere in the world for a small fee (thus avoiding the currency conversion expense).

We provide members with an online list of annual large conferences in history- and archaeology-related fields, their dates, locations, and websites, so that members can market themselves and/or the SIGs in person if the conferences are held near their homes.    We have a marketing flyer about the SIG on our website in PDF, which can be printed off to take to conferences or send to publishers or authors.    An article on the website explains why scholarly authors need professional indexers.    We have targeted publishers by postcards and flyers in the past and are considering other ways of reaching publishers in the future.         A YahooGroups email list enables us to figure out ways to achieve our goals, recognize volunteers or superlative indexers in our field, network, and publicize our services throughout the year.

Education in the Balance: A Report on the Academic Workforce in English                A new MLA-ADE staffing report documents the dramatic increase in the use of part-time and full-time non-tenure-track labor and the consequences of such employment practices for undergraduate education and for the future of tenured and tenure-track positions in English. The report provides recommendations for institutions on an educationally sound balance between tenured and tenure-track faculty members and non-tenure-track faculty members and recommendations for ensuring that non-tenure-track faculty members have the appropriate salaries and benefits, working conditions, and support. The report is accompanied by ""Demography of the Faculty: A Statistical Portrait of English and Foreign Languages,"" which draws on United States government data sources to provide an overview of the faculty population teaching English and foreign languages.                                           2008 MLA Annual Convention Program               2008 MLA Convention Program  is now available online to MLA members and nonmembers. The Program is searchable by participant, subject, meeting type, and keyword.

A brochure containing information on all sessions can be downloaded  here    and will also be available at the convention in San Francisco at the registration areas.                       Suggesting Members for Committee Appointments            When the Executive Council meets in February, it will make appointments to sixteen standing committees of the association.

MLA Bibliography  Adds Abstracts                Effective with its April 2008 online update, the  MLA International Bibliography  includes publisher-provided abstracts in its bibliographic citations.  The first group of over 9,000 abstracts, reprinted with permission of the publishers, comes from  PMLA , Project Muse, JSTOR, and  German Quarterly .

To get the free Acrobat Reader .     3. Select one copy or multiple copies.  For each article, choose whether you expect to print out a single copy and/or store the article on one computer,  or  want a license to print out up to 20 copies and/or store on more than one computer.  This is based on an honor system, which we trust you will adhere to . If, after ordering a single copy you decide you want to make additional copies of the article, please call our office (toll free in the U.S. at: 1-888-475-3328) to pay the balance due. For permission to print out more than 20 copies, also contact us. Outside the U.S., call: 802-864-9083.     4. Downloading your selections.  After you complete your order, the URLs for downloading the article(s) will be displayed on your screen along with a user name & password you will need to enter to access the download file (you should also receive this in an e-mail confirmation). We suggest you download the articles by clicking on the URLs when they are displayed. Depending on the length of the article, and the speed of your internet connection, an article will take anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes to download.    5. Questions / Problems Encountered?
