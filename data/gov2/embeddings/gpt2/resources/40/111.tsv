Traffic to the site increased 25% in March, which generated more than 10,000 leads, over 5 million page views and over 60,000 visitor hours on the site.      At the end of 2005, the Miami Herald ran a front-page article announcing the new company, which would revolutionize the way condos are marketed, bought and sold.  Condo.com has lived up to this prediction and is now creating a significant impact in a market that sorely needs positive results.  When the site launched in January 2006 it had 8,000 property listings on the site.  Today Condo.com has over 600,000 listings with inventory valued at $150 billion.

The company creates liquidity for sellers by attracting condo buyers from around the world that are looking for a superset of all available listings.  A review of Condo.com, and the opportunities it brings to the real estate market, gets even the worst real estate skeptics excited.

This database includes inventory from multiple sources including developers and lending institutions that are traditionally not available to consumer markets.  Developer listings, auctions and REO properties are where many of the hot deals are and these remain blind spots for other real estate websites.  Condo.com creates partnerships with developers and financial institutions and provides cost-effective marketing and sales support to market and sell their condo inventory.  Another distinct benefit is the ability to view entire buildings and associated unit inventory as well as entire streets and neighborhoods of condo buildings to see what is available.

One of the key advantages, aside from more free time, is that Destin Florida condos have been a great investment. They have held their value here as an investment despite economic downturns and problems with some associations. In fact, they have appreciated more in the last few years than when they first came on the scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s, experts say.   Economics  - It's advantageous because there is usually little or no land, so prices remain lower!   Value  - Get into a better Destin neighborhood because you've saved money on the condominium!    Low maintenance  - You don't have to pay a lot for ongoing upkeep.    Privacy  - Many owners enjoy better security, because the complex covers the security needs.    Facilities Amenities  - Destin complexes often come jam packed with facilities, from exercise equipment, fitness items, pools, saunas, and more. The best of all, you enjoy them but don't have to clean them!  More Leisure Time  - No or little time spent on maintenance.   Retiring?   The Destin Florida Emerald Coast is a fantastic place to retire. Great year round climate, lots of amenities, stunning beach views and activities to enjoy life to it's fullest!

South Beach offers an eclectic mix of world-class boutiques, galleries and stores, and rates as a culinary hot spot from gourmet to casual cuisine. But it is at night that South Beach really comes alive. According to several popular magazines, South Beach has replaced both Los Angeles and New York City as the premier and most popular nightlife spot in the U.S. It is host to over 150 clubs and other destinations.  South Beach (or the Beach as known to its locals) is a section of Miami Beach that encompasses the lower 23 blocks of the island from the point south of 1st Street to 23rd Street. This area was the first section of Miami Beach to be developed starting in the 1910s, thanks to development efforts of Carl G. Fisher, the Lummus Brothers, John Collins, and others. The area has gone through numerous changes over the years, some man-made and some due to the forces of nature. New developments include luxury penthouses, condos and villas with spectacular views of the Atlantic Ocean and the Miami skyline.  Let us help you find the home of your dreams in South Beach.

There are a few Florida beaches       that are more laid back, less developed and easier to       travel. One such location is Crescent Beach Florida. Most of       the condos at Crescent Beach are       oceanfront or intracoastal front condominiums. Another great       location for waterfront condos is St Augustine Florida.       There are many waterfront locations in      Saint Augustine that offer the small city atmosphere with an old       city charm. St Augustine is the nation's oldest city with       many attractions and unspoiled nature       preserves. Vilano Beach Florida is a small community just       south of Jacksonville. Vilano Beach condos are great for       second homes or rental condos.                                 Call Rick Ginn:cell phone: 904-669-8828toll free 800-883-6810 rickg@staugustinefl.cc                                                                                                                     Contact us            904-471-6600                Condo map                                                                                                       Florida Oceanfront Condos                                                                                                                                                 Anastasia Condo                                                                           Barefoot      Trace                                                                      Ocean      House                                                                                                                                                     Click on the photo to see what's for sale or on the       condo name to go to the web site.                                                                                                                                            Sand Dollar Condos                                                                                           Tradewinds Condo                                                                                      Windjammer Condo                                                                                                                                                                            Florida Beachfront Condos is a     web site designed to help buyers locate waterfront condos for sale.     Many of the beachfront condos in Florida are waterfront. However,     the term ""beachfront"" can be confusing. When we use the term     ""beachfront condos,"" we are referring to beachfront condominium     complexes. At a beachfront condo complex, some units are direct     oceanfront, while other units may be ocean view or have no ocean     view at all. If all of the units in a complex are direct oceanfront     condos, we call this an ""oceanfront"" complex. We hope this helps you     understand the difference between beachfront condos and oceanfront     condos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        St Augustine Beach condos                         Crescent Beach condos                         Investment Condos                                                                                                                                 904-471-6600                  searchlistings@gmail.com                                                                                                                                                                Privacy       Policy                  Terms & Conditions                             Copyright Landmark Realty, Inc.

In the  common law  systems personal property may also be called  chattels  or  personalty . It is distinguished from  real property , or  real estate . In the  civil law  systems personal property is often called  movable property  or  movables  - any property that can be moved from one location to another. This term is in distinction with  immovable property  or immovables, such as land and buildings.   Historically,  slaves  have often been legally treated as personal property. In some cultures, servants, wives and children have also been considered to greater or lesser degrees to be the personal property ( chattel ) of their husbands, fathers or guardians. For example, in Biblical times, the ancient Hebrews were permitted to sell their daughters into servitude, and servants could be bought or sold as slaves were - although Hebrew servants could not be legally sold to aliens, and male Hebrew servants were set free after serving for 7 years. (see Exodus 20 for details). Even in Victorian times, children could be bought and sold - as chronicled in  Charles Dickens 's novel  Oliver Twist .   Personal property may be classified in a variety of ways.  Tangible personal property  refers to any type of property that can generally be moved (i.e., it is not attached to real property or land), touched or felt. These generally include items such as furniture, clothing, jewelry, art, writings, or household goods. In some cases, there can be formal title documents that show the ownership and transfer rights of that property after a person's death (for example, motor vehicles, boats, etc.) In many cases, however, tangible personal property will not be ""titled"" in an owner's name and is presumed to be whatever property he or she was in possession of at the time of his or her death.   Intangible personal property  or ""intangibles"" refers to personal property that cannot be actually ""moved"" touched or felt, but instead represents something of value such as  negotiable instruments ,  securities ,  goods , and  intangible assets  including  chose in action .   Accountants also distinguish personal property from real property because personal property can be  depreciated  faster than improvements (while land is not depreciable at all). It is an owner's right to get tax benefits for chattel, and there are businesses that specialize in appraising personal property, or chattel.   The distinction between these types of property is significant for a variety of reasons. Usually one's rights on movables are more attenuated than one's rights on immovables (or real property). The  statutes of limitations  or  prescriptive periods  are usually shorter when dealing with personal or movable property. Real property rights are usually enforceable for a much longer period of time and in most jurisdictions real estate and immovables are registered in government-sanctioned land registers. In some jurisdictions, rights (such as a  lien  or other security interest) can be registered against personal or movable property.   In the common law it is possible to place a  mortgage  upon real property. Such mortgage requires payment or the owner of the mortgage can seek  foreclosure . Personal property can often be secured with similar kind of device, variously called a  chattel mortgage , trust receipt, or  security interest . In the United States, Article 9 of the  Uniform Commercial Code  governs the creation and enforcement of security interests in most (but not all) types of personal property.   There is no similar institution to the mortgage in the civil law, however a  hypothec  is a device to secure  real rights  against property. These real rights follow the property along with the ownership. In the common law a lien also remains on the property and it is not extinguished by alienation of the property; liens may be real or  equitable .   Many jurisdictions levy a personal  property tax , an annual tax on the privilege of owning or possessing personal property within the boundaries of the jurisdiction. Automobile and boat registration fees are a subset of this tax. Most household goods are exempt as long as they are kept or used within the household; the tax usually becomes a problem when the taxing authority discovers that expensive personal property like art is being regularly stored outside of the household.     [ edit ]   Personal vs Private property   In political/economic theory, notably  anarchism ,  communism  and some  socialist  philosophies, the distinction between private and personal property is extremely important. They are separated by a blurry boundary, which items of property constitute which is open to debate.     Personal property  is part of your person and includes property from which you have the right to exclude others (e.g TVs, cars, clothes etc). [ 1 ]       Private property  is a  social relationship , not a relationship between person and thing according to  Marx  (e.g factories, mines, dams, infrastructure etc). In  capitalism  there is no distinction between personal and private property. [ 2 ]       To many socialists, the term  private property  refers to capital or the means of production, while personal property refers to consumer and non-capital goods and services.

clueweb09-enwp01-67-09358	"                     Real estate appraisal          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Property valuation )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Real estate appraisal ,  property valuation  or  land valuation  is the practice of developing an opinion of the value of real property, usually its  Market Value . The need for appraisals arises from the heterogeneous nature of property as an investment class: no two properties are identical, and all properties differ from each other in their location - which is the most important determinant of their value. So there cannot exist a centralised  Walrasian auction  setting for the trading of property assets, as there exists for trade in corporate stock. The absence of a market-based pricing mechanism determines the need for an expert appraisal/valuation of real estate/property.   A real estate appraisal is performed by a licensed or certified appraiser (in many countries known as a  property valuer  or  land valuer  and in British English as a ""valuation surveyor""). If the appraiser's opinion is based on Market Value, then it must also be based on the  Highest and Best Use  of the  real property . For mortgage valuations of improved residential property in the US, the appraisal is most often reported on a standardized form, such as the  Uniform Residential Appraisal Report . [ 1 ]  Appraisals of more complex property (e.g. -- income producing, raw land) are usually reported in a narrative appraisal report.

Some of the most common are:     Market Value   The price at which an asset would trade in a competitive  Walrasian auction  setting. Market Value is usually interchangeable with  Open Market Value  or  Fair Value .  International Valuation Standards  (IVS) define Market Value as:           Market Value  is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgably, prudently, and without compulsion. [ 2 ]           Value-in-use   The net present value (NPV) of a cash flow that an asset generates for a specific owner under a specific use. Value-in-use is the value to one particular user, and is usually below the market value of a property.       Investment value  - is the value to one particular investor, and is usually higher than the market value of a property.       Insurable value  - is the value of real property covered by an  insurance policy . Generally it does not include the site value.       Liquidation value  -- may be analyzed as either a  forced liquidation  or an  orderly liquidation  and is a commonly sought standard of value in bankruptcy proceedings. It assumes a seller who is compelled to sell after an exposure period which is less than the market-normal timeframe.       [ edit ]   Price versus value   It is important to distinguish between  Market Value  and  Price . A price obtained for a specific property under a specific transaction may or may not represent that property's market value: special considerations may have been present, such as a special relationship between the buyer and the seller, or else the transaction may have been part of a larger set of transactions in which the parties had engaged. Another possibility is that a special buyer may have been willing to pay a premium over and above the market value, if his subjective valuation of the property (its  investment value  for him) was higher than the Market Value. An example of this would be the owner of a neighbouring property who, by combining his own property with the subject property, could thereby obtain economies-of-scale. Such situations often arise in corporate finance, as for example when a merger or acquisition is concluded at a price which is higher than the value represented by the price of the underlying stock. The usual rationale for these valuations would be that the 'sum is greater than its parts', since full ownership of a company entails special privileges for which a potential purchaser would be willing to pay. Such situations arise in real estate/property markets as well. It is the task of the real estate appraiser/property valuer to judge whether a specific price obtained under a specific transaction is indicative of Market Value.     [ edit ]   Market value definitions in the USA   In the US, appraisals are performed to a certain standard of value (e.g. -- foreclosure value, fair market value, distressed sale value, investment value). The most commonly used definition of value is  Market Value . While  USPAP  does not define Market Value, it provides general guidance for how Market Value should be defined:   a type of value, stated as an opinion, that presumes the transfer or sale of a property as of a certain date, under specific conditions set forth in the definition of the term identified by the appraiser as applicable in an appraisal.   Thus, the definition of value used in an appraisal or CMA analysis and report is a set of assumptions about the market in which the subject property may transact. It becomes the basis for selecting comparable data for use in the analysis. These assumptions will vary from definition to definition but generally fall into three categories:     [ edit ]   Three approaches to value   There are three general groups of methodologies for determining value. These are usually referred to as the ""three approaches to value"":     The  cost approach   The  sales comparison approach  and   The  income approach     However, the recent trend of the business tends to be clining to the scientific methodology of appraisal which lies on the foundation of quantitative-data  [ 3 ] , risk and geographical based approaches  [ 4 ] ,   [ 5 ] . Pagourtzi  et al.  have provided a review on the methods used in the industry by comparison between conventional approaches and advanced ones  [ 6 ] .   The appraiser using three approaches will determine which one or more of these approaches may be applicable, based on the scope of work determination, and from that develop an appraisal analysis. Costs, income, and sales vary widely from one situation to the next, and particular importance is given to the specific characteristics of the subject.   Consideration is also given to the market for the property appraised. Appraisals of properties that are typically purchased by investors (e.g. - skyscrapers) may give greater weight to the income approach, while small retail or office properties, often purchased by owner-users, may give greater weighting to the sales comparison approach. While this may seem simple, it is not always obvious. For example, apartment complexes of a given quality tend to sell at a price per apartment, and as such the sales comparison approach may be more applicable. Single family residences are most commonly valued with greatest weighting to the sales comparison approach, but if a single family dwelling is in a neighborhood where all or most of the dwellings are rental units, then some variant of the income approach may be more useful.     [ edit ]   The cost approach   The  cost approach  was formerly called the summation approach. The theory is that the value of a property can be estimated by summing the land value and the depreciated value of any improvements. The value of the improvements is often referred to by the abbreviation RCNLD (reproduction cost new less depreciation or replacement cost new less depreciation). Reproduction refers to reproducing an exact replica. Replacement cost refers to the cost of building a house or other improvement which has the same utility, but using modern design, workmanship and materials. In practice, appraisers use replacement cost and then deduct a factor for any functional disutility associated with the age of the subject property.   In most instances when the cost approach is involved, the overall methodology is a hybrid of the cost and sales comparison approaches. For example, while the replacement cost to construct a building can be determined by adding the labor, material, and other costs, land values and depreciation must be derived from an analysis of comparable data.   The cost approach is considered reliable when used on newer structures, but the method tends to become less reliable for older properties. The cost approach is often the only reliable approach when dealing with special use properties (e.g. -- public assembly, marinas).     [ edit ]   The sales comparison approach   Template:Comparitive Market Analysis   The  Comparitive Market Analysis (CMA)  examines the price or price per unit/SF area of similar properties being sold in the marketplace. * Similar properties are of similar square footage, number of levels, age of the home, condition of the home, and area proximity of the subject home. Simply put, the sales of properties similar to the subject are analyzed and the sale prices adjusted to account for differences in the comparables to the subject to determine the value of the subject. This approach is generally considered the most reliable if adequate comparable sales exist. In any event, it is the only independent check on the reasonability of an appraisal opinion. Comparables used by appraisers are considered ""worthy"" or able to be used by the appraiser if they were sold within the last 12 months of the appraisal date of the subject property. Some appraiser are allowed sales only witin 6 months of the subject property. This differs with each company that is hired to appraise the subject property.   The above information holds true also when a Professional Licensed Real Estate Agent prepares a CMA ( comparitive market analysis) on the subject property.   When initially preparing a CMA, an agent will search back 12 months from the day of CMA preparation. Keep in mind, that when the subject home agrees to terms between buyer and seller or gets an ""accepted offer"", the lender of the BUYER will order the ""Appraisal"". Some comps that were originally used may not be ""worthy comps"" depending on the date the comparable was sold. Again, comps are worthy witin 12 months of the appraisal date of the subject property.     [ edit ]   The income capitalization approach       Main article:  Income approach       The income capitalization approach  (often referred to simply as the ""income approach"") is used to value commercial and investment properties. Because it is intended to directly reflect or model the expectations and behaviors of typical market participants, this approach is generally considered the most applicable valuation technique for income-producing properties, where sufficient market data exists to supply the necessary inputs and parameters for this approach.   In a commercial income-producing property this approach capitalizes an income stream into a value indication. This can be done using revenue multipliers or  capitalization rates  applied to the first-year Net Operating Income. The Net Operating Income (NOI) is gross potential income (GPI), less vacancy and collection loss (= Effective Gross Income) less operating expenses (but excluding debt service, income taxes, and/or depreciation charges applied by accountants).   Alternatively, multiple years of net operating income can be valued by a  discounted cash flow  analysis (DCF) model. The DCF model is widely used to value larger and more expensive income-producing properties, such as large office towers. This technique applies market-supported yields (or discount rates) to future cash flows (such as annual income figures and typically a lump reversion from the eventual sale of the property) to arrive at a present value indication.     [ edit ]   UK valuation methods   In the UK, valuation methodology has traditionally been classified into five methods:     1.  Comparable method . Used for most types of property where there is good evidence of previous sales. This is analogous to the sales comparison approach outlined above.       2.  Investment/income method . Used for most commercial (and residential) property that is producing future cash flows through the letting of the property. If the current Estimated Rental Value (ERV) and the passing income are known, as well as the market-determined  equivalent yield , then the property value can be determined by means of a simple model. Note that this method is really a comparison method, since the main variables are determined in the market. In standard US practice, however, the closely related capitalising of NOI is confounded with the DCF method under the general classification of the income capitalization approach (see above).       3.  Accounts/profits method . Used for trading properties where evidence of rates is slight, such as hotels, restaurants and old-age homes. A three-year average of operating income (derived from the profit and loss or  income statement ) is capitalised using an appropriate yield. Note that since the variables used are inherent to the property and are not market-derived, therefore unless appropriate adjustments are made, the resulting value will be Value-in-Use or Investment Value, not  Market Value .       4.  Development/residual method . Used for properties ripe for development or redevelopment or for bare land only.       5.  Contractor's/cost method . Used for only those properties not bought and sold on the market. Both the development/residual method and the contractor's/cost method would be grouped in the US under the  cost approach  (see above).       [ edit ]   Further considerations     [ edit ]   Scope of work   While USPAP has always required appraisers to identify the scope of work needed to produce credible results, it became clear in recent years that appraisers did not fully understand the process for developing this adequately. In formulating the scope of work for a credible appraisal, the concept of a  limited  versus  complete  appraisal and the use of the Departure Rule caused confusion to clients, appraisers, and appraisal reviewers. In order to deal with this, USPAP was updated in 2006 with what came to be known as the Scope of Work project. In short, USPAP eliminated the Departure Rule and the concept of a limited appraisal and created a new Scope of Work rule. In this, appraisers were to identify six key parts of the appraisal problem at the beginning of each assignment:     Client and other intended users   Intended use of the appraisal and appraisal report   Definition of value (e.g. -- market, foreclosure, investment)   Any hypothetical conditions or extraordinary assumptions   The effective date of the appraisal analysis   The salient features of the subject property     Based on these factors, the appraiser must identify the scope of work needed, including the methodologies to be used, the extent of investigation, and the applicable approaches to value. The rule provided the explicit requirement that the minimum standards for scope of work were:     Expectations of the client and other users   The actions of the appraiser's peers who carry out similar assignments     The Scope of Work is the first step in any appraisal process. Without a strictly defined Scope of Work an appraisal's conclusions may not be viable. By defining the Scope of Work an appraiser can begin to actually develop a value for a given property for the intended user, which is the intended use of the appraisal.     [ edit ]   Highest and best use       Main article:  Highest and best use       Highest and Best Use  (HABU) is a term of art in the appraisal process. It is a process to determine the use of the property which produces the highest value for the land, as if vacant. There are four steps to the process. First, the appraiser determines all uses which are legally permissible for the property. Second, of the uses which are legally permissible, which ones are physically possible. Of those, which ones are financially feasible (sometimes referred to as  economically supported ). Of those uses which are feasible, which one and only use is maximally productive for the site. In a simple context, the appraiser must do this twice, comparing the results -- as if the land is vacant and in the as-is-improved state, taking into account the costs of demolishing any existing improvements. The outcome of this process is the highest and best use for the site. An appraisal of market value must explicitly assume that the owner or buyer would employ the property in its highest and best use, and therefore value the site accordingly.   In more complex appraisal assignments (e.g. -- contract disputes, litigation, brownfield or contaminated property valuation), the determination of highest and best use may be much more complex, and may need to take into account the various intermediate or temporary uses of the site, the contamination remediation process, and the timing of various legal issues. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Types of ownership interest   Implicit in the analysis of the subject property is a determination of the interest in the property being appraised. For most common situations (e.g. -- mortgage finance) the  fee simple  interest is explicitly assumed since it is the most complete bundle of rights available. However, in many situations, and in many societies which do not follow English Common Law or the Napoleanic Code, some other interest may be more common. While there are many different possible interests in real estate, the three most common are:     Fee simple value  (known in the UK as  freehold ) - The most complete ownership in real estate, subject in common law countries to the powers reserved to the state (taxation, escheat, eminent domain, and police power)       Leased fee value  - This is simply the fee simple interest encumbered by a lease. If the lease is at market rent, then the leased fee value and the fee simple value are equal. However, if the tenant pays more or less than market, the residual owned by the leased fee holder, plus the market value of the tenancy, may be more or less than the fee simple value.       Leasehold value  - The interest held by a tenant. If the tenant pays market rent, then the leasehold has no market value. However, if the tenant pays less than market, the difference betweent the present value of what is paid and the present value of market rents would be a positive leasehold value. For example, a major chain retailer may be able to negotiate a below-market lease to serve as the anchor tenant for a shopping center. This leasehold value may be transferrable to another anchor tenant, and if so the retail tenant has a positive interest in the real estate.       [ edit ]   Mass appraisal and automated valuation models   Automated valuation models  (AVMs) are growing in acceptance. These rely on statistical models such as multiple regression analysis or geographic information systems (GIS). [ 8 ]  While AVMs can be quite accurate, particularly when used in a very homogeneous area, there is also evidence that AVMs are not accurate in other instances such as when they are used in rural areas, or when the appraised property does not conform well to the neighborhood. AVM's have also gained favor in class action litigation, and have been substantiated in numerous cases, both in Federal and state courts, as the appropriate method for dealing with large-scale real estate litigation problems, such as contaminated neighborhoods [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Governing authorities and professional organizations     [ edit ]   International   The various US and international professional organizations have started collaborating in recent years towards the development of  International Valuation Standards  which will facilitate global real estate appraisal, a much-needed adjunct to real estate investment portfolios which transcend national boundaries.   The IVSC - The  International Valuation Standards Committee , is a  Non-governmental Organisation (NGO)  member of the  UN , with membership that encompasses all the major national valuation standard-setters and professional associations from 41 different countries (including the  Appraisal Institute , the  RICS  and the  Appraisal Institute of Canada ). IVSC have published the  International Valuation Standards (IVS) , now in their 8th edition.     [ edit ]   Germany   In  Germany , real estate appraisal is known as real estate valuation ( Immobilienbewertung ). Real estate appraisers ( Immobilienbewerter  or  Gutachter ) can qualify to become a  ffentlich bestellter und vereidigter Sachverstndiger  (officially appointed and sworn expert). However, this formerly very important title has lost a lot of its importance over the past years, but still is of some value in court procedures. The title is not generally required for appraisals.   Governing authorities  The real estate appraisal practice in Germany is partly codified by law. The federal  Baugesetzbuch  (abbr. BauGB, ""German statutory code on building and construction'"") contains guidelines on governing authorities, defines the term market value and refers to continuative rules (chapter 3, articles 192 ff.). Each municipality (city or administrative district) has to form a  Gutachterausschuss  (appraisal committee), consisting of a chairman and honorary members  [ 10 ] . The committee gathers information on all real estate deals (it is mandatory to send a copy of each notarial purchase contract to the  Gutachterausschuss ) and includes it in the  Kaufpreissammlung  (purchase price database). Most committees publish an official real estate market report every two years, in which besides other information on comparables the land value is determined. The committees also perform appraisals on behalf of public authorities.   Federal regulations  The BauGB defines the  Verkehrswert  or  Marktwert  (market value, both terms with identical meaning) as follows: ""The market value is determined by the price that can be realised at the date of valuation, in an arm's length transaction, with due regard to the legal situation and the effective characteristics, the nature and lay of the premises or any other subject of the valuation""  [ 11 ]  (non-official translation). The intention, as in other countries, is to include all objective influences and to exclude all influences resulting from the subjective circumstances of the involved parties.   This federal law is supported by the  Wertermittlungsverordnung  (abbr. WertV, ""regulation on the determination of value"")  [ 12 ] . The WertV defines the codified valuation approaches and the general valuation technique. German codified valuation approaches (other apporaches such as DCF or residual approach are also permitted, but not codified) are the:     Vergleichswertverfahren  (sales comparison approach) - used where good evidence of previous sales is available and for owner-occupied assets, especially condominiums and single-family houses;   Ertragswertverfahren  (German income approach) - standard procedure for property that produces future cash flows from the letting of the property;   Sachwertverfahren  (German cost approach) - used for specialised property where none of the above approaches applies, e. g. public buildings.     WertV's general regulations are further supported by the  Wertermittlungsrichtlinie  (abbr. WertR, ""directive on the determination of value"")  [ 13 ] . The WertR provides templates for calculations, tables (e. g. economic depreciation) and guidelines for the consideration of different influences. WertV and WertR are not binding for appraisals for nonofficial use, nonetheless they should be regarded as  best practice  or Generally Accepted (German) Valuation Practice (GAVP).   Comments on German GAVP  In most regards Generally Accepted (German) Valuation Principles is consistent with international practice. The investment market weighs the income approach most heavily. However, there are some important differences:     Land and improvements are treated separately. German GAVP assumes that the land can be used indefinitely, but the buildings have a limited lifespan; This coincides with the balancing of the assets. The value of the land is determined by the sales comparison approach in both the income and cost approaches, using the data accumulated by the  Gutachterausschuss  which is then added to the building value.   In order to account for the usage of the land, the  net operating income  is reduced by the  Liegenschaftszins  (interest paid to the land-owner by the owner of the building, i.e. ground rent). The  Liegenschaftszins  is the product of the land value and the  Liegenschaftszinssatz  (interest rate for land-use). The  Liegenschaftszinssatz  is the equivalent of the yield - with some important differences - and is also determined by the  Gutachterausschuss .   Unlike the All Risks Yield (ARY) in UK practice, the  Liegenschaftszinssatz  (abbr. LZ) does not include an allowance for default (not to be confused with structural vacancy), therefore this needs to be subtracted from  gross operating income . As a result, the  Liegenschaftszinssatz  will usually be lower than the All Risks Yield.   Based on the assumption that the economic life of the improvements is limited, the yield and remaining economic life determine the building value from the net operating income.   It should also be observed that contracts in Germany generally prescribe that the landlord bears a higher portion of maintenance and operating costs than their counterparts in the US and UK.     Criticism  Mathematically the distinction between land and improvements in the income approach will have no impact on the overall value when the remaining economic life is more than thirty years. For this reason it has become quite common to use the  Vereinfachtes Ertragswertverfahren  (simplified income approach), omitting the land value and the  Liegenschaftszins . However, the separate treatment of land and buildings leads to more precise results for older buildings, especially for commercial buildings, which typically have a shorter economic life than residential buildings.   An advantage of the comparatively high degree of standardization practiced by professional appraisers, is the greater ability to check an appraisal for inconsistency, accuracy and transparency.   Professional organisations  The Federal German Organisation of Appointed and Sworn Experts ( Bundesverband Deutscher Sachverstndiger und Fachgutachter , abbr. BDSF) [ 14 ]  is the main professional organisation encompassing the majority of licensed appraisers in Germany. In recent years, with the move towards a more global outlook in the valuation profession, the  RICS  has gained a foothold in Germany, somewhat at the expense of the BDSF.   With special focus on hypothecary value, in 1996, German banks with real estate financing activities formed the  HypZert GmbH [ 15 ] , an association for the certification of real estate valuers. A  HypZert  qualification is regarded as mandatory for their appraisers by many German banks.     [ edit ]   Israel   In  Israel , the real estate appraisal profession is regulated by the Council of Land Valuers, an organ of the Ministry of Justice; the largest professional organisation, encompassing the majority of appraisers/land valuers is the Association of Land Valuers. Valuers must be registered with the Council, which is a statutory body set up by law, and which oversees the training and administers the national professional exams that are a prerequisite for attaining registration. In 2005 the Council set up a Valuation Standards Committee with the purpose of developing and promulgating Standards that would reflect best practice; these have tended to follow a rules-based approach.   Historically, most valuations in Israel were statutory valuations (such as valuations performed for purposes of  Betterment Tax  - a tax administered on any gains accruing to the property by way of changes to the local planning) as well as valuations performed for purposes of bank lending. This is now changing: since the adoption in Israel of  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  (were adopted in 2006; will fully come into effect in 2008), the profession has been additionally engaged in performing valuations for purposes of financial reporting.     [ edit ]   Japan   The  Japanese Association of Real Estate Appraisal , established in 1965, is the only certified association and is regulated by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transportation and Tourism.     [ edit ]   United Kingdom   In the  UK , real estate appraisal is known as  property valuation  and a real estate appraiser is a  land valuer  or  property valuer  (usually a qualified  chartered surveyor  who specialises in property valuation). Property valuation in the UK is regulated by the  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors  (RICS), a professional body encompassing all of the building and property-related professions. The RICS professional guidelines for valuers are published in the  RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards , commonly known as the  Red Book . While based in the UK, RICS is a global organization and has become very active in the US in recent years through its affiliation with the Counselors of Real Estate, a division of the National Association of Realtors.     [ edit ]   United States   Appraisal practice in the US is regulated by the various states. The  Financial Institutions Reform and Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA)  of 1989 demanded all the states to develop systems for licensing and certifying real estate appraisers. [ 16 ]  To accomplish this, the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) was formed, with representatives from the various Federal mortgage regulatory agencies. [ 17 ]  Thus, currently all the  real estate  appraisers must be state-licensed and certified. But prior to the 1990s, there were no commonly accepted standards either for appraisal quality or for appraiser licensure. In the 1980s, an ad-hoc committee representing various appraisal professional organizations in the U.S. and Canada met to codify the best practices into what became known as the  Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) . The  Savings and Loan Crisis  in the U.S. resulted in increased Federal regulation of the mortgage lending process via the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1991. A portion of this act required federal lending regulators to adopt appraisal standards. A not-for-profit organization, the  Appraisal Foundation  (TAF), was formed by the same organizations which had developed USPAP, and the copyright for USPAP was signed over to TAF. Federal oversight of TAF is provided by the Appraisal Subcommittee, made up of representatives of various Federal lending regulators. TAF carries out its work through two boards: the Appraisal Standards Board promulgates and updates USPAP; the Appraisal Qualifications Board (AQB) promulgates minimum recommended standards for appraiser certification and licensure. During the 1990s, all of the states adopted USPAP as the governing standards within their states and developed licensure standards which met or exceeded the recommendations of TAF. Also, the various state and federal courts have adopted USPAP for real estate litigation and all of the federally lending regulators adopt USPAP for mortgage finance appraisal. [ 17 ]   In addition, there are professional appraisal organizations, organized as private not-for-profits, which date to the  Great Depression  of the 1930s. One of the oldest in the U.S. is the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers (ASFMRA), founded in 1929. [ 18 ]  Others were founded as needed and opportunity arose in specialized fields, such as the Appraisal Institute (AI) and the American Society of Appraisers (ASA) founded in the 1930s, the International Right of Way Association and the National Association of Realtors which were founded after World War II. These organizations all existed to establish and enforce standards, but their influence has waned as the government increases appraisal regulation. In March 2007, three of these organizations (ASFMRA, ASA, and AI) announced an agreement in principle to merge. NAIFA (National Association of Independent Fee Appraisers), a charter member of The Appraisal Foundation, helped to write Title XI, the Real Estate Appraisal Reform Amendments. It was founded in 1961.   The best known professional organization of real estate appraisers in America is the  Appraisal Institute . It was formed in from the merger of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers and the Society of Real Estate Appraisers. Founded along with others in the 1930s, the two organizations merged in the 1990s to form the  Appraisal Institute  (AI). This group awards two professional designations:  SRA , to residential appraisers, and  MAI , to commercial appraisers. The Institute has enacted rigorous regulations regarding to the use and display of these designations. For example, contrary to popular belief, ""MAI"" does  not  stand for ""Member, Appraisal Institute"". According to the institute, the letters ""do not represent specific words"", and an MAI may not use the words ""Member, Appraisal Institute"" in lieu of the MAI mark. The primary motive for this rule is to prevent dilution of the trademark.   Other leading appraisal organizations include the  American Society of Appraisers ,  National Association of Independent Fee Appraisers , and the  National Association of Master Appraisers , which were also founding sponsor-members of the Appraisal Foundation. [ 19 ]  The  Massachusetts Board of Real Estate Appraisers  (MBREA), founded in 1934, is the only state appraisal association that has been named a sponsor of the Appraisal Foundation.  [ 20 ]  In recent years, the  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)  has become highly regarded in the US, and has formed a collaboration with the Counselors of Real Estate, a division of the  National Association of Realtors . RICS, which is headquartered in London, operates on a global scale and awards the designations  MRICS  and  FRICS  to Members and Fellows of RICS. The  Real Estate Counseling Group of America  is a small group of the top appraisers and real estate analysts in the US who collectively have authored a disproportionately large body of appraisal methodology.

In the  common law  systems personal property may also be called  chattels  or  personalty . It is distinguished from  real property , or  real estate . In the  civil law  systems personal property is often called  movable property  or  movables  - any property that can be moved from one location to another. This term is in distinction with  immovable property  or immovables, such as land and buildings.   Historically,  slaves  have often been legally treated as personal property. In some cultures, servants, wives and children have also been considered to greater or lesser degrees to be the personal property ( chattel ) of their husbands, fathers or guardians. For example, in Biblical times, the ancient Hebrews were permitted to sell their daughters into servitude, and servants could be bought or sold as slaves were - although Hebrew servants could not be legally sold to aliens, and male Hebrew servants were set free after serving for 7 years. (see Exodus 20 for details). Even in Victorian times, children could be bought and sold - as chronicled in  Charles Dickens 's novel  Oliver Twist .   Personal property may be classified in a variety of ways.  Tangible personal property  refers to any type of property that can generally be moved (i.e., it is not attached to real property or land), touched or felt. These generally include items such as furniture, clothing, jewelry, art, writings, or household goods. In some cases, there can be formal title documents that show the ownership and transfer rights of that property after a person's death (for example, motor vehicles, boats, etc.) In many cases, however, tangible personal property will not be ""titled"" in an owner's name and is presumed to be whatever property he or she was in possession of at the time of his or her death.   Intangible personal property  or ""intangibles"" refers to personal property that cannot be actually ""moved"" touched or felt, but instead represents something of value such as  negotiable instruments ,  securities ,  goods , and  intangible assets  including  chose in action .   Accountants also distinguish personal property from real property because personal property can be  depreciated  faster than improvements (while land is not depreciable at all). It is an owner's right to get tax benefits for chattel, and there are businesses that specialize in appraising personal property, or chattel.   The distinction between these types of property is significant for a variety of reasons. Usually one's rights on movables are more attenuated than one's rights on immovables (or real property). The  statutes of limitations  or  prescriptive periods  are usually shorter when dealing with personal or movable property. Real property rights are usually enforceable for a much longer period of time and in most jurisdictions real estate and immovables are registered in government-sanctioned land registers. In some jurisdictions, rights (such as a  lien  or other security interest) can be registered against personal or movable property.   In the common law it is possible to place a  mortgage  upon real property. Such mortgage requires payment or the owner of the mortgage can seek  foreclosure . Personal property can often be secured with similar kind of device, variously called a  chattel mortgage , trust receipt, or  security interest . In the United States, Article 9 of the  Uniform Commercial Code  governs the creation and enforcement of security interests in most (but not all) types of personal property.   There is no similar institution to the mortgage in the civil law, however a  hypothec  is a device to secure  real rights  against property. These real rights follow the property along with the ownership. In the common law a lien also remains on the property and it is not extinguished by alienation of the property; liens may be real or  equitable .   Many jurisdictions levy a personal  property tax , an annual tax on the privilege of owning or possessing personal property within the boundaries of the jurisdiction. Automobile and boat registration fees are a subset of this tax. Most household goods are exempt as long as they are kept or used within the household; the tax usually becomes a problem when the taxing authority discovers that expensive personal property like art is being regularly stored outside of the household.     [ edit ]   Personal vs Private property   In political/economic theory, notably  anarchism ,  communism  and some  socialist  philosophies, the distinction between private and personal property is extremely important. They are separated by a blurry boundary, which items of property constitute which is open to debate.     Personal property  is part of your person and includes property from which you have the right to exclude others (e.g TVs, cars, clothes etc). [ 1 ]       Private property  is a  social relationship , not a relationship between person and thing according to  Marx  (e.g factories, mines, dams, infrastructure etc). In  capitalism  there is no distinction between personal and private property. [ 2 ]       To many socialists, the term  private property  refers to capital or the means of production, while personal property refers to consumer and non-capital goods and services.

clueweb09-en0011-44-27922	                                                                                        What is an Appraisal?                                        An appraisal is an opinion of value that can apply to real property, such as land,                     houses, and buildings. A standard residential appraisal does not take personal property                     such as cars, jewelry, boats, etc. into consideration. For lending transactions,                     typically a state licensed or certified real estate appraiser completes the inspection                     report. The appraiser uses information such as the age of the home, number of rooms                     and amenities to determine the market value of the home. The appraiser also takes                     into consideration sales information from similar homes in the area to help in determining                     the value.                                        What is the Market Value?                                        The market value is the major focus of most real estate appraisal assignments. The                     market value can be defined as the most probable price the property should sell                     for in an open and competitive market.                                        What is the appraisal used for?                                        Appraisals can be used in many different circumstances, including when a property                     is sold, taxed, insured and financed, but it is almost always used to attach a value                     to the property. If the subject property is being used as collateral in a loan transaction,                     the lending institution may require an appraisal as an appropriate determination                     of value in order to justify the loan amount being requested.                                        What does the appraiser consider in determining the value of the subject?                                        For most residential valuations the appraiser is required to measure the house from                     the outside to determine square footage. This external measurement is standard throughout                     the industry for full appraisals. Typically no interior measurements are required.                     The appraiser will take notes throughout the inspection concerning the features                     of your house such as room layout, number of bedrooms, baths, etc. The appraiser                     also makes a determination of the general condition, appeal, and functional layout                     of your house. All of these items are taken into consideration in the appraisal                     report. The physical inspection of a typical property usually takes between five                     and fifteen minutes. Sometimes the inspection can take longer if the house is difficult                     to measure or has some unique features that require additional investigation by                     the appraiser. After the initial inspection of the property, the appraiser spends                     time touring through the neighborhood or area. The purpose of this tour is to search                     for other properties that are similar to your property that have sold within the                     last year. The appraiser must correlate sales information in your home's neighborhood                     with the relevant information associated with your home in order to determine market                     value. As such the appraiser cannot provide you with an opinion of value during                     the inspection of your home. When the field work is finished, the appraiser completes                     the report at his office. The report is usually about ten pages long and has taken                     over four hours to complete.                                        Does the appraiser do a whole house inspection?                                        No, an appraiser is not a home inspector, engineer, architect, electrician, plumber,                     H.V.A.C technician or contractor. The appraiser briefly walks through the house                     to get an idea of the general condition and room count, and if looking for obvious                     items, not hidden defects, for example hidden structural, or other concerns. An                     appraisal is never a guarantee of condition.                                        Will I be able to learn the value from the appraiser while he is there?                                        It is common for the owner to ask the appraiser how much the property is worth as                     soon as the inspection is completed. The truth is at this time the appraiser does                     not have enough information available to ethically indicate an opinion of value.                     In fact, it would be a violation of state licensing laws for the appraiser to simply                     indicate a value without completing all the research steps necessary after the inspection.                     When the appraiser completes the physical inspection of the home, his work is just                     beginning. He will then compile data about local market conditions from public record                     and evaluate which sales appear to be the most similar indicators of value in your                     home's marketing area. The appraiser takes all of this information into consideration                     and uses it to come to a reasonable value conclusion of the property. As such, the                     appraiser will have no opinion of value to give you at the time he is at your house.                                        If the appraiser is not from my area, how can he properly value my property?                                        The appraiser assigned to value a property should always be familiar with the specifics                     of an area or neighborhood. A common misconception is that only someone who lives                     close by would know the area. Many appraisers cover multiple counties as they are                     able to maintain comprehensive data on all areas that they appraise. Please remember                     that it is the appraisers job to know the area that he is working in and to do as                     much research as necessary to complete the job correctly.

clueweb09-enwp01-80-15167	"                     Real estate appraisal          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Real estate apraisal )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Real estate appraisal ,  property valuation  or  land valuation  is the practice of developing an opinion of the value of real property, usually its  Market Value . The need for appraisals arises from the heterogeneous nature of property as an investment class: no two properties are identical, and all properties differ from each other in their location - which is the most important determinant of their value. So there cannot exist a centralised  Walrasian auction  setting for the trading of property assets, as there exists for trade in corporate stock. The absence of a market-based pricing mechanism determines the need for an expert appraisal/valuation of real estate/property.   A real estate appraisal is performed by a licensed or certified appraiser (in many countries known as a  property valuer  or  land valuer  and in British English as a ""valuation surveyor""). If the appraiser's opinion is based on Market Value, then it must also be based on the  Highest and Best Use  of the  real property . For mortgage valuations of improved residential property in the US, the appraisal is most often reported on a standardized form, such as the  Uniform Residential Appraisal Report . [ 1 ]  Appraisals of more complex property (e.g. -- income producing, raw land) are usually reported in a narrative appraisal report.

Some of the most common are:     Market Value   The price at which an asset would trade in a competitive  Walrasian auction  setting. Market Value is usually interchangeable with  Open Market Value  or  Fair Value .  International Valuation Standards  (IVS) define Market Value as:           Market Value  is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgably, prudently, and without compulsion. [ 2 ]           Value-in-use   The net present value (NPV) of a cash flow that an asset generates for a specific owner under a specific use. Value-in-use is the value to one particular user, and is usually below the market value of a property.       Investment value  - is the value to one particular investor, and is usually higher than the market value of a property.       Insurable value  - is the value of real property covered by an  insurance policy . Generally it does not include the site value.       Liquidation value  -- may be analyzed as either a  forced liquidation  or an  orderly liquidation  and is a commonly sought standard of value in bankruptcy proceedings. It assumes a seller who is compelled to sell after an exposure period which is less than the market-normal timeframe.       [ edit ]   Price versus value   It is important to distinguish between  Market Value  and  Price . A price obtained for a specific property under a specific transaction may or may not represent that property's market value: special considerations may have been present, such as a special relationship between the buyer and the seller, or else the transaction may have been part of a larger set of transactions in which the parties had engaged. Another possibility is that a special buyer may have been willing to pay a premium over and above the market value, if his subjective valuation of the property (its  investment value  for him) was higher than the Market Value. An example of this would be the owner of a neighbouring property who, by combining his own property with the subject property, could thereby obtain economies-of-scale. Such situations often arise in corporate finance, as for example when a merger or acquisition is concluded at a price which is higher than the value represented by the price of the underlying stock. The usual rationale for these valuations would be that the 'sum is greater than its parts', since full ownership of a company entails special privileges for which a potential purchaser would be willing to pay. Such situations arise in real estate/property markets as well. It is the task of the real estate appraiser/property valuer to judge whether a specific price obtained under a specific transaction is indicative of Market Value.       [ edit ]   Market value definitions in the USA   In the US, appraisals are performed to a certain standard of value (e.g. -- foreclosure value, fair market value, distressed sale value, investment value). The most commonly used definition of value is  Market Value . While  USPAP  does not define Market Value, it provides general guidance for how Market Value should be defined:   a type of value, stated as an opinion, that presumes the transfer or sale of a property as of a certain date, under specific conditions set forth in the definition of the term identified by the appraiser as applicable in an appraisal.   Thus, the definition of value used in an appraisal or CMA analysis and report is a set of assumptions about the market in which the subject property may transact. It becomes the basis for selecting comparable data for use in the analysis. These assumptions will vary from definition to definition but generally fall into three categories:     [ edit ]   Three approaches to value   There are three general groups of methodologies for determining value. These are usually referred to as the ""three approaches to value"":     The  cost approach   The  sales comparison approach  and   The  income approach     However, the recent trend of the business tends to be clining to the scientific methodology of appraisal which lies on the foundation of quantitative-data  [ 3 ] , risk and geographical based approaches  [ 4 ] ,   [ 5 ] . Pagourtzi  et al.  have provided a review on the methods used in the industry by comparison between conventional approaches and advanced ones  [ 6 ] .   The appraiser using three approaches will determine which one or more of these approaches may be applicable, based on the scope of work determination, and from that develop an appraisal analysis. Costs, income, and sales vary widely from one situation to the next, and particular importance is given to the specific characteristics of the subject.   Consideration is also given to the market for the property appraised. Appraisals of properties that are typically purchased by investors (e.g. - skyscrapers) may give greater weight to the income approach, while small retail or office properties, often purchased by owner-users, may give greater weighting to the sales comparison approach. While this may seem simple, it is not always obvious. For example, apartment complexes of a given quality tend to sell at a price per apartment, and as such the sales comparison approach may be more applicable. Single family residences are most commonly valued with greatest weighting to the sales comparison approach, but if a single family dwelling is in a neighborhood where all or most of the dwellings are rental units, then some variant of the income approach may be more useful.     [ edit ]   The cost approach   The  cost approach  was formerly called the summation approach. The theory is that the value of a property can be estimated by summing the land value and the depreciated value of any improvements. The value of the improvements is often referred to by the abbreviation RCNLD (reproduction cost new less depreciation or replacement cost new less depreciation). Reproduction refers to reproducing an exact replica. Replacement cost refers to the cost of building a house or other improvement which has the same utility, but using modern design, workmanship and materials. In practice, appraisers use replacement cost and then deduct a factor for any functional disutility associated with the age of the subject property.   In most instances when the cost approach is involved, the overall methodology is a hybrid of the cost and sales comparison approaches. For example, while the replacement cost to construct a building can be determined by adding the labor, material, and other costs, land values and depreciation must be derived from an analysis of comparable data.   The cost approach is considered reliable when used on newer structures, but the method tends to become less reliable for older properties. The cost approach is often the only reliable approach when dealing with special use properties (e.g. -- public assembly, marinas).     [ edit ]   The sales comparison approach   Template:Comparitive Market Analysis   The  Comparitive Market Analysis (CMA)  examines the price or price per unit/SF area of similar properties being sold in the marketplace. * Similar properties are of similar square footage, number of levels, age of the home, condition of the home, and area proximity of the subject home. Simply put, the sales of properties similar to the subject are analyzed and the sale prices adjusted to account for differences in the comparables to the subject to determine the value of the subject. This approach is generally considered the most reliable if adequate comparable sales exist. In any event, it is the only independent check on the reasonability of an appraisal opinion. Comparables used by appraisers are considered ""worthy"" or able to be used by the appraiser if they were sold within the last 12 months of the appraisal date of the subject property. Some appraiser are allowed sales only witin 6 months of the subject property. This differs with each company that is hired to appraise the subject property.   The above information holds true also when a Professional Licensed Real Estate Agent prepares a CMA ( comparitive market analysis) on the subject property.   When initially preparing a CMA, an agent will search back 12 months from the day of CMA preparation. Keep in mind, that when the subject home agrees to terms between buyer and seller or gets an ""accepted offer"", the lender of the BUYER will order the ""Appraisal"". Some comps that were originally used may not be ""worthy comps"" depending on the date the comparable was sold. Again, comps are worthy witin 12 months of the appraisal date of the subject property...........     [ edit ]   The income capitalization approach   Main article:  Income approach   The income capitalization approach  (often referred to simply as the ""income approach"") is used to value commercial and investment properties. Because it is intended to directly reflect or model the expectations and behaviors of typical market participants, this approach is generally considered the most applicable valuation technique for income-producing properties, where sufficient market data exists to supply the necessary inputs and parameters for this approach.   In a commercial income-producing property this approach capitalizes an income stream into a value indication. This can be done using revenue multipliers or  capitalization rates  applied to the first-year Net Operating Income. The Net Operating Income (NOI) is gross potential income (GPI), less vacancy and collection loss (= Effective Gross Income) less operating expenses (but excluding debt service, income taxes, and/or depreciation charges applied by accountants).   Alternatively, multiple years of net operating income can be valued by a  discounted cash flow  analysis (DCF) model. The DCF model is widely used to value larger and more expensive income-producing properties, such as large office towers. This technique applies market-supported yields (or discount rates) to future cash flows (such as annual income figures and typically a lump reversion from the eventual sale of the property) to arrive at a present value indication.     [ edit ]   UK valuation methods   In the UK, valuation methodology has traditionally been classified into five methods:     1.  Comparable method . Used for most types of property where there is good evidence of previous sales. This is analogous to the sales comparison approach outlined above.       2.  Investment/income method . Used for most commercial (and residential) property that is producing future cash flows through the letting of the property. If the current Estimated Rental Value (ERV) and the passing income are known, as well as the market-determined  equivalent yield , then the property value can be determined by means of a simple model. Note that this method is really a comparison method, since the main variables are determined in the market. In standard US practice, however, the closely related capitalising of NOI is confounded with the DCF method under the general classification of the income capitalization approach (see above).       3.  Accounts/profits method . Used for trading properties where evidence of rates is slight, such as hotels, restaurants and old-age homes. A three-year average of operating income (derived from the profit and loss or  income statement ) is capitalised using an appropriate yield. Note that since the variables used are inherent to the property and are not market-derived, therefore unless appropriate adjustments are made, the resulting value will be Value-in-Use or Investment Value, not  Market Value .       4.  Development/residual method . Used for properties ripe for development or redevelopment or for bare land only.       5.  Contractor's/cost method . Used for only those properties not bought and sold on the market. Both the development/residual method and the contractor's/cost method would be grouped in the US under the  cost approach  (see above).       [ edit ]   Further considerations     [ edit ]   Scope of work   While USPAP has always required appraisers to identify the scope of work needed to produce credible results, it became clear in recent years that appraisers did not fully understand the process for developing this adequately. In formulating the scope of work for a credible appraisal, the concept of a  limited  versus  complete  appraisal and the use of the Departure Rule caused confusion to clients, appraisers, and appraisal reviewers. In order to deal with this, USPAP was updated in 2006 with what came to be known as the Scope of Work project. In short, USPAP eliminated the Departure Rule and the concept of a limited appraisal and created a new Scope of Work rule. In this, appraisers were to identify six key parts of the appraisal problem at the beginning of each assignment:     Client and other intended users   Intended use of the appraisal and appraisal report   Definition of value (e.g. -- market, foreclosure, investment)   Any hypothetical conditions or extraordinary assumptions   The effective date of the appraisal analysis   The salient features of the subject property     Based on these factors, the appraiser must identify the scope of work needed, including the methodologies to be used, the extent of investigation, and the applicable approaches to value. The rule provided the explicit requirement that the minimum standards for scope of work were:     Expectations of the client and other users   The actions of the appraiser's peers who carry out similar assignments     The Scope of Work is the first step in any appraisal process. Without a strictly defined Scope of Work an appraisal's conclusions may not be viable. By defining the Scope of Work an appraiser can begin to actually develop a value for a given property for the intended user, which is the intended use of the appraisal.     [ edit ]   Highest and best use   Main article:  Highest and best use   Highest and Best Use  (HABU) is a term of art in the appraisal process. It is a process to determine the use of the property which produces the highest value for the land, as if vacant. There are four steps to the process. First, the appraiser determines all uses which are legally permissible for the property. Second, of the uses which are legally permissible, which ones are physically possible. Of those, which ones are financially feasible (sometimes referred to as  economically supported ). Of those uses which are feasible, which one and only use is maximally productive for the site. In a simple context, the appraiser must do this twice, comparing the results -- as if the land is vacant and in the as-is-improved state, taking into account the costs of demolishing any existing improvements. The outcome of this process is the highest and best use for the site. An appraisal of market value must explicitly assume that the owner or buyer would employ the property in its highest and best use, and therefore value the site accordingly.   In more complex appraisal assignments (e.g. -- contract disputes, litigation, brownfield or contaminated property valuation), the determination of highest and best use may be much more complex, and may need to take into account the various intermediate or temporary uses of the site, the contamination remediation process, and the timing of various legal issues. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Types of ownership interest   Implicit in the analysis of the subject property is a determination of the interest in the property being appraised. For most common situations (e.g. -- mortgage finance) the  fee simple  interest is explicitly assumed since it is the most complete bundle of rights available. However, in many situations, and in many societies which do not follow English Common Law or the Napoleanic Code, some other interest may be more common. While there are many different possible interests in real estate, the three most common are:     Fee simple value  (known in the UK as  freehold ) - The most complete ownership in real estate, subject in common law countries to the powers reserved to the state (taxation, escheat, eminent domain, and police power)       Leased fee value  - This is simply the fee simple interest encumbered by a lease. If the lease is at market rent, then the leased fee value and the fee simple value are equal. However, if the tenant pays more or less than market, the residual owned by the leased fee holder, plus the market value of the tenancy, may be more or less than the fee simple value.       Leasehold value  - The interest held by a tenant. If the tenant pays market rent, then the leasehold has no market value. However, if the tenant pays less than market, the difference betweent the present value of what is paid and the present value of market rents would be a positive leasehold value. For example, a major chain retailer may be able to negotiate a below-market lease to serve as the anchor tenant for a shopping center. This leasehold value may be transferrable to another anchor tenant, and if so the retail tenant has a positive interest in the real estate.       [ edit ]   Mass appraisal and automated valuation models   Automated valuation models  (AVMs) are growing in acceptance. These rely on statistical models such as multiple regression analysis or geographic information systems (GIS). [ 8 ]  While AVMs can be quite accurate, particularly when used in a very homogeneous area, there is also evidence that AVMs are not accurate in other instances such as when they are used in rural areas, or when the appraised property does not conform well to the neighborhood. AVM's have also gained favor in class action litigation, and have been substantiated in numerous cases, both in Federal and state courts, as the appropriate method for dealing with large-scale real estate litigation problems, such as contaminated neighborhoods [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Governing authorities and professional organizations     [ edit ]   International   The various US and international professional organizations have started collaborating in recent years towards the development of  International Valuation Standards  which will facilitate global real estate appraisal, a much-needed adjunct to real estate investment portfolios which transcend national boundaries.   The IVSC - The  International Valuation Standards Committee , is a  Non-governmental Organisation (NGO)  member of the  UN , with membership that encompasses all the major national valuation standard-setters and professional associations from 41 different countries (including the  Appraisal Institute , the  RICS  and the  Appraisal Institute of Canada ). IVSC have published the  International Valuation Standards (IVS) , now in their 8th edition.     [ edit ]   Germany   In  Germany , real estate appraisal is known as real estate valuation ( Immobilienbewertung ). Real estate appraisers ( Immobilienbewerter  or  Gutachter ) can qualify to become a  ffentlich bestellter und vereidigter Sachverstndiger  (officially appointed and sworn expert). However, this formerly very important title has lost a lot of its importance over the past years, but still is of some value in court procedures. The title is not generally required for appraisals.   Governing authorities  The real estate appraisal practice in Germany is partly codified by law. The federal  Baugesetzbuch  (abbr. BauGB, ""German statutory code on building and construction'"") contains guidelines on governing authorities, defines the term market value and refers to continuative rules (chapter 3, articles 192 ff.). Each municipality (city or administrative district) has to form a  Gutachterausschuss  (appraisal committee), consisting of a chairman and honorary members  [ 10 ] . The committee gathers information on all real estate deals (it is mandatory to send a copy of each notarial purchase contract to the  Gutachterausschuss ) and includes it in the  Kaufpreissammlung  (purchase price database). Most committees publish an official real estate market report every two years, in which besides other information on comparables the land value is determined. The committees also perform appraisals on behalf of public authorities.   Federal regulations  The BauGB defines the  Verkehrswert  or  Marktwert  (market value, both terms with identical meaning) as follows: ""The market value is determined by the price that can be realised at the date of valuation, in an arm's length transaction, with due regard to the legal situation and the effective characteristics, the nature and lay of the premises or any other subject of the valuation""  [ 11 ]  (non-official translation). The intention, as in other countries, is to include all objective influences and to exclude all influences resulting from the subjective circumstances of the involved parties.   This federal law is supported by the  Wertermittlungsverordnung  (abbr. WertV, ""regulation on the determination of value"")  [ 12 ] . The WertV defines the codified valuation approaches and the general valuation technique. German codified valuation approaches (other apporaches such as DCF or residual approach are also permitted, but not codified) are the:     Vergleichswertverfahren  (sales comparison approach) - used where good evidence of previous sales is available and for owner-occupied assets, especially condominiums and single-family houses;   Ertragswertverfahren  (German income approach) - standard procedure for property that produces future cash flows from the letting of the property;   Sachwertverfahren  (German cost approach) - used for specialised property where none of the above approaches applies, e. g. public buildings.     WertV's general regulations are further supported by the  Wertermittlungsrichtlinie  (abbr. WertR, ""directive on the determination of value"")  [ 13 ] . The WertR provides templates for calculations, tables (e. g. economic depreciation) and guidelines for the consideration of different influences. WertV and WertR are not binding for appraisals for nonofficial use, nonetheless they should be regarded as  best practice  or Generally Accepted (German) Valuation Practice (GAVP).   Comments on German GAVP  In most regards Generally Accepted (German) Valuation Principles is consistent with international practice. The investment market weighs the income approach most heavily. However, there are some important differences:     Land and improvements are treated separately. German GAVP assumes that the land can be used indefinitely, but the buildings have a limited lifespan; This coincides with the balancing of the assets. The value of the land is determined by the sales comparison approach in both the income and cost approaches, using the data accumulated by the  Gutachterausschuss  which is then added to the building value.   In order to account for the usage of the land, the  net operating income  is reduced by the  Liegenschaftszins  (interest paid to the land-owner by the owner of the building, i.e. ground rent). The  Liegenschaftszins  is the product of the land value and the  Liegenschaftszinssatz  (interest rate for land-use). The  Liegenschaftszinssatz  is the equivalent of the yield - with some important differences - and is also determined by the  Gutachterausschuss .   Unlike the All Risks Yield (ARY) in UK practice, the  Liegenschaftszinssatz  (abbr. LZ) does not include an allowance for default (not to be confused with structural vacancy), therefore this needs to be subtracted from  gross operating income . As a result, the  Liegenschaftszinssatz  will usually be lower than the All Risks Yield.   Based on the assumption that the economic life of the improvements is limited, the yield and remaining economic life determine the building value from the net operating income.   It should also be observed that contracts in Germany generally prescribe that the landlord bears a higher portion of maintenance and operating costs than their counterparts in the US and UK.     Criticism  Mathematically the distinction between land and improvements in the income approach will have no impact on the overall value when the remaining economic life is more than thirty years. For this reason it has become quite common to use the  Vereinfachtes Ertragswertverfahren  (simplified income approach), omitting the land value and the  Liegenschaftszins . However, the separate treatment of land and buildings leads to more precise results for older buildings, especially for commercial buildings, which typically have a shorter economic life than residential buildings.   An advantage of the comparatively high degree of standardization practiced by professional appraisers, is the greater ability to check an appraisal for inconsistency, accuracy and transparency.   Professional organisations  The Federal German Organisation of Appointed and Sworn Experts ( Bundesverband Deutscher Sachverstndiger und Fachgutachter , abbr. BDSF) [ 14 ]  is the main professional organisation encompassing the majority of licensed appraisers in Germany. In recent years, with the move towards a more global outlook in the valuation profession, the  RICS  has gained a foothold in Germany, somewhat at the expense of the BDSF.   With special focus on hypothecary value, in 1996, German banks with real estate financing activities formed the  HypZert GmbH [ 15 ] , an association for the certification of real estate valuers. A  HypZert  qualification is regarded as mandatory for their appraisers by many German banks.     [ edit ]   Israel   In  Israel , the real estate appraisal profession is regulated by the Council of Land Valuers, an organ of the Ministry of Justice; the largest professional organisation, encompassing the majority of appraisers/land valuers is the Association of Land Valuers. Valuers must be registered with the Council, which is a statutory body set up by law, and which oversees the training and administers the national professional exams that are a prerequisite for attaining registration. In 2005 the Council set up a Valuation Standards Committee with the purpose of developing and promulgating Standards that would reflect best practice; these have tended to follow a rules-based approach.   Historically, most valuations in Israel were statutory valuations (such as valuations performed for purposes of  Betterment Tax  - a tax administered on any gains accruing to the property by way of changes to the local planning) as well as valuations performed for purposes of bank lending. This is now changing: since the adoption in Israel of  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  (were adopted in 2006; will fully come into effect in 2008), the profession has been additionally engaged in performing valuations for purposes of financial reporting.     [ edit ]   Japan   The  Japanese Association of Real Estate Appraisal , established in 1965, is the only certified association and is regulated by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transportation and Tourism.     [ edit ]   United Kingdom   In the  UK , real estate appraisal is known as  property valuation  and a real estate appraiser is a  land valuer  or  property valuer  (usually a qualified  chartered surveyor  who specialises in property valuation). Property valuation in the UK is regulated by the  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors  (RICS), a professional body encompassing all of the building and property-related professions. The RICS professional guidelines for valuers are published in the  RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards , commonly known as the  Red Book . While based in the UK, RICS is a global organization and has become very active in the US in recent years through its affiliation with the Counselors of Real Estate, a division of the National Association of Realtors.     [ edit ]   United States   Appraisal practice in the US is regulated by the various states. The  Financial Institutions Reform and Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA)  of 1989 demanded all the states to develop systems for licensing and certifying real estate appraisers. [ 16 ]  To accomplish this, the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) was formed, with representatives from the various Federal mortgage regulatory agencies. [ 17 ]  Thus, currently all the  real estate  appraisers must be state-licensed and certified. But prior to the 1990s, there were no commonly accepted standards either for appraisal quality or for appraiser licensure. In the 1980s, an ad-hoc committee representing various appraisal professional organizations in the U.S. and Canada met to codify the best practices into what became known as the  Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) . The  Savings and Loan Crisis  in the U.S. resulted in increased Federal regulation of the mortgage lending process via the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1991. A portion of this act required federal lending regulators to adopt appraisal standards. A not-for-profit organization, the  Appraisal Foundation  (TAF), was formed by the same organizations which had developed USPAP, and the copyright for USPAP was signed over to TAF. Federal oversight of TAF is provided by the Appraisal Subcommittee, made up of representatives of various Federal lending regulators. TAF carries out its work through two boards: the Appraisal Standards Board promulgates and updates USPAP; the Appraisal Qualifications Board (AQB) promulgates minimum recommended standards for appraiser certification and licensure. During the 1990s, all of the states adopted USPAP as the governing standards within their states and developed licensure standards which met or exceeded the recommendations of TAF. Also, the various state and federal courts have adopted USPAP for real estate litigation and all of the federally lending regulators adopt USPAP for mortgage finance appraisal. [ 17 ]   In addition, there are professional appraisal organizations, organized as private not-for-profits, which date to the  Great Depression  of the 1930s. One of the oldest in the U.S. is the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers (ASFMRA), founded in 1929. [ 18 ]  Others were founded as needed and opportunity arose in specialized fields, such as the Appraisal Institute (AI) and the American Society of Appraisers (ASA) founded in the 1930s, the International Right of Way Association and the National Association of Realtors which were founded after World War II. These organizations all existed to establish and enforce standards, but their influence has waned as the government increases appraisal regulation. In March 2007, three of these organizations (ASFMRA, ASA, and AI) announced an agreement in principle to merge. NAIFA (National Association of Independent Fee Appraisers), a charter member of The Appraisal Foundation, helped to write Title XI, the Real Estate Appraisal Reform Amendments. It was founded in 1961.   The best known professional organization of real estate appraisers in America is the  Appraisal Institute . It was formed in from the merger of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers and the Society of Real Estate Appraisers. Founded along with others in the 1930s, the two organizations merged in the 1990s to form the  Appraisal Institute  (AI). This group awards two professional designations:  SRA , to residential appraisers, and  MAI , to commercial appraisers. The Institute has enacted rigorous regulations regarding to the use and display of these designations. For example, contrary to popular belief, ""MAI"" does  not  stand for ""Member, Appraisal Institute"". According to the institute, the letters ""do not represent specific words"", and an MAI may not use the words ""Member, Appraisal Institute"" in lieu of the MAI mark. The primary motive for this rule is to prevent dilution of the trademark.   Other leading appraisal organizations include the  American Society of Appraisers ,  National Association of Independent Fee Appraisers , and the  National Association of Master Appraisers , which were also founding sponsor-members of the Appraisal Foundation. [ 19 ]  The  Massachusetts Board of Real Estate Appraisers  (MBREA), founded in 1934, is the only state appraisal association that has been named a sponsor of the Appraisal Foundation.  [ 20 ]  In recent years, the  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)  has become highly regarded in the US, and has formed a collaboration with the Counselors of Real Estate, a division of the  National Association of Realtors . RICS, which is headquartered in London, operates on a global scale and awards the designations  MRICS  and  FRICS  to Members and Fellows of RICS. The  Real Estate Counseling Group of America  is a small group of the top appraisers and real estate analysts in the US who collectively have authored a disproportionately large body of appraisal methodology.

In the  common law  systems personal property may also be called  chattels  or  personalty . It is distinguished from  real property , or  real estate . In the  civil law  systems personal property is often called  movable property  or  movables  - any property that can be moved from one location to another. This term is in distinction with  immovable property  or immovables, such as land and buildings.   Historically,  slaves  have often been legally treated as personal property. In some cultures, servants, wives and children have also been considered to greater or lesser degrees to be the personal property ( chattel ) of their husbands, fathers or guardians. For example, in Biblical times, the ancient Hebrews were permitted to sell their daughters into servitude, and servants could be bought or sold as slaves were - although Hebrew servants could not be legally sold to aliens, and male Hebrew servants were set free after serving for 7 years. (see Exodus 20 for details). Even in Victorian times, children could be bought and sold - as chronicled in  Charles Dickens 's novel  Oliver Twist .   Personal property may be classified in a variety of ways.  Tangible personal property  refers to any type of property that can generally be moved (i.e., it is not attached to real property or land), touched or felt. These generally include items such as furniture, clothing, jewelry, art, writings, or household goods. In some cases, there can be formal title documents that show the ownership and transfer rights of that property after a person's death (for example, motor vehicles, boats, etc.) In many cases, however, tangible personal property will not be ""titled"" in an owner's name and is presumed to be whatever property he or she was in possession of at the time of his or her death.   Intangible personal property  or ""intangibles"" refers to personal property that cannot be actually ""moved"" touched or felt, but instead represents something of value such as  negotiable instruments ,  securities ,  goods , and  intangible assets  including  chose in action .   Accountants also distinguish personal property from real property because personal property can be  depreciated  faster than improvements (while land is not depreciable at all). It is an owner's right to get tax benefits for chattel, and there are businesses that specialize in appraising personal property, or chattel.   The distinction between these types of property is significant for a variety of reasons. Usually one's rights on movables are more attenuated than one's rights on immovables (or real property). The  statutes of limitations  or  prescriptive periods  are usually shorter when dealing with personal or movable property. Real property rights are usually enforceable for a much longer period of time and in most jurisdictions real estate and immovables are registered in government-sanctioned land registers. In some jurisdictions, rights (such as a  lien  or other security interest) can be registered against personal or movable property.   In the common law it is possible to place a  mortgage  upon real property. Such mortgage requires payment or the owner of the mortgage can seek  foreclosure . Personal property can often be secured with similar kind of device, variously called a  chattel mortgage , trust receipt, or  security interest . In the United States, Article 9 of the  Uniform Commercial Code  governs the creation and enforcement of security interests in most (but not all) types of personal property.   There is no similar institution to the mortgage in the civil law, however a  hypothec  is a device to secure  real rights  against property. These real rights follow the property along with the ownership. In the common law a lien also remains on the property and it is not extinguished by alienation of the property; liens may be real or  equitable .   Many jurisdictions levy a personal  property tax , an annual tax on the privilege of owning or possessing personal property within the boundaries of the jurisdiction. Automobile and boat registration fees are a subset of this tax. Most household goods are exempt as long as they are kept or used within the household; the tax usually becomes a problem when the taxing authority discovers that expensive personal property like art is being regularly stored outside of the household.     [ edit ]   Personal vs Private property   In political/economic theory, notably  anarchism ,  communism  and some  socialist  philosophies, the distinction between private and personal property is extremely important.

In the  common law  systems personal property may also be called  chattels  or  personalty . It is distinguished from  real property , or  real estate . In the  civil law  systems personal property is often called  movable property  or  movables  - any property that can be moved from one location to another. This term is in distinction with  immovable property  or immovables, such as land and buildings.   Historically,  slaves  have often been legally treated as personal property. In some cultures, servants, wives and children have also been considered to greater or lesser degrees to be the personal property ( chattel ) of their husbands, fathers or guardians. For example, in Biblical times, the ancient Hebrews were permitted to sell their daughters into servitude, and servants could be bought or sold as slaves were - although Hebrew servants could not be legally sold to aliens, and male Hebrew servants were set free after serving for 7 years. (see Exodus 20 for details). Even in Victorian times, children could be bought and sold - as chronicled in  Charles Dickens 's novel  Oliver Twist .   Personal property may be classified in a variety of ways.  Tangible personal property  refers to any type of property that can generally be moved (i.e., it is not attached to real property or land), touched or felt. These generally include items such as furniture, clothing, jewelry, art, writings, or household goods. In some cases, there can be formal title documents that show the ownership and transfer rights of that property after a person's death (for example, motor vehicles, boats, etc.) In many cases, however, tangible personal property will not be ""titled"" in an owner's name and is presumed to be whatever property he or she was in possession of at the time of his or her death.   Intangible personal property  or ""intangibles"" refers to personal property that cannot be actually ""moved"" touched or felt, but instead represents something of value such as  negotiable instruments ,  securities ,  goods , and  intangible assets  including  chose in action .   Accountants also distinguish personal property from real property because personal property can be  depreciated  faster than improvements (while land is not depreciable at all). It is an owner's right to get tax benefits for chattel, and there are businesses that specialize in appraising personal property, or chattel.   The distinction between these types of property is significant for a variety of reasons. Usually one's rights on movables are more attenuated than one's rights on immovables (or real property). The  statutes of limitations  or  prescriptive periods  are usually shorter when dealing with personal or movable property. Real property rights are usually enforceable for a much longer period of time and in most jurisdictions real estate and immovables are registered in government-sanctioned land registers. In some jurisdictions, rights (such as a  lien  or other security interest) can be registered against personal or movable property.   In the common law it is possible to place a  mortgage  upon real property. Such mortgage requires payment or the owner of the mortgage can seek  foreclosure . Personal property can often be secured with similar kind of device, variously called a  chattel mortgage , trust receipt, or  security interest . In the United States, Article 9 of the  Uniform Commercial Code  governs the creation and enforcement of security interests in most (but not all) types of personal property.   There is no similar institution to the mortgage in the civil law, however a  hypothec  is a device to secure  real rights  against property. These real rights follow the property along with the ownership. In the common law a lien also remains on the property and it is not extinguished by alienation of the property; liens may be real or  equitable .   Many jurisdictions levy a personal  property tax , an annual tax on the privilege of owning or possessing personal property within the boundaries of the jurisdiction. Automobile and boat registration fees are a subset of this tax. Most household goods are exempt as long as they are kept or used within the household; the tax usually becomes a problem when the taxing authority discovers that expensive personal property like art is being regularly stored outside of the household.     [ edit ]   Personal vs Private property   In political/economic theory, notably  anarchism ,  communism  and some  socialist  philosophies, the distinction between private and personal property is extremely important. They are separated by a blurry boundary, which items of property constitute which is open to debate.     Personal property  is part of your person and includes property from which you have the right to exclude others (e.g TVs, cars, clothes etc). [ 1 ]       Private property  is a  social relationship , not a relationship between person and thing according to  Marx  (e.g factories, mines, dams, infrastructure etc). In  capitalism  there is no distinction between personal and private property. [ 2 ]       To many socialists, the term  private property  refers to capital or the means of production, while personal property refers to consumer and non-capital goods and services.

In the  common law  systems personal property may also be called  chattels  or  personalty . It is distinguished from  real property , or  real estate . In the  civil law  systems personal property is often called  movable property  or  movables  - any property that can be moved from one location to another. This term is in distinction with  immovable property  or immovables, such as land and buildings.   Historically,  slaves  have often been legally treated as personal property. In some cultures, servants, wives and children have also been considered to greater or lesser degrees to be the personal property ( chattel ) of their husbands, fathers or guardians. For example, in Biblical times, the ancient Hebrews were permitted to sell their daughters into servitude, and servants could be bought or sold as slaves were - although Hebrew servants could not be legally sold to aliens, and male Hebrew servants were set free after serving for 7 years. (see Exodus 20 for details). Even in Victorian times, children could be bought and sold - as chronicled in  Charles Dickens 's novel  Oliver Twist .   Personal property may be classified in a variety of ways.  Tangible personal property  refers to any type of property that can generally be moved (i.e., it is not attached to real property or land), touched or felt. These generally include items such as furniture, clothing, jewelry, art, writings, or household goods. In some cases, there can be formal title documents that show the ownership and transfer rights of that property after a person's death (for example, motor vehicles, boats, etc.) In many cases, however, tangible personal property will not be ""titled"" in an owner's name and is presumed to be whatever property he or she was in possession of at the time of his or her death.   Intangible personal property  or ""intangibles"" refers to personal property that cannot be actually ""moved"" touched or felt, but instead represents something of value such as  negotiable instruments ,  securities ,  goods , and  intangible assets  including  chose in action .   Accountants also distinguish personal property from real property because personal property can be  depreciated  faster than improvements (while land is not depreciable at all). It is an owner's right to get tax benefits for chattel, and there are businesses that specialize in appraising personal property, or chattel.   The distinction between these types of property is significant for a variety of reasons. Usually one's rights on movables are more attenuated than one's rights on immovables (or real property). The  statutes of limitations  or  prescriptive periods  are usually shorter when dealing with personal or movable property. Real property rights are usually enforceable for a much longer period of time and in most jurisdictions real estate and immovables are registered in government-sanctioned land registers. In some jurisdictions, rights (such as a  lien  or other security interest) can be registered against personal or movable property.   In the common law it is possible to place a  mortgage  upon real property. Such mortgage requires payment or the owner of the mortgage can seek  foreclosure . Personal property can often be secured with similar kind of device, variously called a  chattel mortgage , trust receipt, or  security interest . In the United States, Article 9 of the  Uniform Commercial Code  governs the creation and enforcement of security interests in most (but not all) types of personal property.   There is no similar institution to the mortgage in the civil law, however a  hypothec  is a device to secure  real rights  against property. These real rights follow the property along with the ownership. In the common law a lien also remains on the property and it is not extinguished by alienation of the property; liens may be real or  equitable .   Many jurisdictions levy a personal  property tax , an annual tax on the privilege of owning or possessing personal property within the boundaries of the jurisdiction. Automobile and boat registration fees are a subset of this tax. Most household goods are exempt as long as they are kept or used within the household; the tax usually becomes a problem when the taxing authority discovers that expensive personal property like art is being regularly stored outside of the household.     [ edit ]   Personal vs Private property   In political/economic theory, notably  anarchism ,  communism  and some  socialist  philosophies, the distinction between private and personal property is extremely important. They are separated by a blurry boundary, which items of property constitute which is open to debate.     Personal property  is part of your person and includes property from which you have the right to exclude others (e.g TVs, cars, clothes etc). [ 1 ]       Private property  is a  social relationship , not a relationship between person and thing according to  Marx  (e.g factories, mines, dams, infrastructure etc). In  capitalism  there is no distinction between personal and private property. [ 2 ]       To many socialists, the term  private property  refers to capital or the means of production, while personal property refers to consumer and non-capital goods and services.

Business personal property tax, unlike               that of vehicles, is NOT pro-rated.               The property is assessed at various percentages of the total capitalized               cost, depending on the year of acquisition. All such property must               be reported annually, including that which has been expensed or               fully depreciated, and items that once were (or still are) used               for personal use while still available to business use.               Unlike the business license process, payments for the business               tangible personal property tax  do not  need               to accompany the return. Tax bills are mailed by the Treasurer’s               Office after the return is processed by the Commissioner’s               Office, and are due to be paid on or before June 5 to avoid 10%               late payment penalties and interest (10% per year, accrued monthly).

Include a note on the “Total” line                               that these assets are included there.                                                                                                                          What if I am a sole                           proprietor and I own the equipment personally?                                                 You                               must still report any tangible equipment that is used                             or available for use in your business.                                                                                                                          What if I own no                           equipment?                                                 Then you must write “None” on                               the return and still send it in, along with an                         explanation of owning no equipment. You are required                         to file the return no matter how much equipment you have.                         If you lease equipment, then report it in Section Three                         of the return. You may be asked to provide a                             copy of the lease agreement.                                                                                                                         Do you allow for                           technological obsolescence?                                                Yes, for certain                               computer equipment and peripherals, as described                         in Section Two of the return. Computers and peripherals                               are assessed using a more progressive schedule                         of assessment factors, found in Section Two. Please note                         that “computerized” equipment                               is not the same as a computer or peripheral and                         would usually be reported along with all other equipment                               (in Section One),  not  with computer equipment in                             Section Two.                                                                                                                         What if I do not                           depreciate anything?                                                 You must still file the                               form and report all equipment used or available for use                               in the business. You must include an itemized list of                               all equipment; and you may be asked to provide a copy                               of your federal Schedule C or Form 1120 in lieu of the                             required copy of your federal depreciation schedule.

clueweb09-enwp01-53-08539	"                     Real estate appraisal          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Property appraisal )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Real estate appraisal ,  property valuation  or  land valuation  is the practice of developing an opinion of the value of real property, usually its  Market Value . The need for appraisals arises from the heterogeneous nature of property as an investment class: no two properties are identical, and all properties differ from each other in their location - which is the most important determinant of their value. So there cannot exist a centralised  Walrasian auction  setting for the trading of property assets, as there exists for trade in corporate stock. The absence of a market-based pricing mechanism determines the need for an expert appraisal/valuation of real estate/property.   A real estate appraisal is performed by a licensed or certified appraiser (in many countries known as a  property valuer  or  land valuer  and in British English as a ""valuation surveyor""). If the appraiser's opinion is based on Market Value, then it must also be based on the  Highest and Best Use  of the  real property . For mortgage valuations of improved residential property in the US, the appraisal is most often reported on a standardized form, such as the  Uniform Residential Appraisal Report . [ 1 ]  Appraisals of more complex property (e.g. -- income producing, raw land) are usually reported in a narrative appraisal report.

Some of the most common are:     Market Value   The price at which an asset would trade in a competitive  Walrasian auction  setting. Market Value is usually interchangeable with  Open Market Value  or  Fair Value .  International Valuation Standards  (IVS) define Market Value as:           Market Value  is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgably, prudently, and without compulsion. [ 2 ]           Value-in-use   The net present value (NPV) of a cash flow that an asset generates for a specific owner under a specific use. Value-in-use is the value to one particular user, and is usually below the market value of a property.       Investment value  - is the value to one particular investor, and is usually higher than the market value of a property.       Insurable value  - is the value of real property covered by an  insurance policy . Generally it does not include the site value.       Liquidation value  -- may be analyzed as either a  forced liquidation  or an  orderly liquidation  and is a commonly sought standard of value in bankruptcy proceedings. It assumes a seller who is compelled to sell after an exposure period which is less than the market-normal timeframe.       [ edit ]   Price versus value   It is important to distinguish between  Market Value  and  Price . A price obtained for a specific property under a specific transaction may or may not represent that property's market value: special considerations may have been present, such as a special relationship between the buyer and the seller, or else the transaction may have been part of a larger set of transactions in which the parties had engaged. Another possibility is that a special buyer may have been willing to pay a premium over and above the market value, if his subjective valuation of the property (its  investment value  for him) was higher than the Market Value. An example of this would be the owner of a neighbouring property who, by combining his own property with the subject property, could thereby obtain economies-of-scale. Such situations often arise in corporate finance, as for example when a merger or acquisition is concluded at a price which is higher than the value represented by the price of the underlying stock. The usual rationale for these valuations would be that the 'sum is greater than its parts', since full ownership of a company entails special privileges for which a potential purchaser would be willing to pay. Such situations arise in real estate/property markets as well. It is the task of the real estate appraiser/property valuer to judge whether a specific price obtained under a specific transaction is indicative of Market Value.       [ edit ]   Market value definitions in the USA   In the US, appraisals are performed to a certain standard of value (e.g. -- foreclosure value, fair market value, distressed sale value, investment value). The most commonly used definition of value is  Market Value . While  USPAP  does not define Market Value, it provides general guidance for how Market Value should be defined:   a type of value, stated as an opinion, that presumes the transfer or sale of a property as of a certain date, under specific conditions set forth in the definition of the term identified by the appraiser as applicable in an appraisal.   Thus, the definition of value used in an appraisal or CMA analysis and report is a set of assumptions about the market in which the subject property may transact. It becomes the basis for selecting comparable data for use in the analysis. These assumptions will vary from definition to definition but generally fall into three categories:     [ edit ]   Three approaches to value   There are three general groups of methodologies for determining value. These are usually referred to as the ""three approaches to value"":     The  cost approach   The  sales comparison approach  and   The  income approach     However, the recent trend of the business tends to be clining to the scientific methodology of appraisal which lies on the foundation of quantitative-data  [ 3 ] , risk and geographical based approaches  [ 4 ] ,   [ 5 ] . Pagourtzi  et al.  have provided a review on the methods used in the industry by comparison between conventional approaches and advanced ones  [ 6 ] .   The appraiser using three approaches will determine which one or more of these approaches may be applicable, based on the scope of work determination, and from that develop an appraisal analysis. Costs, income, and sales vary widely from one situation to the next, and particular importance is given to the specific characteristics of the subject.   Consideration is also given to the market for the property appraised. Appraisals of properties that are typically purchased by investors (e.g. - skyscrapers) may give greater weight to the income approach, while small retail or office properties, often purchased by owner-users, may give greater weighting to the sales comparison approach. While this may seem simple, it is not always obvious. For example, apartment complexes of a given quality tend to sell at a price per apartment, and as such the sales comparison approach may be more applicable. Single family residences are most commonly valued with greatest weighting to the sales comparison approach, but if a single family dwelling is in a neighborhood where all or most of the dwellings are rental units, then some variant of the income approach may be more useful.     [ edit ]   The cost approach   The  cost approach  was formerly called the summation approach. The theory is that the value of a property can be estimated by summing the land value and the depreciated value of any improvements. The value of the improvements is often referred to by the abbreviation RCNLD (reproduction cost new less depreciation or replacement cost new less depreciation). Reproduction refers to reproducing an exact replica. Replacement cost refers to the cost of building a house or other improvement which has the same utility, but using modern design, workmanship and materials. In practice, appraisers use replacement cost and then deduct a factor for any functional disutility associated with the age of the subject property.   In most instances when the cost approach is involved, the overall methodology is a hybrid of the cost and sales comparison approaches. For example, while the replacement cost to construct a building can be determined by adding the labor, material, and other costs, land values and depreciation must be derived from an analysis of comparable data.   The cost approach is considered reliable when used on newer structures, but the method tends to become less reliable for older properties. The cost approach is often the only reliable approach when dealing with special use properties (e.g. -- public assembly, marinas).     [ edit ]   The sales comparison approach   Template:Comparitive Market Analysis   The  Comparitive Market Analysis (CMA)  examines the price or price per unit/SF area of similar properties being sold in the marketplace. * Similar properties are of similar square footage, number of levels, age of the home, condition of the home, and area proximity of the subject home. Simply put, the sales of properties similar to the subject are analyzed and the sale prices adjusted to account for differences in the comparables to the subject to determine the value of the subject. This approach is generally considered the most reliable if adequate comparable sales exist. In any event, it is the only independent check on the reasonability of an appraisal opinion. Comparables used by appraisers are considered ""worthy"" or able to be used by the appraiser if they were sold within the last 12 months of the appraisal date of the subject property. Some appraiser are allowed sales only witin 6 months of the subject property. This differs with each company that is hired to appraise the subject property.   The above information holds true also when a Professional Licensed Real Estate Agent prepares a CMA ( comparitive market analysis) on the subject property.   When initially preparing a CMA, an agent will search back 12 months from the day of CMA preparation. Keep in mind, that when the subject home agrees to terms between buyer and seller or gets an ""accepted offer"", the lender of the BUYER will order the ""Appraisal"". Some comps that were originally used may not be ""worthy comps"" depending on the date the comparable was sold. Again, comps are worthy witin 12 months of the appraisal date of the subject property...........     [ edit ]   The income capitalization approach   Main article:  Income approach   The income capitalization approach  (often referred to simply as the ""income approach"") is used to value commercial and investment properties. Because it is intended to directly reflect or model the expectations and behaviors of typical market participants, this approach is generally considered the most applicable valuation technique for income-producing properties, where sufficient market data exists to supply the necessary inputs and parameters for this approach.   In a commercial income-producing property this approach capitalizes an income stream into a value indication. This can be done using revenue multipliers or  capitalization rates  applied to the first-year Net Operating Income. The Net Operating Income (NOI) is gross potential income (GPI), less vacancy and collection loss (= Effective Gross Income) less operating expenses (but excluding debt service, income taxes, and/or depreciation charges applied by accountants).   Alternatively, multiple years of net operating income can be valued by a  discounted cash flow  analysis (DCF) model. The DCF model is widely used to value larger and more expensive income-producing properties, such as large office towers. This technique applies market-supported yields (or discount rates) to future cash flows (such as annual income figures and typically a lump reversion from the eventual sale of the property) to arrive at a present value indication.     [ edit ]   UK valuation methods   In the UK, valuation methodology has traditionally been classified into five methods:     1.  Comparable method . Used for most types of property where there is good evidence of previous sales. This is analogous to the sales comparison approach outlined above.       2.  Investment/income method . Used for most commercial (and residential) property that is producing future cash flows through the letting of the property. If the current Estimated Rental Value (ERV) and the passing income are known, as well as the market-determined  equivalent yield , then the property value can be determined by means of a simple model. Note that this method is really a comparison method, since the main variables are determined in the market. In standard US practice, however, the closely related capitalising of NOI is confounded with the DCF method under the general classification of the income capitalization approach (see above).       3.  Accounts/profits method . Used for trading properties where evidence of rates is slight, such as hotels, restaurants and old-age homes. A three-year average of operating income (derived from the profit and loss or  income statement ) is capitalised using an appropriate yield. Note that since the variables used are inherent to the property and are not market-derived, therefore unless appropriate adjustments are made, the resulting value will be Value-in-Use or Investment Value, not  Market Value .       4.  Development/residual method . Used for properties ripe for development or redevelopment or for bare land only.       5.  Contractor's/cost method . Used for only those properties not bought and sold on the market. Both the development/residual method and the contractor's/cost method would be grouped in the US under the  cost approach  (see above).       [ edit ]   Further considerations     [ edit ]   Scope of work   While USPAP has always required appraisers to identify the scope of work needed to produce credible results, it became clear in recent years that appraisers did not fully understand the process for developing this adequately. In formulating the scope of work for a credible appraisal, the concept of a  limited  versus  complete  appraisal and the use of the Departure Rule caused confusion to clients, appraisers, and appraisal reviewers. In order to deal with this, USPAP was updated in 2006 with what came to be known as the Scope of Work project. In short, USPAP eliminated the Departure Rule and the concept of a limited appraisal and created a new Scope of Work rule. In this, appraisers were to identify six key parts of the appraisal problem at the beginning of each assignment:     Client and other intended users   Intended use of the appraisal and appraisal report   Definition of value (e.g. -- market, foreclosure, investment)   Any hypothetical conditions or extraordinary assumptions   The effective date of the appraisal analysis   The salient features of the subject property     Based on these factors, the appraiser must identify the scope of work needed, including the methodologies to be used, the extent of investigation, and the applicable approaches to value. The rule provided the explicit requirement that the minimum standards for scope of work were:     Expectations of the client and other users   The actions of the appraiser's peers who carry out similar assignments     The Scope of Work is the first step in any appraisal process. Without a strictly defined Scope of Work an appraisal's conclusions may not be viable. By defining the Scope of Work an appraiser can begin to actually develop a value for a given property for the intended user, which is the intended use of the appraisal.     [ edit ]   Highest and best use   Main article:  Highest and best use   Highest and Best Use  (HABU) is a term of art in the appraisal process. It is a process to determine the use of the property which produces the highest value for the land, as if vacant. There are four steps to the process. First, the appraiser determines all uses which are legally permissible for the property. Second, of the uses which are legally permissible, which ones are physically possible. Of those, which ones are financially feasible (sometimes referred to as  economically supported ). Of those uses which are feasible, which one and only use is maximally productive for the site. In a simple context, the appraiser must do this twice, comparing the results -- as if the land is vacant and in the as-is-improved state, taking into account the costs of demolishing any existing improvements. The outcome of this process is the highest and best use for the site. An appraisal of market value must explicitly assume that the owner or buyer would employ the property in its highest and best use, and therefore value the site accordingly.   In more complex appraisal assignments (e.g. -- contract disputes, litigation, brownfield or contaminated property valuation), the determination of highest and best use may be much more complex, and may need to take into account the various intermediate or temporary uses of the site, the contamination remediation process, and the timing of various legal issues. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Types of ownership interest   Implicit in the analysis of the subject property is a determination of the interest in the property being appraised. For most common situations (e.g. -- mortgage finance) the  fee simple  interest is explicitly assumed since it is the most complete bundle of rights available. However, in many situations, and in many societies which do not follow English Common Law or the Napoleanic Code, some other interest may be more common. While there are many different possible interests in real estate, the three most common are:     Fee simple value  (known in the UK as  freehold ) - The most complete ownership in real estate, subject in common law countries to the powers reserved to the state (taxation, escheat, eminent domain, and police power)       Leased fee value  - This is simply the fee simple interest encumbered by a lease. If the lease is at market rent, then the leased fee value and the fee simple value are equal. However, if the tenant pays more or less than market, the residual owned by the leased fee holder, plus the market value of the tenancy, may be more or less than the fee simple value.       Leasehold value  - The interest held by a tenant. If the tenant pays market rent, then the leasehold has no market value. However, if the tenant pays less than market, the difference betweent the present value of what is paid and the present value of market rents would be a positive leasehold value. For example, a major chain retailer may be able to negotiate a below-market lease to serve as the anchor tenant for a shopping center. This leasehold value may be transferrable to another anchor tenant, and if so the retail tenant has a positive interest in the real estate.       [ edit ]   Mass appraisal and automated valuation models   Automated valuation models  (AVMs) are growing in acceptance. These rely on statistical models such as multiple regression analysis or geographic information systems (GIS). [ 8 ]  While AVMs can be quite accurate, particularly when used in a very homogeneous area, there is also evidence that AVMs are not accurate in other instances such as when they are used in rural areas, or when the appraised property does not conform well to the neighborhood. AVM's have also gained favor in class action litigation, and have been substantiated in numerous cases, both in Federal and state courts, as the appropriate method for dealing with large-scale real estate litigation problems, such as contaminated neighborhoods [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Governing authorities and professional organizations     [ edit ]   International   The various US and international professional organizations have started collaborating in recent years towards the development of  International Valuation Standards  which will facilitate global real estate appraisal, a much-needed adjunct to real estate investment portfolios which transcend national boundaries.   The IVSC - The  International Valuation Standards Committee , is a  Non-governmental Organisation (NGO)  member of the  UN , with membership that encompasses all the major national valuation standard-setters and professional associations from 41 different countries (including the  Appraisal Institute , the  RICS  and the  Appraisal Institute of Canada ). IVSC have published the  International Valuation Standards (IVS) , now in their 8th edition.     [ edit ]   Germany   In  Germany , real estate appraisal is known as real estate valuation ( Immobilienbewertung ). Real estate appraisers ( Immobilienbewerter  or  Gutachter ) can qualify to become a  ffentlich bestellter und vereidigter Sachverstndiger  (officially appointed and sworn expert). However, this formerly very important title has lost a lot of its importance over the past years, but still is of some value in court procedures. The title is not generally required for appraisals.   Governing authorities  The real estate appraisal practice in Germany is partly codified by law. The federal  Baugesetzbuch  (abbr. BauGB, ""German statutory code on building and construction'"") contains guidelines on governing authorities, defines the term market value and refers to continuative rules (chapter 3, articles 192 ff.). Each municipality (city or administrative district) has to form a  Gutachterausschuss  (appraisal committee), consisting of a chairman and honorary members  [ 10 ] . The committee gathers information on all real estate deals (it is mandatory to send a copy of each notarial purchase contract to the  Gutachterausschuss ) and includes it in the  Kaufpreissammlung  (purchase price database). Most committees publish an official real estate market report every two years, in which besides other information on comparables the land value is determined. The committees also perform appraisals on behalf of public authorities.   Federal regulations  The BauGB defines the  Verkehrswert  or  Marktwert  (market value, both terms with identical meaning) as follows: ""The market value is determined by the price that can be realised at the date of valuation, in an arm's length transaction, with due regard to the legal situation and the effective characteristics, the nature and lay of the premises or any other subject of the valuation""  [ 11 ]  (non-official translation). The intention, as in other countries, is to include all objective influences and to exclude all influences resulting from the subjective circumstances of the involved parties.   This federal law is supported by the  Wertermittlungsverordnung  (abbr. WertV, ""regulation on the determination of value"")  [ 12 ] . The WertV defines the codified valuation approaches and the general valuation technique. German codified valuation approaches (other apporaches such as DCF or residual approach are also permitted, but not codified) are the:     Vergleichswertverfahren  (sales comparison approach) - used where good evidence of previous sales is available and for owner-occupied assets, especially condominiums and single-family houses;   Ertragswertverfahren  (German income approach) - standard procedure for property that produces future cash flows from the letting of the property;   Sachwertverfahren  (German cost approach) - used for specialised property where none of the above approaches applies, e. g. public buildings.     WertV's general regulations are further supported by the  Wertermittlungsrichtlinie  (abbr. WertR, ""directive on the determination of value"")  [ 13 ] . The WertR provides templates for calculations, tables (e. g. economic depreciation) and guidelines for the consideration of different influences. WertV and WertR are not binding for appraisals for nonofficial use, nonetheless they should be regarded as  best practice  or Generally Accepted (German) Valuation Practice (GAVP).   Comments on German GAVP  In most regards Generally Accepted (German) Valuation Principles is consistent with international practice. The investment market weighs the income approach most heavily. However, there are some important differences:     Land and improvements are treated separately. German GAVP assumes that the land can be used indefinitely, but the buildings have a limited lifespan; This coincides with the balancing of the assets. The value of the land is determined by the sales comparison approach in both the income and cost approaches, using the data accumulated by the  Gutachterausschuss  which is then added to the building value.   In order to account for the usage of the land, the  net operating income  is reduced by the  Liegenschaftszins  (interest paid to the land-owner by the owner of the building, i.e. ground rent). The  Liegenschaftszins  is the product of the land value and the  Liegenschaftszinssatz  (interest rate for land-use). The  Liegenschaftszinssatz  is the equivalent of the yield - with some important differences - and is also determined by the  Gutachterausschuss .   Unlike the All Risks Yield (ARY) in UK practice, the  Liegenschaftszinssatz  (abbr. LZ) does not include an allowance for default (not to be confused with structural vacancy), therefore this needs to be subtracted from  gross operating income . As a result, the  Liegenschaftszinssatz  will usually be lower than the All Risks Yield.   Based on the assumption that the economic life of the improvements is limited, the yield and remaining economic life determine the building value from the net operating income.   It should also be observed that contracts in Germany generally prescribe that the landlord bears a higher portion of maintenance and operating costs than their counterparts in the US and UK.     Criticism  Mathematically the distinction between land and improvements in the income approach will have no impact on the overall value when the remaining economic life is more than thirty years. For this reason it has become quite common to use the  Vereinfachtes Ertragswertverfahren  (simplified income approach), omitting the land value and the  Liegenschaftszins . However, the separate treatment of land and buildings leads to more precise results for older buildings, especially for commercial buildings, which typically have a shorter economic life than residential buildings.   An advantage of the comparatively high degree of standardization practiced by professional appraisers, is the greater ability to check an appraisal for inconsistency, accuracy and transparency.   Professional organisations  The Federal German Organisation of Appointed and Sworn Experts ( Bundesverband Deutscher Sachverstndiger und Fachgutachter , abbr. BDSF) [ 14 ]  is the main professional organisation encompassing the majority of licensed appraisers in Germany. In recent years, with the move towards a more global outlook in the valuation profession, the  RICS  has gained a foothold in Germany, somewhat at the expense of the BDSF.   With special focus on hypothecary value, in 1996, German banks with real estate financing activities formed the  HypZert GmbH [ 15 ] , an association for the certification of real estate valuers. A  HypZert  qualification is regarded as mandatory for their appraisers by many German banks.     [ edit ]   Israel   In  Israel , the real estate appraisal profession is regulated by the Council of Land Valuers, an organ of the Ministry of Justice; the largest professional organisation, encompassing the majority of appraisers/land valuers is the Association of Land Valuers. Valuers must be registered with the Council, which is a statutory body set up by law, and which oversees the training and administers the national professional exams that are a prerequisite for attaining registration. In 2005 the Council set up a Valuation Standards Committee with the purpose of developing and promulgating Standards that would reflect best practice; these have tended to follow a rules-based approach.   Historically, most valuations in Israel were statutory valuations (such as valuations performed for purposes of  Betterment Tax  - a tax administered on any gains accruing to the property by way of changes to the local planning) as well as valuations performed for purposes of bank lending. This is now changing: since the adoption in Israel of  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  (were adopted in 2006; will fully come into effect in 2008), the profession has been additionally engaged in performing valuations for purposes of financial reporting.     [ edit ]   Japan   The  Japanese Association of Real Estate Appraisal , established in 1965, is the only certified association and is regulated by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transportation and Tourism.     [ edit ]   United Kingdom   In the  UK , real estate appraisal is known as  property valuation  and a real estate appraiser is a  land valuer  or  property valuer  (usually a qualified  chartered surveyor  who specialises in property valuation). Property valuation in the UK is regulated by the  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors  (RICS), a professional body encompassing all of the building and property-related professions. The RICS professional guidelines for valuers are published in the  RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards , commonly known as the  Red Book . While based in the UK, RICS is a global organization and has become very active in the US in recent years through its affiliation with the Counselors of Real Estate, a division of the National Association of Realtors.     [ edit ]   United States   Appraisal practice in the US is regulated by the various states. The  Financial Institutions Reform and Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA)  of 1989 demanded all the states to develop systems for licensing and certifying real estate appraisers. [ 16 ]  To accomplish this, the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) was formed, with representatives from the various Federal mortgage regulatory agencies. [ 17 ]  Thus, currently all the  real estate  appraisers must be state-licensed and certified. But prior to the 1990s, there were no commonly accepted standards either for appraisal quality or for appraiser licensure. In the 1980s, an ad-hoc committee representing various appraisal professional organizations in the U.S. and Canada met to codify the best practices into what became known as the  Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) . The  Savings and Loan Crisis  in the U.S. resulted in increased Federal regulation of the mortgage lending process via the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1991. A portion of this act required federal lending regulators to adopt appraisal standards. A not-for-profit organization, the  Appraisal Foundation  (TAF), was formed by the same organizations which had developed USPAP, and the copyright for USPAP was signed over to TAF. Federal oversight of TAF is provided by the Appraisal Subcommittee, made up of representatives of various Federal lending regulators. TAF carries out its work through two boards: the Appraisal Standards Board promulgates and updates USPAP; the Appraisal Qualifications Board (AQB) promulgates minimum recommended standards for appraiser certification and licensure. During the 1990s, all of the states adopted USPAP as the governing standards within their states and developed licensure standards which met or exceeded the recommendations of TAF. Also, the various state and federal courts have adopted USPAP for real estate litigation and all of the federally lending regulators adopt USPAP for mortgage finance appraisal. [ 17 ]   In addition, there are professional appraisal organizations, organized as private not-for-profits, which date to the  Great Depression  of the 1930s. One of the oldest in the U.S. is the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers (ASFMRA), founded in 1929. [ 18 ]  Others were founded as needed and opportunity arose in specialized fields, such as the Appraisal Institute (AI) and the American Society of Appraisers (ASA) founded in the 1930s, the International Right of Way Association and the National Association of Realtors which were founded after World War II. These organizations all existed to establish and enforce standards, but their influence has waned as the government increases appraisal regulation. In March 2007, three of these organizations (ASFMRA, ASA, and AI) announced an agreement in principle to merge. NAIFA (National Association of Independent Fee Appraisers), a charter member of The Appraisal Foundation, helped to write Title XI, the Real Estate Appraisal Reform Amendments. It was founded in 1961.   The best known professional organization of real estate appraisers in America is the  Appraisal Institute . It was formed in from the merger of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers and the Society of Real Estate Appraisers. Founded along with others in the 1930s, the two organizations merged in the 1990s to form the  Appraisal Institute  (AI). This group awards two professional designations:  SRA , to residential appraisers, and  MAI , to commercial appraisers. The Institute has enacted rigorous regulations regarding to the use and display of these designations. For example, contrary to popular belief, ""MAI"" does  not  stand for ""Member, Appraisal Institute"". According to the institute, the letters ""do not represent specific words"", and an MAI may not use the words ""Member, Appraisal Institute"" in lieu of the MAI mark. The primary motive for this rule is to prevent dilution of the trademark.   Other leading appraisal organizations include the  American Society of Appraisers ,  National Association of Independent Fee Appraisers , and the  National Association of Master Appraisers , which were also founding sponsor-members of the Appraisal Foundation. [ 19 ]  The  Massachusetts Board of Real Estate Appraisers  (MBREA), founded in 1934, is the only state appraisal association that has been named a sponsor of the Appraisal Foundation.  [ 20 ]  In recent years, the  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)  has become highly regarded in the US, and has formed a collaboration with the Counselors of Real Estate, a division of the  National Association of Realtors . RICS, which is headquartered in London, operates on a global scale and awards the designations  MRICS  and  FRICS  to Members and Fellows of RICS. The  Real Estate Counseling Group of America  is a small group of the top appraisers and real estate analysts in the US who collectively have authored a disproportionately large body of appraisal methodology.

In the  common law  systems personal property may also be called  chattels  or  personalty . It is distinguished from  real property , or  real estate . In the  civil law  systems personal property is often called  movable property  or  movables  - any property that can be moved from one location to another. This term is in distinction with  immovable property  or immovables, such as land and buildings.   Historically,  slaves  have often been legally treated as personal property. In some cultures, servants, wives and children have also been considered to greater or lesser degrees to be the personal property ( chattel ) of their husbands, fathers or guardians. For example, in Biblical times, the ancient Hebrews were permitted to sell their daughters into servitude, and servants could be bought or sold as slaves were - although Hebrew servants could not be legally sold to aliens, and male Hebrew servants were set free after serving for 7 years. (see Exodus 20 for details). Even in Victorian times, children could be bought and sold - as chronicled in  Charles Dickens 's novel  Oliver Twist .   Personal property may be classified in a variety of ways.  Tangible personal property  refers to any type of property that can generally be moved (i.e., it is not attached to real property or land), touched or felt. These generally include items such as furniture, clothing, jewelry, art, writings, or household goods. In some cases, there can be formal title documents that show the ownership and transfer rights of that property after a person's death (for example, motor vehicles, boats, etc.) In many cases, however, tangible personal property will not be ""titled"" in an owner's name and is presumed to be whatever property he or she was in possession of at the time of his or her death.   Intangible personal property  or ""intangibles"" refers to personal property that cannot be actually ""moved"" touched or felt, but instead represents something of value such as  negotiable instruments ,  securities ,  goods , and  intangible assets  including  chose in action .   Accountants also distinguish personal property from real property because personal property can be  depreciated  faster than improvements (while land is not depreciable at all). It is an owner's right to get tax benefits for chattel, and there are businesses that specialize in appraising personal property, or chattel.   The distinction between these types of property is significant for a variety of reasons. Usually one's rights on movables are more attenuated than one's rights on immovables (or real property). The  statutes of limitations  or  prescriptive periods  are usually shorter when dealing with personal or movable property. Real property rights are usually enforceable for a much longer period of time and in most jurisdictions real estate and immovables are registered in government-sanctioned land registers. In some jurisdictions, rights (such as a  lien  or other security interest) can be registered against personal or movable property.   In the common law it is possible to place a  mortgage  upon real property. Such mortgage requires payment or the owner of the mortgage can seek  foreclosure . Personal property can often be secured with similar kind of device, variously called a  chattel mortgage , trust receipt, or  security interest . In the United States, Article 9 of the  Uniform Commercial Code  governs the creation and enforcement of security interests in most (but not all) types of personal property.   There is no similar institution to the mortgage in the civil law, however a  hypothec  is a device to secure  real rights  against property. These real rights follow the property along with the ownership. In the common law a lien also remains on the property and it is not extinguished by alienation of the property; liens may be real or  equitable .   Many jurisdictions levy a personal  property tax , an annual tax on the privilege of owning or possessing personal property within the boundaries of the jurisdiction. Automobile and boat registration fees are a subset of this tax. Most household goods are exempt as long as they are kept or used within the household; the tax usually becomes a problem when the taxing authority discovers that expensive personal property like art is being regularly stored outside of the household.     [ edit ]   Personal vs Private property   In political/economic theory, notably  anarchism ,  communism  and some  socialist  philosophies, the distinction between private and personal property is extremely important. They are separated by a blurry boundary, which items of property constitute which is open to debate.     Personal property  is part of your person and includes property from which you have the right to exclude others (e.g TVs, cars, clothes etc). [ 1 ]       Private property  is a  social relationship , not a relationship between person and thing according to  Marx  (e.g factories, mines, dams, infrastructure etc). In  capitalism  there is no distinction between personal and private property. [ 2 ]       To many socialists, the term  private property  refers to capital or the means of production, while personal property refers to consumer and non-capital goods and services.

Our staff includes 60 appraisers that are continually collecting property           data. After analyzing sales of all types of properties, the data is           entered into our computer assisted mass appraisal (CAMA) system to           estimate values of more than 425,000 parcels.                          Why would my property value increase if I haven                           done anything  to it?          Real estate values are established by buyers and sellers acting independently.         If sale prices in your area increase, the market value of your property         may increase. This is basic supply and demand of the marketplace.                         Can the Property Appraiser lower  my                           taxes or change my tax rates?          The answer is no. Tax rates and taxes are set by your  local         taxing authorities,         such as the School Board, Board of County Commissioners, Children Board,         City Councils, Library, Transit Authority, Water Management District         (SWFWMD), etc.                          How long will it take for a review  of                           my property?          We will answer general questions on the phone immediately and refer specific         valuation questions to our appraisers. Our goal is to have an appraiser         call you within five business days.                          Why is there a difference  in                           the market, assessed and taxable values?            Market value of your property is the most probable sales price your property         should bring in a competitive and open market. Assessed value may be         lower than the market value if subject to the Amendment 10 cap. Taxable         value is the assessed value less reductions from applicable exemptions.

Section 193.155(1) of the Florida Statutes was enacted                           to implement an amendment to the state constitution                           to limit annual increases in property value assessments                           on real property qualifying for and receiving homestead                           exemption.                                                                            How does the amendment limitation                             apply?                             Real property shall be assessed at full market value                           (just value) as of January 1 of the year in which the                           property first receives the homestead exemption.                              The following year the property is reassessed                               and any changes from the prior year's value is                               not to exceed the lesser of 3% of that prior year                               assessed value or the Consumer Price Index (CPI)                               change, with the exception of changes, additions                               or improvements.                                                                                                                                        How is my property affected?                           The year following the granting of homestead exemption                           the property is subject to the limitation.                                                                           What about any changes,                             additions or improvements to the homestead property?                             New construction or additions shall be assessed at                           full market value as of the first January 1 after the                           changes are substantially completed. In these circumstances,                           it is possible that the assessed value may exceed the                           amendment limitations. However; after the first year                           that the changes are assessed at full market value,                           they also are subject to the amendment limitations.                                                                           What properties are not                             subject to the limitation?                             Residences without homestead, non-residential property,                           vacant land, tangible personal property, commercial                           property, and agricultural property, are not eligible                           for the amendment limitation.                                                                           Why would my assessment                             increase when my market value stayed the same?                             This is probably due to the ""recapture"" rule.                           In 1995, the Department of Revenue adopted a rule approved                           by the Governor and Cabinet directing property appraisers                           to raise the assessed value of a qualifying homestead                           property by the maximum of 3% or the Consumer Price                           Index, whichever is less, on all properties assessed                           at less than full market value.                                                                           What happens if a property                             is sold or conveyed to a new owner?                             Once the property has been conveyed to the new owner,                           it is raised to full market value January 1 of the                           following year. The new owner must apply for and receive                           homestead exemption.                              Even if the property received a homestead exemption                               under the previous owner, the limitation, just                               like the exemption, expires January 1 of the year                               following a change of ownership.

If you plan on purchasing a new home or  refinancing your current loan , you will need to order an appraisal.  Usually a bank or  mortgage broker  will handle this for you, but you will still have to foot the bill unless it’s built into your mortgage rate.   Appraisals typically cost anywhere from $250 to $500.  The cost will vary based on property type, location, and square footage.  Multi-unit properties and properties in rural areas will usually cost more to be appraised than a single-family residence in a densely populated area.   The most common type of appraisal is the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report, or URAR.  It consists of interior and exterior photos, comparison sales, and a complete cost breakdown of the property. This type of appraisal is a blend of both a market and cost approach.  The cost approach establishes value by determining what the cost would be to rebuild the structure from the ground up.  The value approach determines value with comparison sales in the immediate area that have sold within a recent period of time.   The comparison sales are broken down in the appraisal report as well, and compared to the subject property.  Each comparison sale is given or deducted value in a number of categories based on how it stacks up against the subject property.  The net value of the comparison sales are then averaged to come up with a median appraised value for the subject property.   The value of the subject property is really the most important factor when it comes to securing financing.  Banks and  mortgage lenders  need to ensure your property is in good condition, and truly worth what you or your broker say it’s worth.  Any possible valuation inconsistencies will likely cause investors to shy away from purchasing the mortgage, leaving the bank or lender with a vacant property and a major loss.  Even Donald Trump could buy a shack and fail to obtain a mortgage because the property itself simply isn’t marketable.   Once an appraisal is ordered, most banks and lenders will order a review of the appraisal.  This review will be conducted by another appraiser or simply by use of an AVM, or  Automated valuation model . This is where many borrowers get into trouble.  If the review comes in low, or if the property is deemed incomplete, hazardous, or unique in anyway, a bank may decline the deal and deny financing to the potential borrower.  Even if the borrower has outstanding credit and assets galore, a faulty, unique, or overvalued property can kill a deal.   That’s why it’s always important to use a qualified appraiser who assigns a realistic value to your home so there aren’t any surprises when it’s do or die time.  It’s better to know the true value of your home upfront before you sign any contingencies or purchase contracts. And remember that the quality of your appraisal will determine the quality of your review (unless it’s automated).   The review appraiser will always find the value based on what’s given to them.  If they receive a poor appraisal report, they will likely assign a poor value. I’ve seen brokers submit multiple appraisals and receive completely different values based solely on the original appraisal itself.   Although an appraisal is irreplaceable, you can do some quick research on your own by using a  free internet house values  tool that generates a property appraisal in a matter of seconds by simply typing in the home address.  You can find out the sales history of a home, comparison sales, and value based on city, county, and state.                                                                                                                    get free e-mail updates     subscribe in a reader              Mortgage Advice          Alt-A Mortgages | Alt-A Lending   Appraisals and Appraised Value   Biweekly Mortgage Payments   Buying Down Your Interest Rate   Cash-out Refinance   Debt-to-Income Ratio   Documents Needed for a Loan   Foreclosure Help   Home Equity Line of Credit   How Mortgage Rates Move   Loan Types and Programs   Mortgage Brokers vs. Banks   Mortgage Calculators   Mortgage Combos and Blended Rate   Mortgage Dictionary   Mortgage Mistakes   Mortgage Pricing Adjustments   No Cost Refinance Loans   Option Arm Mortgages   Prepayment penalty   Rate and Term Refinance   Right of Rescission   Second Mortgages   Stated Income Loans   Subprime Lending   What is a mortgage?         *see all help topics                         Other Great Sites      Calculated Risk   LoanWorkout.org   Mortgage Implode                                       © 2006-2008 The Truth About Mortgage.com Photos taken by  me  unless otherwise noted.

Tangible personal property returns are mailed January                           1 of each year. The return forms must be postmarked                           no later than April 1 to avoid penalties.                            The penalties are 5% for each month or part thereof                           that they are received late up to a maximum of a 25%                           penalty. Extensions may be granted up to May 15. The                           extension requests must be received by April 1, and                           must state the reason for the request. The folio number,                           business name, and location of the business is required.

Tangible Personal Property is everything other than real estate.  It includes furniture, fixtures, tools,        machinery, signs, equipment, leasehold improvements, supplies, leased equipment and any other equipment        used in a business or to earn an income.                WHO MUST FILE?        Anyone in possession of assets on January 1 who has either a proprietorship, partnership, corporation or        is a self-employed agent or contractor must file each year.  Property owners receiving a Greenbelt        classification and any one who leases, loans or rents property must also file.                WHEN MUST I FILE A RETURN?        All Tangible Personal Property Tax Returns must be filed by April 1 each year in order to avoid penalties.                WHY MUST I FILE A RETURN?        Florida Statute 193.052 requires that all tangible personal property be reported each year to the        Property Appraiser's Office.  If you receive a return, it is because the Property Appraiser's Office        has determined that you may have property to report.  If you feel the form is not applicable, return it with        an explanation.  Either way, the form must be returned.  If you do not receive a Tangible Personal Property        Return (DR-405), you are still required to submit a return if you have assets to report.  Failure to receive        a tangible return does not relieve you of your obligation to file.                HOW CAN I OBTAIN A TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY RETURN FORM?        If you do not receive a Tangible Return within the first two weeks of the year, you may download a form from        our web site at hcpafl.org. Forms are also available at all of the Property Appraiser's locations.                 WHAT IF I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX RETURN?        All returns must be sent back.  If you have more than one location, the assets of each location should be        listed separately on each return.  If you have only one location but were required to take out more than        one occupational license, indicate on one return that all assets are reported on the other.                WHAT IF I HAVE NO ASSETS TO REPORT?        Even if you feel you have nothing to report, fill out items 1 through 9 on the Tangible Personal Property        Tax Returns, attach an explanation about why nothing was reported and file it with the Property Appraiser's        office.                IF I AM NO LONGER IN BUSINESS, SHOULD I STILL FILE THE RETURN?        Yes.  If you are not in business on January 1, indicate on the Tangible Personal Property Tax Returns the        date you closed the business and the manner in which you disposed of your business assets.                 WHAT IF I BUY OR SELL AN EXISTING BUSINESS DURING THE YEAR, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TAXES?         The owner is responsible.  Tangible taxes should be pro-rated at the time of transfer of ownership as are        the taxes on real estate.  Should the assessed owner not pay the taxes, the assessed property may be seized        and sold to discharge the lien.                 WHAT IF I HAVE OLD EQUIPMENT THAT HAS BEEN FULLY DEPRECIATED AND WRITTEN OFF THE BOOKS?        All property must be reported.  IRS provides rapid depreciation which does not necessarily reflect market value.            DO I HAVE TO REPORT ASSETS THAT I LEASE, LOAN, RENT, BORROW OR ARE PROVIDED IN THE RENT?        Yes.  There is a specific area on the Tangible Personal Property Tax Return form to list these assets.         Normally, the lessee is not assessed for the assets.  They are assessed to the owner.  Be aware that most        leasing companies will probably bill you for their tax liability separately.  Consult your lease or contract        for a determination.                IS THERE A MINIMUM VALUE THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO REPORT?        No.  There is no minimum value.  A Tangible Personal Property Tax Return must be filed on all assets.  However,        if the resulting property taxes amount to less than $15.00, you will not receive a tax bill.                WHAT IF MY EQUIPMENT IS IN POOR CONDITION?        You should provide additional documentation for the poor condition of the equipment.  You may also request a        site inspection from our office.                WHAT IF I SOLD SOME EQUIPMENT LAST YEAR, DO I STILL HAVE TO REPORT IT?        Yes.  There is a specific section on the return to list assets that are no longer in your possession and have        been ""Physically Removed"" either by being traded in, stolen or sold.  This does not include assets        that have been fully depreciated or are being used as spare parts.                 WHAT ARE THE DEADLINES AND PENALTIES?        The deadline for filing the Tangible Return is April 1.  After April 1, Florida statutes provide that late        penalties be applied at 5% per month, but not to exceed 25%.  A 15% penalty is required for unreported property        and a 25% penalty if no return is filed.

Before getting your first appraisal..               Be patient and careful when deciding who's going to sell your property. Some agencies will try to get you to let them sell your property by telling you a price that is in fact much higher than what your property can actually be sold for. This often ends up in a very long selling progress with few results.               We often hear the question ""How much is a property like this one worth?"", and the answer is that every property is unique. Since your residence is not in the same place in the building, doesn't have the same light as any other, and so on, the exact value can never be known, all anyone can make is an estimation, which is why different peoples opinions vary so much.

Let us make your appraisal                                                            Get More Information                                           Real Valuation              This is indispensable when beginning a good selling process, which is why a qualified professional will visit the property to appraise its actual state and other details that need to be kept in mind, but are different for each property and area where it can be found.                You will then be informed of the competitive sales value at which the property can be quickly sold. From the surveyor you will also receive information about the realty market trends at the time and the reasons why your property has the value that it does.

Appraisals and Confidentiality              An Appraisal is a personalized service, since you will receive a visit at the property and will be able to make questions about what the surveyor says and get explanations about the ""why's"" of certain subjects that influence the property value.                For your security you are also guaranteed complete confidentiality. The surveyor promises not to share the estimated value with anyone until a sales permit has been sign, after which it is obvious that the sale price needs to be exposed to potential buyers.                        Written Valuations              You can also ask for a written evaluation that, for a minimal cost, leaves you a written report that might be convenient for:                             Being accepted guarantees from commercial rentals or loans                 Deciding to buy                 Resolving family issues                Evaluating investment projects, etc.              If you want to, for an additional cost, you can ask for a report of credit risk, plus a list of possible inhibitions to the sale.

clueweb09-enwp01-19-20724	"                     Real estate appraisal          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Land valuation )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Real estate appraisal ,  property valuation  or  land valuation  is the practice of developing an opinion of the value of real property, usually its  Market Value . The need for appraisals arises from the heterogeneous nature of property as an investment class: no two properties are identical, and all properties differ from each other in their location - which is the most important determinant of their value. So there cannot exist a centralised  Walrasian auction  setting for the trading of property assets, as there exists for trade in corporate stock. The absence of a market-based pricing mechanism determines the need for an expert appraisal/valuation of real estate/property.   A real estate appraisal is performed by a licensed or certified appraiser (in many countries known as a  property valuer  or  land valuer  and in British English as a ""valuation surveyor""). If the appraiser's opinion is based on Market Value, then it must also be based on the  Highest and Best Use  of the  real property . For mortgage valuations of improved residential property in the US, the appraisal is most often reported on a standardized form, such as the  Uniform Residential Appraisal Report . [ 1 ]  Appraisals of more complex property (e.g. -- income producing, raw land) are usually reported in a narrative appraisal report.

Some of the most common are:     Market Value   The price at which an asset would trade in a competitive  Walrasian auction  setting. Market Value is usually interchangeable with  Open Market Value  or  Fair Value .  International Valuation Standards  (IVS) define Market Value as:           Market Value  is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgably, prudently, and without compulsion. [ 2 ]           Value-in-use   The net present value (NPV) of a cash flow that an asset generates for a specific owner under a specific use. Value-in-use is the value to one particular user, and is usually below the market value of a property.       Investment value  - is the value to one particular investor, and is usually higher than the market value of a property.       Insurable value  - is the value of real property covered by an  insurance policy . Generally it does not include the site value.       Liquidation value  -- may be analyzed as either a  forced liquidation  or an  orderly liquidation  and is a commonly sought standard of value in bankruptcy proceedings. It assumes a seller who is compelled to sell after an exposure period which is less than the market-normal timeframe.       [ edit ]   Price versus value   It is important to distinguish between  Market Value  and  Price . A price obtained for a specific property under a specific transaction may or may not represent that property's market value: special considerations may have been present, such as a special relationship between the buyer and the seller, or else the transaction may have been part of a larger set of transactions in which the parties had engaged. Another possibility is that a special buyer may have been willing to pay a premium over and above the market value, if his subjective valuation of the property (its  investment value  for him) was higher than the Market Value. An example of this would be the owner of a neighbouring property who, by combining his own property with the subject property, could thereby obtain economies-of-scale. Such situations often arise in corporate finance, as for example when a merger or acquisition is concluded at a price which is higher than the value represented by the price of the underlying stock. The usual rationale for these valuations would be that the 'sum is greater than its parts', since full ownership of a company entails special privileges for which a potential purchaser would be willing to pay. Such situations arise in real estate/property markets as well. It is the task of the real estate appraiser/property valuer to judge whether a specific price obtained under a specific transaction is indicative of Market Value.     [ edit ]   Market value definitions in the USA   In the US, appraisals are performed to a certain standard of value (e.g. -- foreclosure value, fair market value, distressed sale value, investment value). The most commonly used definition of value is  Market Value . While  USPAP  does not define Market Value, it provides general guidance for how Market Value should be defined:   a type of value, stated as an opinion, that presumes the transfer or sale of a property as of a certain date, under specific conditions set forth in the definition of the term identified by the appraiser as applicable in an appraisal.   Thus, the definition of value used in an appraisal or CMA analysis and report is a set of assumptions about the market in which the subject property may transact. It becomes the basis for selecting comparable data for use in the analysis. These assumptions will vary from definition to definition but generally fall into three categories:     [ edit ]   Three approaches to value   There are three general groups of methodologies for determining value. These are usually referred to as the ""three approaches to value"":     The  cost approach   The  sales comparison approach  and   The  income approach     However, the recent trend of the business tends to be clining to the scientific methodology of appraisal which lies on the foundation of quantitative-data  [ 3 ] , risk and geographical based approaches  [ 4 ] ,   [ 5 ] . Pagourtzi  et al.  have provided a review on the methods used in the industry by comparison between conventional approaches and advanced ones  [ 6 ] .   The appraiser using three approaches will determine which one or more of these approaches may be applicable, based on the scope of work determination, and from that develop an appraisal analysis. Costs, income, and sales vary widely from one situation to the next, and particular importance is given to the specific characteristics of the subject.   Consideration is also given to the market for the property appraised. Appraisals of properties that are typically purchased by investors (e.g. - skyscrapers) may give greater weight to the income approach, while small retail or office properties, often purchased by owner-users, may give greater weighting to the sales comparison approach. While this may seem simple, it is not always obvious. For example, apartment complexes of a given quality tend to sell at a price per apartment, and as such the sales comparison approach may be more applicable. Single family residences are most commonly valued with greatest weighting to the sales comparison approach, but if a single family dwelling is in a neighborhood where all or most of the dwellings are rental units, then some variant of the income approach may be more useful.     [ edit ]   The cost approach   The  cost approach  was formerly called the summation approach. The theory is that the value of a property can be estimated by summing the land value and the depreciated value of any improvements. The value of the improvements is often referred to by the abbreviation RCNLD (reproduction cost new less depreciation or replacement cost new less depreciation). Reproduction refers to reproducing an exact replica. Replacement cost refers to the cost of building a house or other improvement which has the same utility, but using modern design, workmanship and materials. In practice, appraisers use replacement cost and then deduct a factor for any functional disutility associated with the age of the subject property.   In most instances when the cost approach is involved, the overall methodology is a hybrid of the cost and sales comparison approaches. For example, while the replacement cost to construct a building can be determined by adding the labor, material, and other costs, land values and depreciation must be derived from an analysis of comparable data.   The cost approach is considered reliable when used on newer structures, but the method tends to become less reliable for older properties. The cost approach is often the only reliable approach when dealing with special use properties (e.g. -- public assembly, marinas).     [ edit ]   The sales comparison approach   Template:Comparitive Market Analysis   The  Comparitive Market Analysis (CMA)  examines the price or price per unit/SF area of similar properties being sold in the marketplace. * Similar properties are of similar square footage, number of levels, age of the home, condition of the home, and area proximity of the subject home. Simply put, the sales of properties similar to the subject are analyzed and the sale prices adjusted to account for differences in the comparables to the subject to determine the value of the subject. This approach is generally considered the most reliable if adequate comparable sales exist. In any event, it is the only independent check on the reasonability of an appraisal opinion. Comparables used by appraisers are considered ""worthy"" or able to be used by the appraiser if they were sold within the last 12 months of the appraisal date of the subject property. Some appraiser are allowed sales only witin 6 months of the subject property. This differs with each company that is hired to appraise the subject property.   The above information holds true also when a Professional Licensed Real Estate Agent prepares a CMA ( comparitive market analysis) on the subject property.   When initially preparing a CMA, an agent will search back 12 months from the day of CMA preparation. Keep in mind, that when the subject home agrees to terms between buyer and seller or gets an ""accepted offer"", the lender of the BUYER will order the ""Appraisal"". Some comps that were originally used may not be ""worthy comps"" depending on the date the comparable was sold. Again, comps are worthy witin 12 months of the appraisal date of the subject property...........     [ edit ]   The income capitalization approach   Main article:  Income approach   The income capitalization approach  (often referred to simply as the ""income approach"") is used to value commercial and investment properties. Because it is intended to directly reflect or model the expectations and behaviors of typical market participants, this approach is generally considered the most applicable valuation technique for income-producing properties, where sufficient market data exists to supply the necessary inputs and parameters for this approach.   In a commercial income-producing property this approach capitalizes an income stream into a value indication. This can be done using revenue multipliers or  capitalization rates  applied to the first-year Net Operating Income. The Net Operating Income (NOI) is gross potential income (GPI), less vacancy and collection loss (= Effective Gross Income) less operating expenses (but excluding debt service, income taxes, and/or depreciation charges applied by accountants).   Alternatively, multiple years of net operating income can be valued by a  discounted cash flow  analysis (DCF) model. The DCF model is widely used to value larger and more expensive income-producing properties, such as large office towers. This technique applies market-supported yields (or discount rates) to future cash flows (such as annual income figures and typically a lump reversion from the eventual sale of the property) to arrive at a present value indication.     [ edit ]   UK valuation methods   In the UK, valuation methodology has traditionally been classified into five methods:     1.  Comparable method . Used for most types of property where there is good evidence of previous sales. This is analogous to the sales comparison approach outlined above.       2.  Investment/income method . Used for most commercial (and residential) property that is producing future cash flows through the letting of the property. If the current Estimated Rental Value (ERV) and the passing income are known, as well as the market-determined  equivalent yield , then the property value can be determined by means of a simple model. Note that this method is really a comparison method, since the main variables are determined in the market. In standard US practice, however, the closely related capitalising of NOI is confounded with the DCF method under the general classification of the income capitalization approach (see above).       3.  Accounts/profits method . Used for trading properties where evidence of rates is slight, such as hotels, restaurants and old-age homes. A three-year average of operating income (derived from the profit and loss or  income statement ) is capitalised using an appropriate yield. Note that since the variables used are inherent to the property and are not market-derived, therefore unless appropriate adjustments are made, the resulting value will be Value-in-Use or Investment Value, not  Market Value .       4.  Development/residual method . Used for properties ripe for development or redevelopment or for bare land only.       5.  Contractor's/cost method . Used for only those properties not bought and sold on the market. Both the development/residual method and the contractor's/cost method would be grouped in the US under the  cost approach  (see above).       [ edit ]   Further considerations     [ edit ]   Scope of work   While USPAP has always required appraisers to identify the scope of work needed to produce credible results, it became clear in recent years that appraisers did not fully understand the process for developing this adequately. In formulating the scope of work for a credible appraisal, the concept of a  limited  versus  complete  appraisal and the use of the Departure Rule caused confusion to clients, appraisers, and appraisal reviewers. In order to deal with this, USPAP was updated in 2006 with what came to be known as the Scope of Work project. In short, USPAP eliminated the Departure Rule and the concept of a limited appraisal and created a new Scope of Work rule. In this, appraisers were to identify six key parts of the appraisal problem at the beginning of each assignment:     Client and other intended users   Intended use of the appraisal and appraisal report   Definition of value (e.g. -- market, foreclosure, investment)   Any hypothetical conditions or extraordinary assumptions   The effective date of the appraisal analysis   The salient features of the subject property     Based on these factors, the appraiser must identify the scope of work needed, including the methodologies to be used, the extent of investigation, and the applicable approaches to value. The rule provided the explicit requirement that the minimum standards for scope of work were:     Expectations of the client and other users   The actions of the appraiser's peers who carry out similar assignments     The Scope of Work is the first step in any appraisal process. Without a strictly defined Scope of Work an appraisal's conclusions may not be viable. By defining the Scope of Work an appraiser can begin to actually develop a value for a given property for the intended user, which is the intended use of the appraisal.     [ edit ]   Highest and best use   Main article:  Highest and best use   Highest and Best Use  (HABU) is a term of art in the appraisal process. It is a process to determine the use of the property which produces the highest value for the land, as if vacant. There are four steps to the process. First, the appraiser determines all uses which are legally permissible for the property. Second, of the uses which are legally permissible, which ones are physically possible. Of those, which ones are financially feasible (sometimes referred to as  economically supported ). Of those uses which are feasible, which one and only use is maximally productive for the site. In a simple context, the appraiser must do this twice, comparing the results -- as if the land is vacant and in the as-is-improved state, taking into account the costs of demolishing any existing improvements. The outcome of this process is the highest and best use for the site. An appraisal of market value must explicitly assume that the owner or buyer would employ the property in its highest and best use, and therefore value the site accordingly.   In more complex appraisal assignments (e.g. -- contract disputes, litigation, brownfield or contaminated property valuation), the determination of highest and best use may be much more complex, and may need to take into account the various intermediate or temporary uses of the site, the contamination remediation process, and the timing of various legal issues. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Types of ownership interest   Implicit in the analysis of the subject property is a determination of the interest in the property being appraised. For most common situations (e.g. -- mortgage finance) the  fee simple  interest is explicitly assumed since it is the most complete bundle of rights available. However, in many situations, and in many societies which do not follow English Common Law or the Napoleanic Code, some other interest may be more common. While there are many different possible interests in real estate, the three most common are:     Fee simple value  (known in the UK as  freehold ) - The most complete ownership in real estate, subject in common law countries to the powers reserved to the state (taxation, escheat, eminent domain, and police power)       Leased fee value  - This is simply the fee simple interest encumbered by a lease. If the lease is at market rent, then the leased fee value and the fee simple value are equal. However, if the tenant pays more or less than market, the residual owned by the leased fee holder, plus the market value of the tenancy, may be more or less than the fee simple value.       Leasehold value  - The interest held by a tenant. If the tenant pays market rent, then the leasehold has no market value. However, if the tenant pays less than market, the difference betweent the present value of what is paid and the present value of market rents would be a positive leasehold value. For example, a major chain retailer may be able to negotiate a below-market lease to serve as the anchor tenant for a shopping center. This leasehold value may be transferrable to another anchor tenant, and if so the retail tenant has a positive interest in the real estate.       [ edit ]   Mass appraisal and automated valuation models   Automated valuation models  (AVMs) are growing in acceptance. These rely on statistical models such as multiple regression analysis or geographic information systems (GIS). [ 8 ]  While AVMs can be quite accurate, particularly when used in a very homogeneous area, there is also evidence that AVMs are not accurate in other instances such as when they are used in rural areas, or when the appraised property does not conform well to the neighborhood. AVM's have also gained favor in class action litigation, and have been substantiated in numerous cases, both in Federal and state courts, as the appropriate method for dealing with large-scale real estate litigation problems, such as contaminated neighborhoods [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Governing authorities and professional organizations     [ edit ]   International   The various US and international professional organizations have started collaborating in recent years towards the development of  International Valuation Standards  which will facilitate global real estate appraisal, a much-needed adjunct to real estate investment portfolios which transcend national boundaries.   The IVSC - The  International Valuation Standards Committee , is a  Non-governmental Organisation (NGO)  member of the  UN , with membership that encompasses all the major national valuation standard-setters and professional associations from 41 different countries (including the  Appraisal Institute , the  RICS  and the  Appraisal Institute of Canada ). IVSC have published the  International Valuation Standards (IVS) , now in their 8th edition.     [ edit ]   Germany   In  Germany , real estate appraisal is known as real estate valuation ( Immobilienbewertung ). Real estate appraisers ( Immobilienbewerter  or  Gutachter ) can qualify to become a  ffentlich bestellter und vereidigter Sachverstndiger  (officially appointed and sworn expert). However, this formerly very important title has lost a lot of its importance over the past years, but still is of some value in court procedures. The title is not generally required for appraisals.   Governing authorities  The real estate appraisal practice in Germany is partly codified by law. The federal  Baugesetzbuch  (abbr. BauGB, ""German statutory code on building and construction'"") contains guidelines on governing authorities, defines the term market value and refers to continuative rules (chapter 3, articles 192 ff.). Each municipality (city or administrative district) has to form a  Gutachterausschuss  (appraisal committee), consisting of a chairman and honorary members  [ 10 ] . The committee gathers information on all real estate deals (it is mandatory to send a copy of each notarial purchase contract to the  Gutachterausschuss ) and includes it in the  Kaufpreissammlung  (purchase price database). Most committees publish an official real estate market report every two years, in which besides other information on comparables the land value is determined. The committees also perform appraisals on behalf of public authorities.   Federal regulations  The BauGB defines the  Verkehrswert  or  Marktwert  (market value, both terms with identical meaning) as follows: ""The market value is determined by the price that can be realised at the date of valuation, in an arm's length transaction, with due regard to the legal situation and the effective characteristics, the nature and lay of the premises or any other subject of the valuation""  [ 11 ]  (non-official translation). The intention, as in other countries, is to include all objective influences and to exclude all influences resulting from the subjective circumstances of the involved parties.   This federal law is supported by the  Wertermittlungsverordnung  (abbr. WertV, ""regulation on the determination of value"")  [ 12 ] . The WertV defines the codified valuation approaches and the general valuation technique. German codified valuation approaches (other apporaches such as DCF or residual approach are also permitted, but not codified) are the:     Vergleichswertverfahren  (sales comparison approach) - used where good evidence of previous sales is available and for owner-occupied assets, especially condominiums and single-family houses;   Ertragswertverfahren  (German income approach) - standard procedure for property that produces future cash flows from the letting of the property;   Sachwertverfahren  (German cost approach) - used for specialised property where none of the above approaches applies, e. g. public buildings.     WertV's general regulations are further supported by the  Wertermittlungsrichtlinie  (abbr. WertR, ""directive on the determination of value"")  [ 13 ] . The WertR provides templates for calculations, tables (e. g. economic depreciation) and guidelines for the consideration of different influences. WertV and WertR are not binding for appraisals for nonofficial use, nonetheless they should be regarded as  best practice  or Generally Accepted (German) Valuation Practice (GAVP).   Comments on German GAVP  In most regards Generally Accepted (German) Valuation Principles is consistent with international practice. The investment market weighs the income approach most heavily. However, there are some important differences:     Land and improvements are treated separately. German GAVP assumes that the land can be used indefinitely, but the buildings have a limited lifespan; This coincides with the balancing of the assets. The value of the land is determined by the sales comparison approach in both the income and cost approaches, using the data accumulated by the  Gutachterausschuss  which is then added to the building value.   In order to account for the usage of the land, the  net operating income  is reduced by the  Liegenschaftszins  (interest paid to the land-owner by the owner of the building, i.e. ground rent). The  Liegenschaftszins  is the product of the land value and the  Liegenschaftszinssatz  (interest rate for land-use). The  Liegenschaftszinssatz  is the equivalent of the yield - with some important differences - and is also determined by the  Gutachterausschuss .   Unlike the All Risks Yield (ARY) in UK practice, the  Liegenschaftszinssatz  (abbr. LZ) does not include an allowance for default (not to be confused with structural vacancy), therefore this needs to be subtracted from  gross operating income . As a result, the  Liegenschaftszinssatz  will usually be lower than the All Risks Yield.   Based on the assumption that the economic life of the improvements is limited, the yield and remaining economic life determine the building value from the net operating income.   It should also be observed that contracts in Germany generally prescribe that the landlord bears a higher portion of maintenance and operating costs than their counterparts in the US and UK.     Criticism  Mathematically the distinction between land and improvements in the income approach will have no impact on the overall value when the remaining economic life is more than thirty years. For this reason it has become quite common to use the  Vereinfachtes Ertragswertverfahren  (simplified income approach), omitting the land value and the  Liegenschaftszins . However, the separate treatment of land and buildings leads to more precise results for older buildings, especially for commercial buildings, which typically have a shorter economic life than residential buildings.   An advantage of the comparatively high degree of standardization practiced by professional appraisers, is the greater ability to check an appraisal for inconsistency, accuracy and transparency.   Professional organisations  The Federal German Organisation of Appointed and Sworn Experts ( Bundesverband Deutscher Sachverstndiger und Fachgutachter , abbr. BDSF) [ 14 ]  is the main professional organisation encompassing the majority of licensed appraisers in Germany. In recent years, with the move towards a more global outlook in the valuation profession, the  RICS  has gained a foothold in Germany, somewhat at the expense of the BDSF.   With special focus on hypothecary value, in 1996, German banks with real estate financing activities formed the  HypZert GmbH [ 15 ] , an association for the certification of real estate valuers. A  HypZert  qualification is regarded as mandatory for their appraisers by many German banks.     [ edit ]   Israel   In  Israel , the real estate appraisal profession is regulated by the Council of Land Valuers, an organ of the Ministry of Justice; the largest professional organisation, encompassing the majority of appraisers/land valuers is the Association of Land Valuers. Valuers must be registered with the Council, which is a statutory body set up by law, and which oversees the training and administers the national professional exams that are a prerequisite for attaining registration. In 2005 the Council set up a Valuation Standards Committee with the purpose of developing and promulgating Standards that would reflect best practice; these have tended to follow a rules-based approach.   Historically, most valuations in Israel were statutory valuations (such as valuations performed for purposes of  Betterment Tax  - a tax administered on any gains accruing to the property by way of changes to the local planning) as well as valuations performed for purposes of bank lending. This is now changing: since the adoption in Israel of  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  (were adopted in 2006; will fully come into effect in 2008), the profession has been additionally engaged in performing valuations for purposes of financial reporting.     [ edit ]   Japan   The  Japanese Association of Real Estate Appraisal , established in 1965, is the only certified association and is regulated by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transportation and Tourism.     [ edit ]   United Kingdom   In the  UK , real estate appraisal is known as  property valuation  and a real estate appraiser is a  land valuer  or  property valuer  (usually a qualified  chartered surveyor  who specialises in property valuation). Property valuation in the UK is regulated by the  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors  (RICS), a professional body encompassing all of the building and property-related professions. The RICS professional guidelines for valuers are published in the  RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards , commonly known as the  Red Book . While based in the UK, RICS is a global organization and has become very active in the US in recent years through its affiliation with the Counselors of Real Estate, a division of the National Association of Realtors.     [ edit ]   United States   Appraisal practice in the US is regulated by the various states. The  Financial Institutions Reform and Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA)  of 1989 demanded all the states to develop systems for licensing and certifying real estate appraisers. [ 16 ]  To accomplish this, the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) was formed, with representatives from the various Federal mortgage regulatory agencies. [ 17 ]  Thus, currently all the  real estate  appraisers must be state-licensed and certified. But prior to the 1990s, there were no commonly accepted standards either for appraisal quality or for appraiser licensure. In the 1980s, an ad-hoc committee representing various appraisal professional organizations in the U.S. and Canada met to codify the best practices into what became known as the  Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) . The  Savings and Loan Crisis  in the U.S. resulted in increased Federal regulation of the mortgage lending process via the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1991. A portion of this act required federal lending regulators to adopt appraisal standards. A not-for-profit organization, the  Appraisal Foundation  (TAF), was formed by the same organizations which had developed USPAP, and the copyright for USPAP was signed over to TAF. Federal oversight of TAF is provided by the Appraisal Subcommittee, made up of representatives of various Federal lending regulators. TAF carries out its work through two boards: the Appraisal Standards Board promulgates and updates USPAP; the Appraisal Qualifications Board (AQB) promulgates minimum recommended standards for appraiser certification and licensure. During the 1990s, all of the states adopted USPAP as the governing standards within their states and developed licensure standards which met or exceeded the recommendations of TAF. Also, the various state and federal courts have adopted USPAP for real estate litigation and all of the federally lending regulators adopt USPAP for mortgage finance appraisal. [ 17 ]   In addition, there are professional appraisal organizations, organized as private not-for-profits, which date to the  Great Depression  of the 1930s. One of the oldest in the U.S. is the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers (ASFMRA), founded in 1929. [ 18 ]  Others were founded as needed and opportunity arose in specialized fields, such as the Appraisal Institute (AI) and the American Society of Appraisers (ASA) founded in the 1930s, the International Right of Way Association and the National Association of Realtors which were founded after World War II. These organizations all existed to establish and enforce standards, but their influence has waned as the government increases appraisal regulation. In March 2007, three of these organizations (ASFMRA, ASA, and AI) announced an agreement in principle to merge. NAIFA (National Association of Independent Fee Appraisers), a charter member of The Appraisal Foundation, helped to write Title XI, the Real Estate Appraisal Reform Amendments. It was founded in 1961.   The best known professional organization of real estate appraisers in America is the  Appraisal Institute . It was formed in from the merger of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers and the Society of Real Estate Appraisers. Founded along with others in the 1930s, the two organizations merged in the 1990s to form the  Appraisal Institute  (AI). This group awards two professional designations:  SRA , to residential appraisers, and  MAI , to commercial appraisers. The Institute has enacted rigorous regulations regarding to the use and display of these designations. For example, contrary to popular belief, ""MAI"" does  not  stand for ""Member, Appraisal Institute"". According to the institute, the letters ""do not represent specific words"", and an MAI may not use the words ""Member, Appraisal Institute"" in lieu of the MAI mark. The primary motive for this rule is to prevent dilution of the trademark.   Other leading appraisal organizations include the  American Society of Appraisers ,  National Association of Independent Fee Appraisers , and the  National Association of Master Appraisers , which were also founding sponsor-members of the Appraisal Foundation. [ 19 ]  The  Massachusetts Board of Real Estate Appraisers  (MBREA), founded in 1934, is the only state appraisal association that has been named a sponsor of the Appraisal Foundation.  [ 20 ]  In recent years, the  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)  has become highly regarded in the US, and has formed a collaboration with the Counselors of Real Estate, a division of the  National Association of Realtors . RICS, which is headquartered in London, operates on a global scale and awards the designations  MRICS  and  FRICS  to Members and Fellows of RICS. The  Real Estate Counseling Group of America  is a small group of the top appraisers and real estate analysts in the US who collectively have authored a disproportionately large body of appraisal methodology.

Does the property appraiser levy or collect taxes?   How is property appraised?     What is market value?   Can I get a tax exemption?     Besides Homestead, what other exemptions are available under law?    When will I know the amount of my tax bill?    What if I think the appraised value of my property is too high?     What is an ""AG"" classification?       What does the property appraiser do?   The property appraiser is responsible for identifying, locating, and fairly valuing all property, both real and personal, within the county for tax purposes. The ""market"" value of real property is based on the current real estate market. Estimating the ""market"" value of your property means discovering the price most people would pay for your property in its current condition.   What is important to remember is that the property appraiser does not create the value. People establish the value by buying and selling real estate in the market place. The property appraiser has the legal responsibility to study those transactions and appraise your property accordingly.  The property appraiser also    tracks ownership changes;   maintains maps of parcel boundaries;   keeps descriptions of buildings and property characteristics up to date;   accepts and approves applications from individuals eligible for exemptions and other forms of property tax relief;   and most importantly, analyzes trends in sales prices, construction costs, and rents to best estimate the value of all assessable property.      Does the property appraiser levy or collect taxes?   No. The property appraiser assesses all property in the county and is neither a taxing authority nor a tax collector. The property appraiser has nothing to do with the amount of taxes levied or collected.    Three separate government entities each having unique and distinct roles in producing your November tax bill. First, the property appraiser annually appraises all property in your county at the market value as of January 1. Next, each taxing authority within the county sets their own millage rate based on the amount of tax dollars necessary to fund their annual budget. Finally, the tax collector takes the amount of taxes due in order to bill and collect all taxes levied within the county.      How is property appraised?   At least once every three years, the property appraiser or a staff appraiser will visit and inspect each property. However, individual property values may be adjusted between visits in light of sales activity or other factors affecting real estate values in your neighborhood. Sales of similar properties are strong indicators of value in the real estate market.   To estimate the value of a property, the property appraiser must identify the properties that have sold, their sale prices and the terms and conditions of the each sale. Each transaction must be studied to make sure that it is an arms-length transaction.    An arm's length transaction is a sale involving a willing seller and a willing buyer without any undue pressure or special incentives (such as family relationships). An arm's length transaction also means that the property was on the market for neither an excessive nor short period of time.    Once this is determined, the property appraiser can base the value of a property on sales of comparable properties. That is why property appraisers maintain an accurate data base of real estate information, and this is the sale comparison approach to value.   The Florida Constitution has been amended effective January 1, 1995 to limit any annual increase in the assessed value of residential property with a homestead exemption to 3 percent  or  the rate of inflation, whichever is lower. This limitation does not include any change, addition or improvement to a homestead (excluding normal maintenance or substantially equivalent replacement). During subsequent years, any improvements will fall under the Constitutional limitation.   Two other methods are used to appraise property - the cost approach and the income approach. The cost approach is based on how much it would cost today to build an almost identical structure on the parcel. If your property is not new, the appraiser must also determine how much the building has lost value over time. The appraiser must also determine the value of the land itself - without buildings or any improvements.  The income approach (usually performed on commercial property) requires a study of how much revenue your property would produce if it were rented as an apartment house, a store, an office building and so on. The appraiser must consider operating expenses, taxes, insurance, maintenance costs, and the return or profit most people would expect on the type of property you own.      What is market value?   Florida Law requires that the just value of all property be determined each year. The Supreme Court of Florida has declared ""just value"" to be legally synonymous to ""full cash value"" and ""fair market value."" The fair market value of your property is the amount for which it could sell on the open market. The property appraiser analyzes these market transactions annually to determine fair market value as of January 1.     Can I get a tax exemption?   In addition to determining values, the property appraiser accepts applications for and administers property tax exemptions. Several types of exemptions are available.    The type of exemption benefiting the largest number of property owners is the HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION. If you own property which you use as your primary residence as of January 1, you may apply for homestead exemption. This will reduce the taxable value of your home by $25,000, resulting in substantial savings on your property taxes.   Any new exemption or change in exemption status should be filed as soon as possible, but no later than March 1.     Besides Homestead, what other exemptions are available under law?    Widow/ Widowers Exemption ($500)-    To file for Widow or Widower's Exemption you must be a widow or widower prior to January 1st of the tax year and bring proof of your spouse's death. (Divorced persons do not qualify for this exemption.)    Disability Exemption ($500)-   In addition to proof of Florida residency, you must provide one of the following:    Proof of total and permanent disability from two [2] professional unrelated licensed Florida physicians, the U.S. Veteran's Administration;   Proof of 10% or more war-time disability from Veteran's Administration;   Present proof of legal blindness.    Total exemption from ad valorem taxation on homestead property for totally and permanently disabled-   Section 196.101, F.S., provides that property owners qualifying for the homestead exemption on January 1, who are quadriplegic, paraplegic, hemiplegic, or other totally and permanently disabled persons, who must use a wheel chair for mobility, or are legally blind and produce certification of that fact from two [2] professionally unrelated licensed Florida physicians, or the U.S. Veteran's Administration, shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation. Except for quadriplegics & Veterans, there is also a gross income limitation for this exemption, governing all persons residing upon the homestead, which is adjusted annually.   Section 196.081, F.S. , provides that property owners qualifying for the homestead exemption on January 1, who are veterans honorably discharged with a service connected total and permanent disability, shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation. Confirmation of the disability from the U.S. Veteran's Administration is required for this exemption. A surviving spouse could enjoy the benefit of this exemption if the veteran was a permanent resident of Florida on January 1 of the year he or she died.      When will I know the amount of my tax bill?   Each August, the property appraiser sends a Truth in Millage (TRIM) notice to all property owners as required by law. This notice is very important -- look for it in the mail! You'll recognize it by prominent lettering, ""DO NOT PAY - This is not a bill.""   The TRIM notice tells you the taxable value of your property. Taxable value is the just value less any exemptions.   The TRIM notice also gives you information on proposed millage rates and taxes as estimated by your community taxing authorities. It also tells you when and where these authorities will hold public meetings to discuss tentative budgets to set your millage tax rates.   Fees not related to your property value may also appear on your TRIM notice for garbage collection, roads, lighting and other government services. These fees are set by your taxing authority and are not affected by any change in the value of your house or property.     What if I think the appraised value of my property is too high?   If you think the taxable value shown on your TRIM Notice is not correct, you are encouraged to contact your property appraiser's office to speak with an appraiser. The appraiser can show you the information used to determine your property's value.      What is an ""AG"" classification?   An agricultural classification is the designation of land by the property appraiser, pursuant to F.S. 193.461, in which the assessment is based on agricultural use value.    To qualify for Agricultural classification, a return must be filed with the property appraiser between January 1 and March 1 of the tax year. Only lands which are used for bona fide agricultural purposes shall be classified agricultural.    ""Bona fide agricultural purposes"" means good faith commercial agricultural use of the land. The property appraiser, prior to classifying such lands, may require the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative to furnish such information as may reasonably be required to establish such lands are actually used for a bona fide agricultural purpose.   The property appraiser may deny agricultural classification to the following lands:    Lands which are not being used for or diverted from agricultural use;   Land that has been zoned non-agricultural at the request of the owner;   Land on which a sub-division plat is recorded;   Land which is purchased for a price three or more times the agricultural appraisal placed on the land.    Back to top         Homestead Exemption Information    What do I need to do?    Where can I file?    What information do I need to bring with me?    When do I apply?   Do I have to be a citizen to qualify?    What if the property is in trust?   Can I get homestead exemption on a mobile home?    Is there any appeal if I miss the deadline for filing?       What do I need to do?    All persons seeking homestead exemption must complete an original application (Form DR-501). The application must be signed and filed in person.       Where can I file?   You can file at the property appraiser's office.     What information do I need to bring with me?    A recorded deed or tax bill in your name.   Social Security numbers for all owners.  The following information to establish proof of residency for all owners who occupy the property must be presented in-person at our office:    Florida driver's license, if you drive or if a non-driver, a declaration of domicile recorded prior to January 1;   Florida auto tag registration, if you drive   Florida voter registration card, if you are registered to vote.   If you do not possess these items, please call the property appraiser for further information.      When do I apply?   The normal filing time for homestead exemption begins on January 1 and lasts through March 1. All exemption applications for that year must be filed by March 1. You may pre-file for the following year from March 2 through December 31.    Failure to apply on or before March 1, according to law, is a waiver of the exemption privilege for that year.      Do I have to be a citizen to qualify?   Citizenship is not required to file for homestead exemption. An applicant who is not a U.S. citizen must present a resident alien card (green card) when they apply.      What if the property is in trust?   In these cases, it is necessary for the applicant to furnish this office with a copy of the trust agreement. Florida law specifies those situations under which the resident may obtain homestead exemption.   The Florida Constitution requires that the homestead claimant have legal title or beneficial title in equity to the property.     Can I get homestead exemption on a mobile home?   Yes, you may if you own the land on which the mobile home is located. When applying, you must bring in the title or registration to the mobile home.      Is there any appeal if I miss the deadline for filing?   Yes. You must file an appeal with the Value Adjustment Board and a late application for homestead exemption at the property appraiser's office in person. The deadline for filing is set by law -- on or before the 25th day following the mailing of the notice of proposed property taxes (T.R.I.M. notice). This date usually falls in early September. You may call your property appraiser's office to confirm the deadline date.    Approval or denial of the late application is determined by the Value Adjustment Board. This panel will hear your reasons for not filing in a timely manner and make a determination whether or not your application can be approved for that tax year.    Back to top            Amendment 10 ""Save Our Homes"" Value Cap    WHAT is the Save Our Homes amendment?   HOW does the amendment limitation apply?   HOW is my property affected?   WHAT about any changes, additions or improvements to the homestead property?   WHAT properties are not subject to the limitation?    WHAT happens if a property is sold or conveyed to a new owner?       What is the Save Our Homes amendment?   Section 193.155(1) of the Florida Statutes was enacted to implement an amendment to the state constitution to limit annual increases in property value assessments on real property qualifying for and receiving homestead exemption.      How does the amendment limitation apply?    Real property shall be assessed at full market value (just value) as of January 1 of the year in which the property first receives the homestead exemption. The following year the property is reassessed and any changes from the prior year's assessed value is not to exceed the lesser of 3% of that prior year assessed value  or  the Consumer Price Index percentage change, (except capital improvements, additions or improvements).      How is my property affected?   The year following the granting of homestead exemption, the property is subject to the limitation.      What about any changes, additions or improvements to the homestead property?   New construction or additions shall be assessed at full market value as of the first January 1 after the changes are substantially completed. In these circumstances, it is possible that the assessed value may exceed the amendment limitations. However; after the first year that the changes are assessed at full market value, they are also subject to the amendment limitations.      What properties are not subject to the limitation?   Residences without homestead, non-residential property, vacant land, tangible personal property, commercial property, and agricultural property are not eligible for the amendment limitation.      Why would my assessment increase when my market value stayed the same?   This is probably due to the ""recapture"" rule. In 1995, the Department of Revenue adopted a rule, approved by the Governor and Cabinet, directing property appraisers to raise the assessed value of a qualifying homestead property by the maximum of 3% or the Consumer Price Index, whichever is less, on all properties assessed at less than full market value (just value).    What happens if a property is sold or conveyed to a new owner?   Once the property has been conveyed to the new owner (and the homestead exemption is interrupted), it is raised to full market value (just value) January 1 of the following year. The new owner must qualify and apply to receive homestead exemption. Even if the property received a homestead exemption under the previous owner, the limitation, just like the exemption, expires January 1 of the year following a change of ownership.     Back to top              Tangible Personal Property    What is ""tangible personal property""?   Who must file a personal property return?   Why do I have to file?   If I am no longer in business, should I still file?    What if I have old equipment that has been fully depreciated and written off the books?    Important Dates To Remember    Do I have to report assets that I lease, loan, rent, borrow or are provided as part of the rent?    Is there a minimum value that I do not have to report?    What are the deadlines and penalties for filing?    If I buy or sell an existing business during the year, who is responsible for the taxes?   What is an ""office"" or ""field review"" assessment?    What if I don't agree with the assessed value that appears on my notice of proposed property tax?    Helpful Hints And Suggestions       What is ""tangible personal property""?   Tangible personal property (TPP) is defined in Section 192.001, F.S. as ""all goods, chattels and other articles of value (but does not include...vehicular items...) capable of manual possession and whose chief value is intrinsic to the article itself."" TPP is everything other than real estate that has value by itself and includes such things as furniture, fixtures, tools, machinery, household appliances, signs, equipment, leasehold improvements, supplies, leased equipment and any other equipment used in a business or to earn income. It does not include motor vehicles, mobile homes, inventory, livestock, boats or airplanes.     Who must file a personal property return?   Anyone in possession of assets on January 1 who has either a proprietorship, partnership, corporation or is a self-employed agent or contractor, must file each year. Property owners who lease, lend or rent property must also file a return.     Why do I have to file?   Section 193.052, Florida Statutes, requires that all tangible personal property be reported each year to the Property Appraiser's office. Failure to submit receive a personal property tax return the property appraiser does not relieve you of your obligation to file.      What If I have no assets to report?   Even if you feel you have nothing to report, complete the return form, attach an explanation about why nothing was reported, and file it with the property appraiser's office. Almost all businesses and rental units have some assets to report, even if it is only supplies, rented equipment, or household goods.     If I am no longer in business, should I still file?    Yes. If you were in business on January 1 of the tax year, indicate the date you went out of business, the manner in which you disposed of your business assets and the name and address of the recipient of the assets on your return. If you still have the assets, you must file on these items. Sign and date the return and file it with the property appraiser's office.         What if I have old equipment that has been fully depreciated and written off the books?   Whether fully depreciated in your accounting records or not, all property still in use or in your possession should be reported.     Important Dates To Remember     January 1   Date of assessment   Personal property returns due to property appraiser   January 1 to March 1   Widow, widower and disability applications taken for tangible mobile home improvements (You must reside on the property as of January 1 of the tax year to qualify!)    April 1   Filing deadline for personal property returns to avoid penalties    August   Notices of proposed property tax mailed (also called ""TRIM"" or Truth in Millage)   September   Deadline to file Value Adjustment Board petition    November   Tax bills sent by the County Finance Department.       Do I have to report assets that I lease, loan, rent, borrow or are provided as part of the rent?   Yes. There is an area on the return specifically for those assets. Even though the assets are assessed to the owner, they must be listed for informational purposes.     Is there a minimum value that I do not have to report?   No. There is no minimum value. A personal property tax return must be filed on all assets by April 1. However, if the resulting property taxes amount to less than $5.00, you will not receive a tax bill.     What are the deadlines and penalties for filing?   The deadline for filing a timely return is April 1. After that date, state law provides that penalties be applied at 5% per month or portion of a month that the return is late., up to a maximum of 25% penalty when no return is filed.     If I buy or sell an existing business during the year, who is responsible for the taxes?   The new owner is responsible. However, if there is insufficient property to satisfy the taxes due, on January 1 the new owner will be responsible for the difference. Most title companies do not do a search of the tangible assets of a business, therefore, you should consult your broker, attorney or closing agent to insure your proper protection.     What is an office or field review assessment?   When a tax return is not filed by April 1, the property appraiser is required to place an assessment on the property. This assessment represents an estimate based upon the value of businesses with similar equipment and assets. Being assessed does not alleviate you of your responsibility to file an accurate return.     What if I don't agree with the assessed value that appears on my notice of proposed property tax?   In mid-August, the owner of record will receive a notice of proposed property tax covering TPP. If you disagree with your assessment, call your property appraiser or go to the office to discuss the matter. If you have evidence that the appraised value is more than the actual fair market value of your property, the property appraiser will welcome the opportunity to review all the pertinent facts. If you do not agree after talking, then you may file a petition to have the matter reviewed by the Value Adjustment Board, an independent reviewing authority. Should you not agree with the VAB, then you may file suit to have the assessment reviewed in court.      Helpful Hints And Suggestions    File the original return from this office as soon as possible before April 1. Be sure to sign and date your return.   Work with your accountant or C.P.A. to identify any equipment that may have been ""physically removed."" List those items in the appropriate space on your return.   If you have an asset listing or depreciation schedule that identifies each item of equipment, attach it to the completed return.   Do not use vague terms such as ""various"" or ""same as last year.""   It is to your advantage to provide a breakdown of assets since depreciation on each item may vary.   Please include your estimate of fair market value and the original cost of the item on your return. These are important considerations in determining an accurate assessment.   Look for additional information concerning filing within the instructional section of the return itself.   If you sell your business, go out of business, or move to a new location, please inform your property appraiser office promptly. This helps to ensure timely, accurate records.

In the  common law  systems personal property may also be called  chattels  or  personalty . It is distinguished from  real property , or  real estate . In the  civil law  systems personal property is often called  movable property  or  movables  - any property that can be moved from one location to another. This term is in distinction with  immovable property  or immovables, such as land and buildings.   Historically,  slaves  have often been legally treated as personal property. In some cultures, servants, wives and children have also been considered to greater or lesser degrees to be the personal property ( chattel ) of their husbands, fathers or guardians. For example, in Biblical times, the ancient Hebrews were permitted to sell their daughters into servitude, and servants could be bought or sold as slaves were - although Hebrew servants could not be legally sold to aliens, and male Hebrew servants were set free after serving for 7 years. (see Exodus 20 for details). Even in Victorian times, children could be bought and sold - as chronicled in  Charles Dickens 's novel  Oliver Twist .   Personal property may be classified in a variety of ways.  Tangible personal property  refers to any type of property that can generally be moved (i.e., it is not attached to real property or land), touched or felt. These generally include items such as furniture, clothing, jewelry, art, writings, or household goods. In some cases, there can be formal title documents that show the ownership and transfer rights of that property after a person's death (for example, motor vehicles, boats, etc.) In many cases, however, tangible personal property will not be ""titled"" in an owner's name and is presumed to be whatever property he or she was in possession of at the time of his or her death.   Intangible personal property  or ""intangibles"" refers to personal property that cannot be actually ""moved"" touched or felt, but instead represents something of value such as  negotiable instruments ,  securities ,  goods , and  intangible assets  including  chose in action .   Accountants also distinguish personal property from real property because personal property can be  depreciated  faster than improvements (while land is not depreciable at all). It is an owner's right to get tax benefits for chattel, and there are businesses that specialize in appraising personal property, or chattel.   The distinction between these types of property is significant for a variety of reasons. Usually one's rights on movables are more attenuated than one's rights on immovables (or real property). The  statutes of limitations  or  prescriptive periods  are usually shorter when dealing with personal or movable property. Real property rights are usually enforceable for a much longer period of time and in most jurisdictions real estate and immovables are registered in government-sanctioned land registers. In some jurisdictions, rights (such as a  lien  or other security interest) can be registered against personal or movable property.   In the common law it is possible to place a  mortgage  upon real property. Such mortgage requires payment or the owner of the mortgage can seek  foreclosure . Personal property can often be secured with similar kind of device, variously called a  chattel mortgage , trust receipt, or  security interest . In the United States, Article 9 of the  Uniform Commercial Code  governs the creation and enforcement of security interests in most (but not all) types of personal property.   There is no similar institution to the mortgage in the civil law, however a  hypothec  is a device to secure  real rights  against property. These real rights follow the property along with the ownership. In the common law a lien also remains on the property and it is not extinguished by alienation of the property; liens may be real or  equitable .   Many jurisdictions levy a personal  property tax , an annual tax on the privilege of owning or possessing personal property within the boundaries of the jurisdiction. Automobile and boat registration fees are a subset of this tax. Most household goods are exempt as long as they are kept or used within the household; the tax usually becomes a problem when the taxing authority discovers that expensive personal property like art is being regularly stored outside of the household.     [ edit ]   Personal vs Private property   In political/economic theory, notably  anarchism ,  communism  and some  socialist  philosophies, the distinction between private and personal property is extremely important. They are separated by a blurry boundary, which items of property constitute which is open to debate.     Personal property  is part of your person and includes property from which you have the right to exclude others (e.g TVs, cars, clothes etc). [ 1 ]       Private property  is a  social relationship , not a relationship between person and thing according to  Marx  (e.g factories, mines, dams, infrastructure etc). In  capitalism  there is no distinction between personal and private property. [ 2 ]       To many socialists, the term  private property  refers to capital or the means of production, while personal property refers to consumer and non-capital goods and services.

clueweb09-en0010-41-09999	"   Frequently Asked Questions       These are examples of questions frequently asked. There are many individual circumstances which can impact upon the appraisal and filing process. The Property Appraiser welcomes your inquiries. This office is here to serve you and all residents of Calhoun County to ensure fair and equitable appraisal of property.      Appraisal Questions      Homestead Exemption      Amendment 10 (Save Our Homes)      Tangible Personal Property                       Appraisal Questions   What does the property appraiser do?   Does the property appraiser levy or collect taxes?   How is property appraised?   What is market value?   Can I get a tax exemption?   Besides Homestead, what other exemptions are available under law?   When will I know the amount of my tax bill?   What if I think the appraised value of my property is too high?   What is an ""AG"" classification?      What does the property appraiser do?  The property appraiser is responsible for identifying, locating, and fairly valuing all property, both real and personal, within the county for tax purposes. The ""market"" value of real property is based on the current real estate market. Estimating the ""market"" value of your property means discovering the price most people would pay for your property in its current condition. What is important to remember is that the property appraiser does not create the value. People establish the value by buying and selling real estate in the market place. The property appraiser has the legal responsibility to study those transactions and appraise your property accordingly. The property appraiser also      tracks ownership changes;     maintains maps of parcel boundaries;     keeps descriptions of buildings and property characteristics up to date;     accepts and approves applications from individuals eligible for exemptions and other forms of property tax relief;     and most importantly, analyzes trends in sales prices, construction costs, and rents to best estimate the value of all assessable property.        Does the property appraiser levy or collect taxes?  No. The property appraiser assesses all property in the county and is neither a taxing authority nor a tax collector. The property appraiser has nothing to do with the amount of taxes levied or collected.  Three separate government entities each having unique and distinct roles in producing your November tax bill. First, the property appraiser annually appraises all property in your county at the market value as of January 1. Next, each taxing authority within the county sets their own millage rate based on the amount of tax dollars necessary to fund their annual budget. Finally, the tax collector takes the amount of taxes due in order to bill and collect all taxes levied within the county.     How is property appraised?  At least once every three years, the property appraiser or a staff appraiser will visit and inspect each property. However, individual property values may be adjusted between visits in light of sales activity or other factors affecting real estate values in your neighborhood. Sales of similar properties are strong indicators of value in the real estate market.   To estimate the value of a property, the property appraiser must identify the properties that have sold, their sale prices and the terms and conditions of the each sale. Each transaction must be studied to make sure that it is an arms-length transaction.  An arm's length transaction is a sale involving a willing seller and a willing buyer without any undue pressure or special incentives (such as family relationships). An arm's length transaction also means that the property was on the market for neither an excessive nor short period of time.  Once this is determined, the property appraiser can base the value of a property on sales of comparable properties. That is why property appraisers maintain an accurate data base of real estate information, and this is the sale comparison approach to value.   The Florida Constitution has been amended effective January 1, 1995 to limit any annual increase in the assessed value of residential property with a homestead exemption to 3 percent  or  the rate of inflation, whichever is lower. This limitation does not include any change, addition or improvement to a homestead (excluding normal maintenance or substantially equivalent replacement). During subsequent years, any improvements will fall under the Constitutional limitation.   Two other methods are used to appraise property - the cost approach and the income approach. The cost approach is based on how much it would cost today to build an almost identical structure on the parcel. If your property is not new, the appraiser must also determine how much the building has lost value over time. The appraiser must also determine the value of the land itself - without buildings or any improvements. The income approach (usually performed on commercial property) requires a study of how much revenue your property would produce if it were rented as an apartment house, a store, an office building and so on. The appraiser must consider operating expenses, taxes, insurance, maintenance costs, and the return or profit most people would expect on the type of property you own.     What is market value?  Florida Law requires that the just value of all property be determined each year. The Supreme Court of Florida has declared ""just value"" to be legally synonymous to ""full cash value"" and ""fair market value."" The fair market value of your property is the amount for which it could sell on the open market. The property appraiser analyzes these market transactions annually to determine fair market value as of January 1.     Can I get a tax exemption?  In addition to determining values, the property appraiser accepts applications for and administers property tax exemptions. Several types of exemptions are available.  The type of exemption benefiting the largest number of property owners is the HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION. If you own property which you use as your primary residence as of January 1, you may apply for homestead exemption. This will reduce the taxable value of your home by $25,000, resulting in substantial savings on your property taxes.   Any new exemption or change in exemption status should be filed as soon as possible, but no later than March 1.     Besides Homestead, what other exemptions are available under law?       Widow/ Widowers Exemption ($500)-     To file for Widow or Widower's Exemption you must be a widow or widower prior to January 1st of the tax year and bring proof of your spouse's death. (Divorced persons do not qualify for this exemption.)         Disability Exemption ($500)-           In addition to proof of Florida residency, you must provide one of the following:      Proof of total and permanent disability from two [2] professional unrelated licensed Florida physicians, the U.S. Veteran's Administration;     Proof of 10% or more war-time disability from Veteran's Administration;     Present proof of legal blindness.       Total exemption from ad valorem taxation on homestead property for totally and permanently disabled-     Section 196.101, F.S., provides that property owners qualifying for the homestead exemption on January 1, who are quadriplegic, paraplegic, hemiplegic, or other totally and permanently disabled persons, who must use a wheel chair for mobility, or are legally blind and produce certification of that fact from two [2] professionally unrelated licensed Florida physicians, or the U.S. Veteran's Administration, shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation. Except for quadriplegics & Veterans, there is also a gross income limitation for this exemption, governing all persons residing upon the homestead, which is adjusted annually.   Section 196.081, F.S. , provides that property owners qualifying for the homestead exemption on January 1, who are veterans honorably discharged with a service connected total and permanent disability, shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation. Confirmation of the disability from the U.S. Veteran's Administration is required for this exemption. A surviving spouse could enjoy the benefit of this exemption if the veteran was a permanent resident of Florida on January 1 of the year he or she died.      When will I know the amount of my tax bill?  Each August, the property appraiser sends a Truth in Millage (TRIM) notice to all property owners as required by law. This notice is very important -- look for it in the mail! You'll recognize it by prominent lettering, ""DO NOT PAY - This is not a bill.""   The TRIM notice tells you the taxable value of your property. Taxable value is the just value less any exemptions.   The TRIM notice also gives you information on proposed millage rates and taxes as estimated by your community taxing authorities. It also tells you when and where these authorities will hold public meetings to discuss tentative budgets to set your millage tax rates.   Fees not related to your property value may also appear on your TRIM notice for garbage collection, roads, lighting and other government services. These fees are set by your taxing authority and are not affected by any change in the value of your house or property.     What if I think the appraised value of my property is too high?  If you think the taxable value shown on your TRIM Notice is not correct, you are encouraged to contact your property appraiser's office to speak with an appraiser. The appraiser can show you the information used to determine your property's value.     What is an ""AG"" classification?  An agricultural classification is the designation of land by the property appraiser, pursuant to F.S. 193.461, in which the assessment is based on agricultural use value.  To qualify for Agricultural classification, a return must be filed with the property appraiser between January 1 and March 1 of the tax year. Only lands which are used for bona fide agricultural purposes shall be classified agricultural.  ""Bona fide agricultural purposes"" means good faith commercial agricultural use of the land. The property appraiser, prior to classifying such lands, may require the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative to furnish such information as may reasonably be required to establish such lands are actually used for a bona fide agricultural purpose.   The property appraiser may deny agricultural classification to the following lands:     Lands which are not being used for or diverted from agricultural use;     Land that has been zoned non-agricultural at the request of the owner;     Land on which a sub-division plat is recorded;     Land which is purchased for a price three or more times the agricultural appraisal placed on the land.     Back to top      Homestead Exemption Information   What do I need to do?   Where can I file?   What information do I need to bring with me?   When do I apply?   Do I have to be a citizen to qualify?   What if the property is in trust?   Can I get homestead exemption on a mobile home?   Is there any appeal if I miss the deadline for filing?      What do I need to do?  All persons seeking homestead exemption must complete an original application (Form DR-501). The application must be signed and filed in person.     Where can I file?  You can file at the property appraiser's office.     What information do I need to bring with me?       A recorded deed or tax bill in your name.     Social Security numbers for all owners.    The following information to establish proof of residency for all owners who occupy the property must be presented in-person at our office:      Florida driver's license, if you drive or if a non-driver, a declaration of domicile recorded prior to January 1;     Florida auto tag registration, if you drive     Florida voter registration card, if you are registered to vote.                                                          If you do not possess these items, please call the property appraiser for further information.     When do I apply?  The normal filing time for homestead exemption begins on January 1 and lasts through March 1. All exemption applications for that year must be filed by March 1.  Failure to apply on or before March 1, according to law, is a waiver of the exemption privilege for that year.     Do I have to be a citizen to qualify?  Citizenship is not required to file for homestead exemption. An applicant who is not a U.S. citizen must present a resident alien card (green card) when they apply.     What if the property is in trust?  In these cases, it is necessary for the applicant to furnish this office with a copy of the trust agreement. Florida law specifies those situations under which the resident may obtain homestead exemption. The Florida Constitution requires that the homestead claimant have legal title or beneficial title in equity to the property.     Can I get homestead exemption on a mobile home?  Yes, you may if you own the land on which the mobile home is located. When applying, you must bring in the title or registration to the mobile home.     Is there any appeal if I miss the deadline for filing?  Yes. You must file an appeal with the Value Adjustment Board and a late application for homestead exemption at the property appraiser's office in person*. The deadline for filing is set by law -- on or before the 25th day following the mailing of the notice of proposed property taxes (T.R.I.M. notice). This date usually falls in early September. You may call your property appraiser's office to confirm the deadline date.  Approval or denial of the late application is determined by the Value Adjustment Board. This panel will hear your reasons for not filing in a timely manner and make a determination whether or not your application can be approved for that tax year.  *There is a filing fee associated with the appeal.    Back to top      Amendment 10 ""Save Our Homes"" Value Cap   WHAT is the Save Our Homes amendment?   HOW does the amendment limitation apply?   HOW is my property affected?   WHAT about any changes, additions or improvements to the homestead property?   WHAT properties are not subject to the limitation?   WHAT happens if a property is sold or conveyed to a new owner?      What is the Save Our Homes amendment?  Section 193.155(1) of the Florida Statutes was enacted to implement an amendment to the state constitution to limit annual increases in property value assessments on real property qualifying for and receiving homestead exemption.     How does the amendment limitation apply?  Real property shall be assessed at full market value (just value) as of January 1 of the year in which the property first receives the homestead exemption. The following year the property is reassessed and any changes from the prior year's assessed value is not to exceed the lesser of 3% of that prior year assessed value  or  the Consumer Price Index percentage change, (except capital improvements, additions or improvements).     How is my property affected?  The year following the granting of homestead exemption, the property is subject to the limitation.     What about any changes, additions or improvements to the homestead property?  New construction or additions shall be assessed at full market value as of the first January 1 after the changes are substantially completed. In these circumstances, it is possible that the assessed value may exceed the amendment limitations. However; after the first year that the changes are assessed at full market value, they are also subject to the amendment limitations.     What properties are not subject to the limitation?  Residences without homestead, non-residential property, vacant land, tangible personal property, commercial property, and agricultural property are not eligible for the amendment limitation.     Why would my assessment increase when my market value stayed the same?  This is probably due to the ""recapture"" rule. In 1995, the Department of Revenue adopted a rule, approved by the Governor and Cabinet, directing property appraisers to raise the assessed value of a qualifying homestead property by the maximum of 3% or the Consumer Price Index, whichever is less, on all properties assessed at less than full market value (just value).   What happens if a property is sold or conveyed to a new owner?  Once the property has been conveyed to the new owner (and the homestead exemption is interrupted), it is raised to full market value (just value) January 1 of the following year. The new owner must qualify and apply to receive homestead exemption. Even if the property received a homestead exemption under the previous owner, the limitation, just like the exemption, expires January 1 of the year following a change of ownership.  Back to top      Tangible Personal Property   What is ""tangible personal property""?   Who must file a personal property return?   Why do I have to file?   If I am no longer in business, should I still file?   What if I have old equipment that has been fully depreciated and written off the books?   Important Dates To Remember   Do I have to report assets that I lease, loan, rent, borrow or are provided as part of the rent?   Is there a minimum value that I do not have to report?   What are the deadlines and penalties for filing?   If I buy or sell an existing business during the year, who is responsible for the taxes?   What is an ""office"" or ""field review"" assessment?   What if I don't agree with the assessed value that appears on my notice of proposed property tax?   Helpful Hints And Suggestions      What is ""tangible personal property""?  Tangible personal property (TPP) is defined in Section 192.001, F.S. as ""all goods, chattels and other articles of value (but does not include...vehicular items...) capable of manual possession and whose chief value is intrinsic to the article itself."" TPP is everything other than real estate that has value by itself and includes such things as furniture, fixtures, tools, machinery, household appliances, signs, equipment, leasehold improvements, supplies, leased equipment and any other equipment used in a business or to earn income. It does not include motor vehicles, mobile homes, inventory, livestock, boats or airplanes.     Who must file a personal property return?  Anyone in possession of assets on January 1 who has either a proprietorship, partnership, corporation or is a self-employed agent or contractor, must file each year. Property owners who lease, lend or rent property must also file a return.     Why do I have to file?  Section 193.052, Florida Statutes, requires that all tangible personal property be reported each year to the Property Appraiser's office.

Almost all businesses and rental units have some assets to report, even if it is only supplies, rented equipment, or household goods.     If I am no longer in business, should I still file?  Yes. If you were in business on January 1 of the tax year, indicate the date you went out of business, the manner in which you disposed of your business assets and the name and address of the recipient of the assets on your return. If you still have the assets, you must file on these items. Sign and date the return and file it with the property appraiser's office.     What if I have old equipment that has been fully depreciated and written off the books?  Whether fully depreciated in your accounting records or not, all property still in use or in your possession should be reported.     Important Dates To Remember   January 1       Date of assessment     Personal property returns due to property appraiser     January 1 to March 1       Widow, widower and disability applications taken for tangible mobile home improvements (You must reside on the property as of January 1 of the tax year to qualify!)

After that date, state law provides that penalties be applied at 5% per month or portion of a month that the return is late., up to a maximum of 25% penalty when no return is filed.     If I buy or sell an existing business during the year, who is responsible for the taxes?  The new owner is responsible. However, if there is insufficient property to satisfy the taxes due, on January 1 the new owner will be responsible for the difference. Most title companies do not do a search of the tangible assets of a business, therefore, you should consult your broker, attorney or closing agent to insure your proper protection.     What is an office or field review assessment?  When a tax return is not filed by April 1, the property appraiser is required to place an assessment on the property. This assessment represents an estimate based upon the value of businesses with similar equipment and assets. Being assessed does not alleviate you of your responsibility to file an accurate return.     What if I don't agree with the assessed value that appears on my notice of proposed property tax?  In mid-August, the owner of record will receive a notice of proposed property tax covering TPP. If you disagree with your assessment, call your property appraiser or go to the office to discuss the matter. If you have evidence that the appraised value is more than the actual fair market value of your property, the property appraiser will welcome the opportunity to review all the pertinent facts. If you do not agree after talking, then you may file a petition to have the matter reviewed by the Value Adjustment Board, an independent reviewing authority. Should you not agree with the VAB, then you may file suit to have the assessment reviewed in court.     Helpful Hints And Suggestions       File the original return from this office as soon as possible before April 1. Be sure to sign and date your return.     Work with your accountant or C.P.A. to identify any equipment that may have been ""physically removed."" List those items in the appropriate space on your return.     If you have an asset listing or depreciation schedule that identifies each item of equipment, attach it to the completed return.     Do not use vague terms such as ""various"" or ""same as last year.""     It is to your advantage to provide a breakdown of assets since depreciation on each item may vary.     Please include your estimate of fair market value and the original cost of the item on your return. These are important considerations in determining an accurate assessment.     Look for additional information concerning filing within the instructional section of the return itself.     If you sell your business, go out of business, or move to a new location, please inform your property appraiser office promptly. This helps to ensure timely, accurate records.       Back to top           "

There are many individual circumstances which can impact upon the appraisal and filing process. The Property Appraiser welcomes your inquiries. This office is here to serve you and all residents of Jackson County to ensure fair and equitable appraisal of property.       Appraisal Questions      Homestead Exemption      Amendment 10 (Save Our Homes)      Tangible Personal Property                       Appraisal Questions   What does the property appraiser do?   Does the property appraiser levy or collect taxes?   How is property appraised?   What is market value?   Can I get a tax exemption?   Besides Homestead, what other exemptions are available under law?   When will I know the amount of my tax bill?   What if I think the appraised value of my property is too high?   What is an ""AG"" classification?       What does the property appraiser do?   The property appraiser is responsible for identifying, locating, and fairly valuing all property, both real and personal, within the county for tax purposes. The ""market"" value of real property is based on the current real estate market. Estimating the ""market"" value of your property means discovering the price most people would pay for your property in its current condition. What is important to remember is that the property appraiser does not create the value. People establish the value by buying and selling real estate in the market place. The property appraiser has the legal responsibility to study those transactions and appraise your property accordingly. The property appraiser also        tracks ownership changes;      maintains maps of parcel boundaries;      keeps descriptions of buildings and property characteristics up to date;      accepts and approves applications from individuals eligible for exemptions and other forms of property tax relief;      and most importantly, analyzes trends in sales prices, construction costs, and rents to best estimate the value of all assessable property.         Does the property appraiser levy or collect taxes?   No . The property appraiser assesses all property in the county and is neither a taxing authority nor a tax collector. The property appraiser has nothing to do with the amount of taxes levied or collected.   Three separate government entities each having unique and distinct roles in producing your November tax bill. First, the property appraiser annually appraises all property in your county at the market value as of January 1. Next, each taxing authority within the county sets their own millage rate based on the amount of tax dollars necessary to fund their annual budget. Finally, the tax collector takes the amount of taxes due in order to bill and collect all taxes levied within the county.      How is property appraised?   At least once every three years, the property appraiser or a staff appraiser will visit and inspect each property. However, individual property values may be adjusted between visits in light of sales activity or other factors affecting real estate values in your neighborhood. Sales of similar properties are strong indicators of value in the real estate market.    To estimate the value of a property, the property appraiser must identify the properties that have sold, their sale prices and the terms and conditions of the each sale. Each transaction must be studied to make sure that it is an arms-length transaction.   An arm's length transaction is a sale involving a willing seller and a willing buyer without any undue pressure or special incentives (such as family relationships). An arm's length transaction also means that the property was on the market for neither an excessive nor short period of time.   Once this is determined, the property appraiser can base the value of a property on sales of comparable properties. That is why property appraisers maintain an accurate data base of real estate information, and this is the sale comparison approach to value.    The Florida Constitution has been amended effective January 1, 1995 to limit any annual increase in the assessed value of residential property with a homestead exemption to 3 percent  or  the rate of inflation, whichever is lower. This limitation does not include any change, addition or improvement to a homestead (excluding normal maintenance or substantially equivalent replacement). During subsequent years, any improvements will fall under the Constitutional limitation.    Two other methods are used to appraise property - the cost approach and the income approach. The cost approach is based on how much it would cost today to build an almost identical structure on the parcel. If your property is not new, the appraiser must also determine how much the building has lost value over time. The appraiser must also determine the value of the land itself - without buildings or any improvements. The income approach requires a study of how much revenue your property would produce if it were rented as an apartment house, a store, an office building and so on. The appraiser must consider operating expenses, taxes, insurance, maintenance costs, and the return or profit most people would expect on the type of property you own.      What is market value?   Florida Law requires that the just value of all property be determined each year. The Supreme Court of Florida has declared ""just value"" to be legally synonymous to ""full cash value"" and ""fair market value."" The fair market value of your property is the amount for which it could sell on the open market. The property appraiser analyzes these market transactions annually to determine fair market value as of January 1.      Can I get a tax exemption?   In addition to determining values, the property appraiser accepts applications for and administers property tax exemptions. Several types of exemptions are available.   The type of exemption benefiting the largest number of property owners is the HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION. If you own property which you use as your primary residence as of January 1, you may apply for homestead exemption. This will reduce the taxable value of your home by $25,000, resulting in substantial savings on your property taxes.    Any new exemption or change in exemption status should be filed as soon as possible, but no later than March 1.      Besides Homestead, what other exemptions are available under law?        Widow/ Widowers Exemption ($500)-     To file for Widow or Widower's Exemption you must be a widow or widower prior to January 1st of the tax year and bring proof of your spouse's death. (Divorced persons do not qualify for this exemption.)           Disability Exemption ($5000)           In addition to proof of Florida residency, you must provide one of the following:        Proof of total and permanent disability from two [2] professional unrelated licensed Florida physicians, the U.S. Veteran's Administration;      Proof of 10% or more war-time disability from Veteran's Administration;      Present proof of legal blindness.        Total exemption from ad valorem taxation on homestead property for totally and permanently disabled-     Section 196.101, F.S., provides that property owners qualifying for the homestead exemption on January 1, who are quadriplegic, paraplegic, hemiplegic, or other totally and permanently disabled persons, who must use a wheel chair for mobility, or are legally blind and produce certification of that fact from two [2] professionally unrelated licensed Florida physicians, or the U.S. Veteran's Administration, shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation. Except for quadriplegics & Veterans, there is also a gross income limitation for this exemption, governing all persons residing upon the homestead, which is adjusted annually.    Section 196.081, F.S. , provides that property owners qualifying for the homestead exemption on January 1, who are veterans honorably discharged with a service connected total and permanent disability, shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation. Confirmation of the disability from the U.S. Veteran's Administration is required for this exemption. A surviving spouse could enjoy the benefit of this exemption if the veteran was a permanent resident of Florida on January 1 of the year he or she died.       When will I know the amount of my tax bill?   Each August, the property appraiser sends a Truth in Millage (TRIM) notice to all property owners as required by law. This notice is very important -- look for it in the mail! You'll recognize it by prominent lettering, ""DO NOT PAY - This is not a bill.""    The TRIM notice tells you the taxable value of your property. Taxable value is the just value less any exemptions.    The TRIM notice also gives you information on proposed millage rates and taxes as estimated by your community taxing authorities. It also tells you when and where these authorities will hold public meetings to discuss tentative budgets to set your millage tax rates.    Fees not related to your property value may also appear on your TRIM notice for garbage collection, roads, lighting and other government services. These fees are set by your taxing authority and are not affected by any change in the value of your house or property.      What if I think the appraised value of my property is too high?   If you think the taxable value shown on your TRIM Notice is not correct, you are encouraged to contact your property appraiser's office to speak with an appraiser. The appraiser can show you the information used to determine your property's value.      What is an ""AG"" classification?   An agricultural classification is the designation of land by the property appraiser, pursuant to F.S. 193.461, in which the assessment is based on agricultural use value.   To qualify for Agricultural classification, a return must be filed with the property appraiser between January 1 and March 1 of the tax year. Only lands which are used for bona fide agricultural purposes shall be classified agricultural.   ""Bona fide agricultural purposes"" means good faith commercial agricultural use of the land. The property appraiser, prior to classifying such lands, may require the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative to furnish such information as may reasonably be required to establish such lands are actually used for a bona fide agricultural purpose.    The property appraiser may deny agricultural classification to the following lands:       Lands which are not being used for or diverted from agricultural use;      Land that has been zoned non-agricultural at the request of the owner;      Land on which a sub-division plat is recorded;      Land which is purchased for a price three or more times the agricultural appraisal placed on the land.     Back to top       Homestead Exemption Information   What do I need to do?   Where can I file?   What information do I need to bring with me?   When do I apply?   Do I have to be a citizen to qualify?   What if the property is in trust?   Can I get homestead exemption on a mobile home?   Is there any appeal if I miss the deadline for filing?       What do I need to do?   All persons seeking homestead exemption must complete an original application (Form DR-501). The application must be signed and filed in person.      Where can I file?   You can file at the property appraiser's office.      What information do I need to bring with me?        A recorded deed or tax bill in your name.      Social Security numbers for all owners.     The following information to establish proof of residency for all owners who occupy the property must be presented in-person at our office:        Florida driver's license, if you drive or if a non-driver, a declaration of domicile recorded prior to January 1;      Florida auto tag registration, if you drive      Florida voter registration card, if you are registered to vote.                                                                If you do not possess these items, please call the property appraiser for further information.      When do I apply?   The normal filing time for homestead exemption begins on January 1 and lasts through March 1. All exemption applications for that year must be filed by March 1.   Failure to apply on or before March 1, according to law, is a waiver of the exemption privilege for that year.      Do I have to be a citizen to qualify?   Citizenship is not required to file for homestead exemption. An applicant who is not a U.S. citizen must present a resident alien card (green card) when they apply.      What if the property is in trust?   In these cases, it is necessary for the applicant to furnish this office with a copy of the trust agreement. Florida law specifies those situations under which the resident may obtain homestead exemption. The Florida Constitution requires that the homestead claimant have legal title or beneficial title in equity to the property.      Can I get homestead exemption on a mobile home?   Yes, you may if you own the land on which the mobile home is located. When applying, you must bring in the title or registration to the mobile home.      Is there any appeal if I miss the deadline for filing?   Yes. You must file an appeal with the Value Adjustment Board and a late application for homestead exemption at the property appraiser's office in person * . The deadline for filing is set by law -- on or before the 25th day following the mailing of the notice of proposed property taxes (T.R.I.M. notice). This date usually falls in early September. You may call your property appraiser's office to confirm the deadline date.   Approval or denial of the late application is determined by the Value Adjustment Board. This panel will hear your reasons for not filing in a timely manner and make a determination whether or not your application can be approved for that tax year.   * There is a filing fee associated with the appeal.     Back to top       Amendment 10 ""Save Our Homes"" Value Cap   WHAT is the Save Our Homes amendment?   HOW does the amendment limitation apply?   HOW is my property affected?   WHAT about any changes, additions or improvements to the homestead property?   WHAT properties are not subject to the limitation?   WHAT happens if a property is sold or conveyed to a new owner?       What is the Save Our Homes amendment?   Section 193.155(1) of the Florida Statutes was enacted to implement an amendment to the state constitution to limit annual increases in property value assessments on real property qualifying for and receiving homestead exemption.      How does the amendment limitation apply?   Real property shall be assessed at full market value (just value) as of January 1 of the year in which the property first receives the homestead exemption. The following year the property is reassessed and any changes from the prior year's assessed value is not to exceed the lesser of 3% of that prior year assessed value  or  the Consumer Price Index percentage change, (except capital improvements, additions or improvements).      How is my property affected?   The year following the granting of homestead exemption, the property is subject to the limitation.      What about any changes, additions or improvements to the homestead property?   New construction or additions shall be assessed at full market value as of the first January 1 after the changes are substantially completed. In these circumstances, it is possible that the assessed value may exceed the amendment limitations. However; after the first year that the changes are assessed at full market value, they are also subject to the amendment limitations.      What properties are not subject to the limitation?   Residences without homestead, non-residential property, vacant land, tangible personal property, commercial property, and agricultural property are not eligible for the amendment limitation.      Why would my assessment increase when my market value stayed the same?   This is probably due to the ""recapture"" rule. In 1995, the Department of Revenue adopted a rule, approved by the Governor and Cabinet, directing property appraisers to raise the assessed value of a qualifying homestead property by the maximum of 3% or the Consumer Price Index, whichever is less, on all properties assessed at less than full market value (just value).     What happens if a property is sold or conveyed to a new owner?   Once the property has been conveyed to the new owner (and the homestead exemption is interrupted), it is raised to full market value (just value) January 1 of the following year. The new owner must qualify and apply to receive homestead exemption. Even if the property received a homestead exemption under the previous owner, the limitation, just like the exemption, expires January 1 of the year following a change of ownership.

Any questions concerning assessments or filing should be directed to the Property Appraiser's office.    After the assessed value of the tangible personal property is determined by the property appraiser, the certified tax roll is presented to the Revenue Collection Division. The assessment is based on a January 1 status. If a business was open, a unit was rented or a mobile home was owned on January 1, an assessment will be made. There is no Statutory provision for pro-ration in the event of a mid-year sale, closure or liquidation.    It is the job of the Revenue Collection Division to mail the tax notices and collect all taxes due. Tax notices are mailed by November 1 of each year with payment due by March 31. Discounts for early payment are as follows:    4% discount if paid in November    3% discount if paid in December    2% discount if paid in January    1% discount if paid in February    Gross tax amount paid in March, no discounts apply    Pursuant to  Section 197.413, Florida Statutes , Tax Warrants are issued July l on all unpaid tangible personal property. Within 30 days after the warrants are prepared, the Revenue Collection Division applies to the Circuit Court for an order directing levy and seizure of enough tangible personal property to pay the amount of unpaid taxes and costs.    For additional information regarding Tangible Personal Property, the Revenue Collection Division's office can be reached at 954-831-4000.    Any changes to the tax roll (name, address, location, assessed value) must be processed through the  Property Appraiser's office.

In the  common law  systems personal property may also be called  chattels  or  personalty . It is distinguished from  real property , or  real estate . In the  civil law  systems personal property is often called  movable property  or  movables  - any property that can be moved from one location to another. This term is in distinction with  immovable property  or immovables, such as land and buildings.   Historically,  slaves  have often been legally treated as personal property. In some cultures, servants, wives and children have also been considered to greater or lesser degrees to be the personal property ( chattel ) of their husbands, fathers or guardians. For example, in Biblical times, the ancient Hebrews were permitted to sell their daughters into servitude, and servants could be bought or sold as slaves were - although Hebrew servants could not be legally sold to aliens, and male Hebrew servants were set free after serving for 7 years. (see Exodus 20 for details). Even in Victorian times, children could be bought and sold - as chronicled in  Charles Dickens 's novel  Oliver Twist .   Personal property may be classified in a variety of ways.  Tangible personal property  refers to any type of property that can generally be moved (i.e., it is not attached to real property or land), touched or felt. These generally include items such as furniture, clothing, jewelry, art, writings, or household goods. In some cases, there can be formal title documents that show the ownership and transfer rights of that property after a person's death (for example, motor vehicles, boats, etc.) In many cases, however, tangible personal property will not be ""titled"" in an owner's name and is presumed to be whatever property he or she was in possession of at the time of his or her death.   Intangible personal property  or ""intangibles"" refers to personal property that cannot be actually ""moved"" touched or felt, but instead represents something of value such as  negotiable instruments ,  securities ,  goods , and  intangible assets  including  chose in action .   Accountants also distinguish personal property from real property because personal property can be  depreciated  faster than improvements (while land is not depreciable at all). It is an owner's right to get tax benefits for chattel, and there are businesses that specialize in appraising personal property, or chattel.   The distinction between these types of property is significant for a variety of reasons. Usually one's rights on movables are more attenuated than one's rights on immovables (or real property). The  statutes of limitations  or  prescriptive periods  are usually shorter when dealing with personal or movable property. Real property rights are usually enforceable for a much longer period of time and in most jurisdictions real estate and immovables are registered in government-sanctioned land registers. In some jurisdictions, rights (such as a  lien  or other security interest) can be registered against personal or movable property.   In the common law it is possible to place a  mortgage  upon real property. Such mortgage requires payment or the owner of the mortgage can seek  foreclosure . Personal property can often be secured with similar kind of device, variously called a  chattel mortgage , trust receipt, or  security interest . In the United States, Article 9 of the  Uniform Commercial Code  governs the creation and enforcement of security interests in most (but not all) types of personal property.   There is no similar institution to the mortgage in the civil law, however a  hypothec  is a device to secure  real rights  against property. These real rights follow the property along with the ownership. In the common law a lien also remains on the property and it is not extinguished by alienation of the property; liens may be real or  equitable .   Many jurisdictions levy a personal  property tax , an annual tax on the privilege of owning or possessing personal property within the boundaries of the jurisdiction. Automobile and boat registration fees are a subset of this tax. Most household goods are exempt as long as they are kept or used within the household; the tax usually becomes a problem when the taxing authority discovers that expensive personal property like art is being regularly stored outside of the household.     [ edit ]   Personal vs Private property   In political/economic theory, notably  anarchism ,  communism  and some  socialist  philosophies, the distinction between private and personal property is extremely important. They are separated by a blurry boundary, which items of property constitute which is open to debate.     Personal property  is part of your person and includes property from which you have the right to exclude others (e.g TVs, cars, clothes etc). [ 1 ]       Private property  is a  social relationship , not a relationship between person and thing according to  Marx  (e.g factories, mines, dams, infrastructure etc). In  capitalism  there is no distinction between personal and private property. [ 2 ]       To many socialists, the term  private property  refers to capital or the means of production, while personal property refers to consumer and non-capital goods and services.

The Agreement will be effective May 1, 2009.    Here is a link to the revised  Home Valuation Code of Conduct :    And here is Cuomo's  statement  on the Agreement:     ""This revised agreement with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a step forward: it preserves the core goals of ensuring appraiser independence and eliminating systemic conflicts of interest. It also incorporates common-sense suggestions of industry participants that increase flexibility and efficiency. Under this agreement, Fannie and Freddie commit to purchasing only those loans that are supported by appraisals conducted independently and honestly. Erecting and enforcing meaningful firewalls between appraisers and lenders, and forcing Fannie and Freddie to stop working with unscrupulous lenders and brokers, are key steps in cleaning up the mortgage industry and avoiding another crisis like this in the future. My office looks forward to working with the new Administration in making more reforms to the system in the New Year.""    We will be reading through this revised Agreement and providing our thoughts.  However, we are always curious what appraisers think.

No longer will the most seasoned and experienced, as well as geographical local appraiser, be elgible for appraisal assignments. The Appraisal Managament Corporations make assignments based on the cheapest and fastest. Clearing the way for entry level appraisers covering many counties, sometimes 10-15, without local MLS board membership or geographic competence required, to service real estate agents clients in the sales of their listings. Of course even though appraisal fees will be cut in half to the individual appraiser the borrower will not see any savings at all. Most likely the HUD 1 closing statements will reflect a more than typical fee. The difference of course will be profit to the Appraisal Managment Company. These AMC's will continue to compete against each other in terms of speed and price leaving the homeownner, borrower and agents at the mercy of poor quality appraisal work. Many agents I have spoke with refuse to even make the appointment with ""out of area"" AMC appraisers citing due diligence to the seller in a transaction. They are probably correct. As far as appraiser independence goes these is so far away from the intent it is unbelieveable. In the past an appraiser could turn down any assignment or just say no to any undue influence, now AMC's will exert the most pressure on appraisers, 100's at a time, and refusal to cooperate will lead to removal from their ""blind rotating"" list. (which is neither blind nor rotating, again is based on cheapest and fastest)I wonder how long it will be before we have Agent Managment Corporations, approved by banking industry and based on lowest commissions and total average days to contract performance ? It is also hard to believe that this HVCC stemmed from an investigation and subsequent findings that WAMU and a large Appraisal Managment Company conspired to commit fraud. So.... the answer is to mandate that this same business model become the industry standard ? A sad day for the real estate industry, appraisers, agents, homehowners, borrowers and the public at large.  At some point I guess it will be time to make the appraisal profession extinct and use tax assessed values or even worse... the banks own Automated Valuation Models. As a Realtor  I would probably just get that up front. No since in spending time with a CMA or a lot of marketing. negotiating skills are not needed. It is what ever the bank says it is. So what will they need Realtors for ? Just to place a sign in the yard and fill out a contract. I don't think that will pay very much.  Sad ..... Very Sad.

They DO provide appraisal services yet are not licensed, WHY?   As long as the CHEAPEST appraiser gets selected for the assignment(the way the amc's work) quality goes out the window. After all, isn't that what this is all about...quality appraisals.   Get rid of the amc's and those appraisers that do not do the correct thing and this industry will turn around real fast.

If state appraiser boards did their jog with current regulations, this wouldn't be necessary. 22 years of hard honest work out the window.

This code does not change any rules or acceptable code that is not already in place.   3. The code seems to drive the choice of appraiser into the heretofore non-existent AMC business.  The AMC's of course will skim off some of the appraiser's fee and anyone who does not agree with that will be stricken from their LIST.   c.  Truly independent and honest fessional appraisers who comply with USPAP and state laws should not have to be on any type of Apprved List to do an appraisal for a lender.  In the past this has been discriminitory and exclusionary.    d. Who will establish and run the Independent Valuation Protection Institute?  We already have state agencies and the Appraisal Institute that seem to do a good job.   e. What will be the result of Appraisal Quality Control. As in the past I think it will lead to ""no think"" canned appraisal phrazes and clauses that will pass QC.    f. Appraiser misconduct action will be conducted by state licensing agencies.

The use of ""Appraisal Management Companies"" as a ""firewall"" are costing the realtor's customer, the buyer, higher fees, as the AMC's act as a ""middleman"" and only pay the appraiser around $175 to perform a full residential valuation and keep the rest. The majority of professional appraiser's will simply not work for these extremely low fees as our overhead for insurance,softftware,licensing,education, MLS fees are expensive. Only those less qualified appraiser's will work for lower fees. The role of the underwriter, in their review of the appraisal is sufficient to ""firewall"" appraiser independence, if they follow Fannie/Freddie guidelines when reading the report  This bill, when implemented, will cause many, good, professionals to seek employment in a new career/field where their expertise and time is properly compnsated.

It therfore, seems counter intuitive to develop a system where all or almost all appraisals will be ordered through an AMC.      All of the good appraisers who have spent a great deal of time and effort to develop a working releationship with ethical lenders and mortgage brokers are and will be forced to accept a very reduced fee for the same or more amount of work.  In all of this HVCC the problem of dealing with un-ethical mortgage loan officers (sales people) is not addressed.  That seems very strange as it is from the un-ethical loan officers that the majority of the undue pressures came from.    Real Estate Appraisers must meet educational, training and licensing requirements, while in most states there is no licensing, training or ecucational requirements what-so-ever for loan officers.  Thus no recourse to the loan officers.  Many of the AMCs that this HVCC have caused to come into being charge the appraiser as much 50% or more of the normal appraisal fee just to get work assignet to them.  So now a profession where the typical appraiser earns about $40,000 or less a year are being told in no uncertin terms that they will be expected to work for half of that.  The only folks that will benifit from this HVCC are AMCs.  They are set up to be the folks who run the appraisal industry and will control the whole mortgage lending cycle.  No good will come of this whole process.

His excuse was that it is ""an opinion of value"". When the opinion is based on desire not fact the appraiser should loose their license and in some cases serve a minimum jail time of 1+ yrs. Disreputable people do not read or care about the rules.

All it will do is cause other problems as it still allows for AVM's to have a say in the lending process. Nothing should take the place of an appraiser inspection of a subject property. Most appraisers are honest and were just ""following the market"" in the recent runup of values. Remember, we use ""closed sales"" as comparables. The real problem was with investors and with the relaxed lending standards, especially to investors.   You will find that the appraisers that will work for AMC""s will be younger and inexperienced. They will be hungry, and will take on many jobs from many AMC's. AMC's put a very short time linit on both the appraiser accepting the appraisal assignment and in the expected turnaround time. This will result in well below sub-par appraisals because of inexperience, not having the time that is actually needed to complete an appraisal properly and the lower fees that will be paid to the appraiser. The appraiser will not be able to afford the time it takes to do an appraisal properly and still make a decent living. Just because an appraisal is done through an AMC does not mean it will be a good appraisal. You are going about this the wrong way and a lot of good appraisers will not have work as the AMC's will be sending work the one's who get the work done quickly. All that needs to be done is have quality control done properly, by the lender and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That plus making someone actually qualify for a mortgage and have a down payment will solve this problem. I have been appraising since 1985 and have seen appraisers get blame for many things that are not actually not the fault of the appraiser. In time you will find that good appraisers do good work and bad appraisers will do bad work, whether is is for an AMC or not. Mandating the use of AMC's will cause many appraisers to make less while the AMC'c will make huge profits at the expense of the good appraisers.

WHAT IS CUOMO DOING, THESE NEW RULES APPEAR TO PUSH APPRAISERS/AMC'S TO BREAK USPAP LAWS/RULES AND ALLOW FOR NEW APPRAISERS TO BREAK THE COMPETENCY RULES BY WORKING FOR/WITH AMC'S?  WHAT IS NEEDED IS REGIONAL CO-OPS NOT AMC'S.  AMC'S SHOULD BE OUTLAWED IN MY OPINION.  GOOD APPRAISERS ARE GOING TO LEAVE THIS PROFESSION IF THIS KIND OF REGULATION KEEPS  UP.  IT APPEARS TO ME THERE IS TO MANY THAT DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS  AND APPRAISING THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE REGULATING PROCESS.

Great for the  Skippy Appraiser! The current HVCC does nothing to protect appraisers; moreover, it will allow lenders & AMCs to further destroy the profession and ""capture"" appraisers. Since it has been proven time & again this crisis was NOT the fault of the appraiser more than the  fallout from the allowances that ""every one in America should own a Home"" and the shortly- there-after affect of laxed borrowering restrictions & more Creative Financing! I have been an ethical and deligent appraiser for 23 years. In the past many months, my income has been cut to a level that I can not continue my profession, pay mandatory fees, E&O, cont ed, and operating expenses, etc due to the robbery of the Lender and the AMC splitting what should be my full fee. My experience is AMCs demand that I reduce my fee and promise a 24 hour turn-time. If I don't except both conditions I am not given the assignment and also am taken off the active approved list. An ethical, diligent, compliant report could take longer than a mandatory 24 hours turn-time and surely is more worthy of a less than half fee. If any one up there cares: a recent example of my experience with an AMC: Ordered several appraisals in a close time period, the AMC sent the reports to their client, the bank. We must always wait weeks but as soon as I mentioned payment for services rendered, they disappeared after sending a not-sufficient funds check. ...Out thousands of half-service fee earned dollars. The AMC's ""client"", the Bank indicated they were ""not my client"" (to be clear the bank says they are not my client) and did not have to pay as they had paid the now missing ""AMC"". So, Who is who's client? It was never MY choice to have to use the AMC, it was the banks and therefore the banks ""client"". The bank indicated I would need to take my issues up with the AMC not the Bank. The AMC was MIA.  There are no rules for Banks or AMCs, no ethical guidelines, no licenses...not that I or ""THEY"" are aware of. TO PROTECT & SERVE the PUBLIC?...really???  Example: AMCs do not allow me to respond to the homeowners questions regarding the fee for appraisal services. ...the  difference in the fee they paid for the appraisal service and what the appraiser actually received as payment. Typically far less than half of what the borrower assumes the appraiser received. The bank and the AMC split the greater majority of the fee! What about the borrower..  Isn't the ultimate important reason for appraisal laws, rules, and guidelines to Protect the PUBLIC? As a borrower I would assume ""scam"" if I knew I had paid an appraisal fee and it did not pay for the ""appraisal"". As the borrower, I would be looking for my money back and someone to ""Pay"" for the scam. Should we just work for free? Can we get on some type of government program so we can do OUR Protect & Serve J-O-B? There are times the AMC demands that the appraiser collect the service fee from the homeowner ...not to keep but to send to the AMC. We must deposit the check in our business account and send the AMC our company check with hopes of possibly receiving our crumbs cut months later. In the AMCs Appraisal Approval process it is required we supply confidential SS information, what guidelines do they have to keep that information confidential? There are AMCs set-ups that certianly take half of the borrowers appraisal fee but also make the appraiser pay a service fee to send the report through their service site. Is there anyone out there that cares. Can't you see this is out-of-control? From the date in history, when  Laws and Guidelines came into affect, what did you want us to do or be other than to ""Protect and Serve"" the public from less than ethical lenders. Well we can't do that job anymore, we won't be around. To my demise..WOW HOW BROKEN!!

Several times it talks about the ""lender OR third party affiliated with lender"" so I don't see where management companies are endorsed by this rule.  However, I do think that management companies definately do not earn the 50% of the fee that they collect.  Also I don't care for the Individual Valuation Protection Institute and the quality control testing of 10% ""or other significant percentage"" of appraisals, whatever that means.    Sometimes government rules or laws say one thing and end up causing another, and it may be that this rule causes appraisal management companies to be used exclusively, which, as it seems most of us agree, is a bad thing.  However, isn't this a done deal?  What can appraisers do to protect our incomes from shrinking and provide for reliability of our work product?

My office consists of 4 certified FHA approved appraisers. We all feel your pain. The question that needs to be addressed is ""What are we going to do about it?"". Stop the whining,stop the ""poor me,this is unfair"" We need to move on and combat this problem. The lenders have there game plan in place,its amazing that they created this mess and already have a plan in place and it doesn't include the independent,ethical,honest appraiser,what kind of game plan do we have? The answer is none. Who is our voice in Washington? we have none. The sollution isn't getting out of the buisiness,it's not accepting 50% of our normal fees for double the work which gets reviewed by a minimal wage ,inexperienced,incompetent reviewer who relies on sites like Zillow to determine the estimated value of a dwelling and if your appraised value doesn't meet or is less than that figure ,they put you through a living hell. It certainly not having to accept management company policies. The days of the 2-3 hour appraisals are over. Thats fact and wont change. We can already see the ripple affect of this economic mess that were in. Sales are down nearly 30% from last year,values are down between 10-15%, are comparable base has shrunk. Management companies aren't the answer. The experienced,hard working ethical appraiser is. That is all of you who care enough to respond on this site. We need to band together and say no.Whats the sollution? I wish I had the answers. We need to start first by refusing work from management companies. I also suggest that each and everyone of you out there that pay between $600-1000 to your E&O agent to contact them and ask what they can do to provide some type of legal assistance to help us stay in this buisiness. Over the many years I've been in this buisiness I've never had a claim or an issue.It's time to ask your agent ""what can you provide us?"" Without all of us donating to insurance premiums it will eventually affect them.Lets hope that its not to late. I'm looking forward to logging in and hopefully reading some ideas or possible sollutions. WE NEED TO BAND TOGETHER.    Robert P Panicali  Certified Appraisal Assoc.

There are only three possible solutions:     I. Create an organization to promote NO MORE AMC WORK!    or     II. Class Action Lawsuit    or     III. Quit the business    Solution I. would be the easiest and cheapest with a May 1, 2009 deadline.      Solution II. may work but will be a long long process.  The good news is that the National Mortgage Brokers Association is very much interested in this solution as well.      Putting together an organization for either cause would also build a great foundation for a forming a National Association Of Appraisers. Something we need with mandatory membership and mandatory (yet inexpensive) dues. Without a national organization we will continue to be trampled, raped, & robbed by both AMCs and banking interest.    You have two weapons to choose from for this fight.  Pick one or run.

AMC's make their life easier and the quality of the report is secondary, end of story.  It's a shame, but after 15+ years of hard ethical work I will be out of business.

As the AMC will control the market, they may even delay that even longer.  Yet there is some good news, some states are yet rather late, now thinking about licensing any AMC before they can do business in any state they do this so called service in.  Why did not anyone ask appraisers about how to fix this mess than this white wash they think will look good as they clear up their own mess that may take years to do, and this AMC taking over the industry will only take the industry longer to fix the mortgage mess.  SPEED Kills, and I see this no different, cheap and fast appraisals will only dig the industry further into a hole, and that means a longer and deeper Depression for the country.    Put as no one asked us, and no one but appraisers reads this blog, we just go down with the rest of the country.  These comments is from an appraiser with 34 years experience and have fired every AMC she has tried to work for, for the unprofessional way they do business, but now they have conned and scammed the industry in to believing the AMC is the cure, but the appraisers know that AMC's are one of the reasons for this Mortgage Mess, like when WAMU used only LSI to do there contracting of appraisals, that AMC is one of the worst and largest AMC out there.  Good luck all.  I can't afford to retire on full fees, so I will have to figure how to keep doing Professional work with now this new mess starts in full in about May.

Please take your time and get the word out that we can not have inexperienced appraisers putting values on homes.  This (housing-mortgage)mess will just get worse.

Been there done that.  They don't care.  FNMA & Freddie Mac received tens of thousands of letter from appraisers.      They knew exactely what our complaints were.  They were fully aware appraisers would end up giving up 50% -60% of our fees.  They were also aware that appraiser had no organized group to put up a fight.    OFHEOs decision to go ahead with HVCC was contolled 100% by very large banks (think Bank Of America & J P Morgan) and very large AMCs.

As a skilled, honest and ethical appraiser - I was fighting a constant uphill battle against the coruption of the mortgage system at the time. I threw in the towel and began working for select AMC's rather than compromising my integrity and have never looked back or regretted it.  The key word here is ""select AMC's"". Granted, fees are discounted, some more than others - but I have managed to find several who are a very good value as their fees are still reasonable, they pay within 2-4 weeks like clockwork, I never have to spend time in collections,you don't have to attend to several nagging underwriter stips once appraisal passes the initial quality review (easy to do after you learn their expectations), no one pressures for value, the AMC handles all homeowner and LO calls and statusing and most communications can all be done online. This has actually lead to less work for me overall, and so a lower fee (within reason) has worked out. It's not perfect (nothing is), of course there are downsides and even though it is a rare occasion that I actually meet a turn time request -  the orders continue to come in pretty regularly. The key again, has been my own selectiveness in who I choose to work for.  I seek out those who quarantee quick payment and refuse any that will not pay at least my own set minimum fee. I do take issue with the idea that only inferior appraisers work for AMC's..  I am not a ""skippy"", I have 20 years experience in real estate and 10 of those as full time appraiser. I take great pride in the quality of my work and take time to perform due diligence in each and every assignment.  I am the sole support of a family of 3 - it's a modest middle-income living, but seeing the current job woes of my neighbors, friends and family - I am happy to have it.

Mortgage brokers that have been around anytime, knows the rules an can be worked with. Fees that were established in about 1991 when we all got licensed, now more and more folks want their cut.  Good luck going with the folks most of us feel are the problem, not the cure.  If we have to go with them, then treat us as professionals and give us real fees and time to do our work correctly, not asking how fast, and how cheap are you and keeping half or more our fee.  That makes for POOR work and canned comments, garbage in, and garbage out.  This HVCC is all just a white wash so it looks like they are doing something as the lenders are in such a mess, they can't keep track of mortgage payments, or what property is in foreclosure or not.  Then they go out in buy other Banks with bigger problems, it's a mess.  Blaming mortgage brokers and appraisers is not the problem, too big is fail is the problem, and it's going to get a lot worse, before it gets better.

I believe that the quality of the loan process will suffer greatly if these proposed changes are made. Those who seek to change this interaction between the appraisers and the loan originators do not realize the increased cost and the greater risk that will be placed on the borrowers shoulders.    When I order an appraisal I need my appraiser to know unlessa certain value is there, tonot proceed with the appraisal. Very frequently, in fact on almost every loan I ask them to run comps first to make sure the value is there. I dont want to waste my timeor the clients money if the loan cant be closed. Many times, they have both told me that value requested was not available. Thats what an honest appraiser should do. I believe the vast majority do just that. If the few bad apples arent playing by the rules, there are ways to deal with them.  What about putting greater responsibility on the lenders who review the appraisals? If an appraiser does poor work or is using fraud to justify a value, the bank should refuse to accept his work. This is done all the time now, but needs to be a streamlined process with rights and responsibilities for both sides.   I only use two appraisers that I trust to perform all my appraisals for me.  -   When I closed a loan in  Florida  for example I used someone that doesnt know how I work and vice versa. The last loan I did in  Florida , the appraiser was almost a week late getting me the appraisal, had drastically cut the value to an absurd level in my opinion and then cursed me out and threatened not to send the appraisal even though he had already been paid. A terrible experience from start to finish. Why was it so bad?  In my opinion it was that bad because I had no idea what the appraiser was like and how he conducted business. He also did not know what I expected of him. I dont know of anyone that likes to do business with a person they dont know.  -  This happens occasionally now due to geography.  It could happen every single time very soon!! It will be a new person that you must place your trust in for every single transaction.  This can be what happens on VA loans when we dont interact and order the appraisals.  You are taking the factor of accountability out of the loan originators hands . The appraiser will not be as likely to put in the time to find the comps that justifythe sales price/value. Its also true that we have no protections against, lazy, unscrupulous or just plain poor appraisers. We will have none and certainly our customers will have no protections either.  Once again the rule that is designed to help people will hurt them. They just dont know it yet. And who do you think they will blame. Some nameless, faceless appraiser or the person (loan officer) who told them everything would work and that the loan they wanted, the loan they needed, the loan they had to have wont work?  We wont even be able to tell them why if these rules are enforced . We will get into trouble for asking questions and making sure they did their job correctly.  -   When I began this business I used a few appraisers before I selected the two I currently have chosen to use. They didnt do a good job, they made mistakes and when I asked them to correct their mistakes they took days, sometimes weeks to even return a phone call.   If this lack of contact is encouraged and even mandated; this will occur over and over from coast to coast. Make no mistake; this will directly affect the borrowers in a negative fashion. Loans will take longer to close, locks will be extended at a cost to the borrower, and many loans that should close simply will not. All because people in power dont think throughthe ramifications of their decisions.  Shouldnt that be EVERYONES first interest?  -  Whats best for the borrower?   more on the new appraisal changes   -     Brent Mendelson                  Tags:  appraisal changes will affect quality of loan process                     This entry was posted             on Monday, March 31st, 2008 at 4:58 pm      and is filed under  1) Questions for Loan Officer ,   2) General .

Stover  Says:              July 23rd, 2008 at 6:26 pm         I had an appraiser come out to check my house out recently. This was for a refinance. I have gone through the process a couple times before, so I’m not new to it. My house was built in ‘33 and has been a rental for years, so it’s not real pretty. Still, the appraiser’s report was filled with glaring untruths. As a result, my refinance is in jeopardy. The appaiser said that I had a leaky roof which is totally untrue. In fact, about 7 years ago, a brand new roof was installed (two years before I bought it). She saw evidence of leaking from years ago, and concluded that the leakage was recent, and that my roof needed repairing. She also said that I had a water damage problem in my hallway, which is also incorrect. I was stripping old wall paper off the wall there, and she wrongly concluded that water was coming in. So, what does a home owner do about crummy appraisers who don’t use their noggins?                    Brent  Says:              July 24th, 2008 at 9:02 am         Sorry to hear about your problem. This story makes my case in some ways. The first and only call I would make is to your loan officer. He or she works for you and the appraiser works for the loan officer. They hired them and they need to take some responsbility for the quality of the work. If I was your loan oficer I would be on the phone to the appraiser and make sure that they were doing the best job possible. If I felt they were not, I would fire them and get a new appraiser. And I would more than likely pay for it because it doesn’t sound like your fault. The way this makes my point is that if we as loan officers don’t hire the appraisers, we will have NO influence or pull with the appraisers. The appraiser will not care what we say, not care if we don’t hire them again and they will do what they want and how they want. Bottom line the accountability will be taken out of the appraisal process and that won’t help anyone, especially the homeowner.                    APPRAISER  Says:              July 29th, 2008 at 10:26 pm         HELLO, I WAS SHOCKED TO READ YOUR ARTICLE. I AM NOT SURE IF YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT THE CURRENT LAWS ARE. THE MORTGAGE BROKER OR THE LENDER OR ANY ONE ORDERING AN APPRAISAL. CANNOT PREDETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE HOME. IT IS ILLEGAL FOR AN APPRAISER TO ACCEPT AN ASSIGNMET BASED ON ANY PRE DETERMINED VALUE. SO WHEN YOU ORDER AN APPRAISAL AND ASK YOUR APPRAISER TO HIT A CERTAIN VALUE OR OTHERWISE STOP!! BECAUSE YOU DONT WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME OR THE BORROWERS MONEY. THATS JUST CRAB TALK !!!    BY THE WAY, A COMP CHECK IS AN APPRAISAL. AND THE APPRAISER SHOULD GET PAID FOR THAT SERVICE. LET THE APPRAISER DO THIER JOB AND GET PAID. AND IF THE VALUE IS NOT THERE? TOO BAD. THE APPRAISER SERVICE IS NOT COMMITIONED BASED . ITS A FEE SERVICE. THATS WHAT THE NEW LAWS ARE AFTERE. TO PREVENT ALL MORTGAGE BROKERS FOR SHOPPING FOR THE VALUE NEEDE TO DO THIER LOAN TO VALUE. THE BIG PROBLEM HERE IS THAT MORTGAGE BROKERS ARE CLUELEDD OF THE LAWS, OR JUST PLAYING STUPID. AND THEY SHOULD BE REGULATED AND EDUCATED MORE.                    loan officer  Says:              July 30th, 2008 at 9:12 am         “APPRAISER”, i think you are missing the broker’s points…  especially when trying to avoid spending a homeowner’s money when the value isn’t there.  The Broker would be irresponsible to hire an appraiser if he definitely can’t get value.  You wouldn’t have the work to begin with if it weren’t for this Broker hiring you… and he is only going to hire you if he knows there’s a chance you can get the value he needs.  My god, take an english writing class… did you complete the 3rd grade?                    Brent  Says:              July 30th, 2008 at 11:10 am         First off appraiser, stop yelling and calm down. I am aware of the current laws. We are not telling appraisers anything that violates the law. I do send value requests to appraisers. I don’t care what you think, I will not waste my time, my clients time and most importantly their money if the value needed to perform the loan is not there. When I don’t appraisers call me and ask what value is needed to make this deal work. No one is telling an appraiser they must hit a pre-determined value. If the value isn’t there, it isn’t there end of story. Are you telling me that is I send 2, 5 or 10 appraisers to the same home ALL will give me the same value? Because that is a very silly thing to say, I have multiple appraisers that give different values on the same property. Sometimes I am surprised how far off they are. So if you think that doing some research and some scouting to make sure a deal can work is such a horrible thing then so be it. As I said, I will not waste the time and money and reputation of my company charging people for appraisals that can’t be used. By the way if you think pulling some comps on MRIS is an appraisal and you should be paid for that then you are the only appraiser that I have come across that feels that way. I would never do business with someone that acts and feels the way you do. I imagine that most loan officers feel the same way about your arrogance. “Just pay me no matter if you can do your loan or not”  I can promise you that people will have tougher times, more expenses and an overall higher level of frustration if they take the appraisals to some remote, bureaucratic national call center. There will be no accountability to the borrower or the loan officer who works for the borrower. And seriously, take a minute and read over what you just wrote.                    Bobbi  Says:              August 25th, 2008 at 5:31 pm         My lender has requested 6 comps, they threw out 2 and then asked for another, which they then threw out and are now deciding whether or not to get a whole new appraisal.   My property was appraised (new purchase/new loan) at $5,000 above the sale price. Some features/benefits of the home were missed, but it still came in higher than the price.  Is this also a common tactic? or delay?                    Brent  Says:              August 26th, 2008 at 9:42 am         Bobbi,   They can do that if they feel like the comps used are wrong for some reason. Some of those would be too far away from your home, not the same type of property, too old , things of that nature. T                    Brent  Says:              August 26th, 2008 at 9:47 am         Bobbi,   Sorry the post wasn’t quite finished. Six is alot of comps to ask for, but there is a reason for the extra level of scrutiny. They must feel the home is located in an area of declining home value. Bobbi, it could be a delay tactic but more likely just a sign of the lending industry becoming more careful affter years of letting anything get by.                    Jeff Deuitch  Says:              September 11th, 2008 at 3:48 pm         ‘In doing some research regarding our appraisal industry, I came  across your web site.  I am not commenting to be discourteous but to hopefully inform you how appraisal ethics and laws work.   I have to say I was in disbelief when I saw the comments  “When I order an appraisal I need my appraiser to know unless a certain value is there, to not proceed with the appraisal.”   I hope you have heard the term USPAP.  This a an abbreviation for Unifrom Standards of Professional Practice which is published by the Appraisal Foundation which was born out of the Federal FIRREA act back in the late 1980’s   USPAP has been adopted into law in all 50 states.  While it contains many guidelines and advisroy opinions, two are the most prominent.   1. All property characteristics which affect value must be clearly reported. This includes any defects or unfinished areas.   2. It is a violoation of USPAP (and state law by default) to accept any appraisal assignment contingent upon a minimum value.   USPAP violoations are the most common cause of license suspensions and revocations.   Clearly, precomping, calling if value does not seem attainable, or other acts which compromise appraier independence are unacceptible and will likely become illegal in upcomming legislation.  The spirit and intent of USPAP and other laws and regulations is to eliminate lender interferrence and pressure such as described in the statements you proudly proclaim in your web site.   The HVCC will remove any interferrence or influence by LO’s or other vested indivuals by taking the appraiser selection process out of the equation.  This will be a welcome chage for appraisers, although some appraiser have issues of their own with the HVCC.   As for our company, we only accept assignment where we are given an address, client, and contact info to get access. No owner’s opinions of value, requested value or any other form of interferrence is tolerated.   The statements you make in your site which claim to be positive attributes, are in fact highly unethical behaviours on the part of appraisers and will likely become quite illegal in the near future.   It is, in fact, the job (and a compensated one)  of an appraiser, to estiamte market value. Period and end of story.  Just like a jeweler who is appraising jewelry. We are paid to estiamte the value of a property.  No considerations, such as if the value is high enough are pertinent.  We are paid for a professional opinion of value and not for prostitution services.   I know you do not welcome unsolicited comments form people who you do not know. As mentioned, I am trying to educate and nothing more.  If you have an interest in how the appraisal community as a whole feels, I invite you to log on to appraisersforum.com and I hope you will see that my opinions are shared by a substantial portion of other appraisers.   Thanks for listening.  Jeff Deuitch  Owner  Manatee Appraisal Service’  Palmetto, FL ‘                    Brent Mendelson  Says:              September 11th, 2008 at 3:49 pm         Jeff,   I appreciate the time to respond and the effort to educate me and others interested in this subject. I am not an appraiser and don’t know all the rules and laws the govern appraisers. The most important thing to me is that my client receive the best deal possible and that I can make good the loan as promised. I will never understand anyone that would want my client to pay for an appraisal if the value they need to make the deal work isn’t there. If it’s not possible to do it, that’s fine. I would never want, ask or expect an appraiser to do ANYTHING to risk their license or good name.  If I send you an order though with a value of 300k and its 250k when you check, why on earth would I actually want you to perform the appraisal and give me something that is worthless to the client? Nothing I have ever done would in the least compromise an appraiser’s independence. I expect it as a courtesy and a cost of doing business that an appraiser do some homework prior to actually seeing the property. If you would like to call it interference by protecting my clients from unscrupulous appraisers that have no accountability to anyone then so be it. Let’s be clear I am in no way casting that aspersion on you. I have seen some pretty bad appraisers in my career though. I want to be extremely clear in what I am about to say next though; I have never interfered and or pressured an appraiser to hit a certain value. If they can’t then they can’t. I can tell you that appraising is an art not a science and I have had two different appraisers look at the same home and come up almost 50k different. That is an extreme but even on little condos I have had different numbers come back. How would you explain that?  Plus in the times of falling markets, especially your market, wouldn’t going some basic research be expected? If a home was worth 300k last year and is not worth 180k don’t I as a lender need to know that right away?   I believe you make my point about the homeowner be hurt by the proposed changes. You call it lender interference and pressure that will be eliminated. I call it looking out for the homeowner and making sure before we spend 400 bucks of his own money, there is a chance that he may actually get full service for his money. Creating a new unaccountable central bureaucracy will HURT the borrowers and that’s all that should really matter. I don’t know how that will help you either by the way. You would get the name, address and phone number of the borrower, you would also get written instructions not to proceed unless you were in the ballpark of a certain value. You would be free to decline such a request, and in my opinion you would be in the extreme minority of your profession.  If it becomes illegal to advocate for my clients to make sure they get a loan that closes then it’s become a strange world indeed. I still believe there should be a benchmark or a minimum value for you as a goal.  Your next to last paragraph is accurate and offensive at the same time.  That description is your job no doubt about it. And just like a jeweler, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and everyone comes up a bit differently. That’s why the requested value is on the appraisal order form, not to pressure you or threaten you. Have lenders done that in the past? No question. Stand up and have some integrity and backbone and say no. Plus where were the underwriters that looked the other way as appraisers doctored the numbers? I will not accept the blame for just my industry when there is plenty to go around, including yours Jeff. The prostitution comment is just weird and will be ignored.  And you are quite wrong; I value your comments and thoughts very highly. I do have a different opinion though, I think you are looking out for yourself and not the borrower and I disagree with that approach. Thanks again for writing in and feel free to check back again.   Brent Mendelson  Choice Finance  Senior Mortgage Banker  O-301-881-8900 X123                    The Appraiser Out in the Hamptons  Says:              September 11th, 2008 at 9:50 pm         “When I order an appraisal I need my appraiser to know unless a certain value is there, to not proceed with the appraisal.”   Determining whether or not a certain value is there is, by definition, an appraisal. The appraiser cannot simply pull out a value and be done with it. Developing and reporting requirements apply, the appraiser must have a workfile,  and the appraiser has liability.   “Very frequently, in fact on almost every loan I ask them to run comps first to make sure the value is there. I dont want to waste my time or the clients money if the loan cant be closed.”   Why is it fine for you to protect the buyer by not wasting your (or the borrower’s) time and money, but yet demand that the appraiser waste his/her time and money if the value isn’t what you want to hear?   “Many times, they have both told me that value requested was not available. Thats what an honest appraiser should do. I believe the vast majority do just that.”   An honest appraiser must abide by state law and be independent. Many appraisers are happy to do just that. Whether or not the value is what you do/don’t want to hear is not relevant to the appraiser getting paid. To do otherwise is to take on the advocacy rule and violate the law.    Many mortgage brokers that the point of view that everyone else plays by the same rules that do…not true at all. Persons such as myself that have multiple licenses completely understand that. As a salesperson, I play the role of advocate for my client. As an appraiser, I am an advocate for the appraisal and nothing else. While mortgage brokers often do not understand that, lenders, attorneys, CPAs, and most other client types do.                    Elliott Reed  Says:              September 11th, 2008 at 10:33 pm         Brent,  You seem to have the same attitude as most Mortgage Brokers.  Unfortunately,  MB’s are exempt from the consequences of the bad loans they make.  You pick  up that nice loan fee at closing and never have anything to do with the loan after  that.  Neither did the Wall Street financial types who leveraged lots of investors  money and ended producing, ‘no doc’ subprime mortgage bonds that have turned  out to be virtually worthless, while in the conventional market Fannie Mae screwed  the pooch too.   The US had one of the best mortgage systems in the world, but right now its in  the toilet.  Its not because of most appraisers, though the ‘good’ appraisers you  prefer contributed to the mess more than most.  If you think that its just not fair  that you can’t ‘pick’ your appraiser, wait, there will be lots of changes you won’t  like.  The reason is no one is going to foot the bill for a mortgage system that  is broken and is only good at losing lots of money.     The last time I was in Las Vegas I mentioned to my cabbie that I was a real estate  appraiser, he said, “Really, I use to be a mortgage broker, then one day they  pulled the rug out, lost their funding source and closed the business.”                    Jeff Deuitch  Says:              September 11th, 2008 at 10:40 pm         I have often had lengthy conversations with young mortgage brokers making request for guaranteed values.  Initially I was quite put off by this, but after some thought, I decided that in many cases this was not malicious, but learned from the “elders”.  Taking a different tact, I decided to explain USPAP (not that I am a scholar of USPAP and certain provisions can be confusing).  Of course, USPAP only regulates the appraiser. MB’s and LO’s are not bound by this document.     I also realized that trying to influence appraisers has become a near ubiquitous procedure throughout the MB industry but not unheard of with banks.   Any hint of a target value is an influence.  The spirit and intent of appraisal laws and regulations are quite clear. Valuation of real property is clearly not supposed to have any bias. This includes any strike price, special instructions related to value or other contingencies.  For those who might not be aware, the purpose of an appraisal is NOT to encourage a loan origination.  It is used for purposes of risk managment by the lender to prevent over lending on the property.  The very nature of an originator hiring an appraiser is a conflict of interests, since the orignator has a vested interest in a high appraisal.  This is a process which needs change to eliminate the conflict.   Strike values or other “hints” at what is needed only serve the originator and incentivize bad behaviour from unscruptulous appraisers who equate artificially high appraisals with repeat business from originators.  As such, the dictate from regulatory agencies is for appraisers to not consider values for the purposes of “making the deal”.  Value is value and that is what you are hired to do. You are paid for your time and expertise, and not for a result.  That’s the deal.  Who says so?  State and Federal Government. That is who. Feel free to google “USPAP” and read for yourself if any doubts exist.   While I am not an attorney I can only forward a personal opinion that not only is it a violotion of USPAP to accept an appraisal assignment explicitly contingent to minimum value, but also where implicit understandings are in force.  Such an implicit understanding would be where an appraiser is supposed to voluntarily cancel an appraisal where a target value is not met, or by some similar means.   The appraiser, in the eyes of law and regulation, indeed is supposed to value the property. Period. This is reguardless of the outcome.  I would challenge the contention that if the value is below such a figure sufficient to secure a loan, that the appraisal is useless to the borrower.  Indeed it provides the borrower valuable information regarding collateral and equity for the purpose of loan acquisition and allows them to know what their  borrowing limits realistically are.  However, this is off the point a bit, since the message I am trying to get to, is that appraisers do have specific laws and regulations which govern them, and requests for appraisals where performance contingencies exist, place the appraiser in legal jepardy and at risk for license actions. This is what you do not seem to understand, even though you claim to not want place appraisers at risk, you do exactly that.   For one monent, ask yourself why language contained in the HVCC and/or the documents related to Atty General Cuomo’s investigation into Fanie/Freddie specifically referenced, as problems needing reform, the very actions which you proudly perform?  Namely, requests to appraisers for pre-comps, value contingencies for performing appraisals etc.  These deeds are not virtues and are widely held as unethical.  They clearly do not promote appraiser independence and do lead to approval of loans that should not be made. Much of the fallout from these behaviours has contributed to the problems we are experiencing today with unreasonably high loans, upside down equity (although natural market forces have contributed as well), foreclosure and all the rest.   Yes, in my opinion, appraisers who cave to these demands are unethical and in violation of USPAP. And no, I do not believe that the majority of appraisers engage in these behaviours-not by a long shot, alhtough there are no shortage that do.  These folks are ostricized by the greater appraisal community and are identified in the industry as “Skippies” (I do not know where this name came from) as an undignified title to undignified appraisers.  This is exactly why we now have the HVCC looming and eminent, and my guess is that similar regulations will spread rapidly to most non conforming instruments.   Sorry if I have made spelling errors or typos and thanks for the space to speak.   Jeff                    mrkiw  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 2:20 am         Brent………   The fact is: you are a salesperson attempting to make a sale when you decide for yourself, with assistance from your loan client, what a value on a property is (or is needed) before an appraisal is done.   The fact also is: appraisers are supposed to have independence in the valuation process, not influenced by you or others as to the ‘amount needed’ prior to accepting an appraisal assignment.   You need to learn to due more due dilligence yourself by examining a variety of web sites which help to establish ‘approximate values’ on properties.  Those are normally reported in a value range.  If the range contains your target loan amount, then order the appraisal.   If you are employing appraisers who give you a stated value in advance prior to seeing the property, you need to fire them immediately.  They are the worst of our profession.  Similar to you, they have no ethics.                    Hal Pollock  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 6:04 am         Hello Brent;   1st thank you for publishing the comments by appraisers.  I am an appraiser and proud of it.  I don’t care that on any given loan, I make a few hundred $$’s and the MB or LO makes thousands.  No problem, I like what I do, and if I wanted to, I would enter your field.    Please explain how a good honest appraisal report which accurately reports the home value is a waste of money.   The current mess we are in is the result of appraisers inflating value.  Unethical and weak appraisers inflated value in response to the pressure placed on them by commissioned LO’s.  One LO threatened my life when my value came in $15,000 below his expectation on a $310,000 condo.  I am pretty smart, but I can’t see 5% while sitting at my desk.     Regards   Hal                    Joseph  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 6:20 am         “…..I will not waste my time, my clients time and most importantly their money if the value needed to perform the loan is not there.”   And are you hurt in anyway if the value is inflated and the loan works?   How about the homeowner? What’s more costly to them…the appraisal fee or being upside down on their mortgage the day they close?                    Frederick  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 6:22 am         APPRAISER,  Brent wrote that he asks the appraiser to determine the value.  He did not predetermine any value.  You write about laws.  I hope you can read them better than you read Brents post.   Jeff Deutch,  The services requests that Brent wrote about in his opening post would not cause an appraiser to contradict USPAP.  In fact, the board that writes USPAP published a QA in July explaining that appraisers are permitted to provide the services Brent asked for, because apparently too many appraisers cannot figure out what USPAP says.                    appraiser II  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 7:07 am         In some schools of thought you can do comp checks, value checks and what ever else you may want to call it.  But under USPAP you must have a complete work file for the work done and you must meet USPAP standards.  In other words you must do an appraisal.  I my self am not interested in betting on the come, that the value is there and work for nothing.  I have clients that order appraisals reguardless.  The appraisal is an opinion of value and time is money.   I don’t think you would walk in to a doctors office or lawyers office and tell then unless they can cure you or can win you case you are not going to pay them.   Time is money you want a value you will pay for that value or move on to some thing that the dung beetle rolls around.   As far as what is best for your client, in my world that has turned out to be a crock of _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ that loan officers use as a no good reason .  It must make lenders feel good.  More people have been damaged by the good hearted loan officer looking out for thier good.                    Jeff Deuitch  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 8:08 am         Frederick:   You claim that Brent did not predetermine any value.  Then perhaps you can clarify this statement copied from Brent’s original post:   “…When I order an appraisal I need my appraiser to know unless a certain value is there, to not proceed with the appraisal”   And you acuse APPRAISER and myself of not being able to read?  Curious indeed.  Sounds like the appraisal is contingent upon a minimum value to me.  Also, some of the actions which I referenced that fall throught loopholes in USPAP will be addressed in the HVCC.  I certainly am not familiar with any advisories or FAQ’s published by the Appraisal Foundation which allow for the activity quoted above.  However, if such an FAQ exists, I would be interested reading it.   For the record:  Here is the language as copied directly from the draft HVCC located on Attorney General Andrew Cuomo’s web site. Since this language exists in a document used to overhaul Fannie and Freddie and prevent foreclosures and a future repeat of the economic mess we are in today,  I hope you will begin to  understand that these things are IMPORTANT!!   They have been identified as contributing to mortage fraud and creating serious economic problems. To read the entire draft, you can visit:    http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2008/mar/Code%20Final%203-2.pdf   Here is the excerpt describing some prohibited acts for Fannie/Freddie loans:   “…conditioning the ordering of an appraisal report or the payment of an appraisal fee or salary or bonus on the opinion, conclusion, or valuation to be reached, or on a preliminary estimate requested from an appraiser;   5) requesting that an appraiser provide an estimated, predetermined, or desired valuation in an appraisal report, or provide estimated values or comparable sales at any time prior to the appraisers completion of an appraisal report;   6) providing to an appraiser an anticipated, estimated, encouraged, or desired value for a subject property or a proposed or target amount to be loaned to the borrower, except that a copy of the sales contract for purchase transactions may be provided;…….”   Now if doing precomps and targe values are the mark of ‘good” appraisers as idendified by Brent, how come they are being prohibited by the GSE’s which hold or guarantee about half the mortgages in the USA!  Wake up.                    Frederick  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 8:25 am         appraisers II says - In some schools of thought you can do comp checks, value checks and what ever else you may want to call it.  -But under USPAP you must have a complete work file   I’d call them appraisals.  That’s why appraisers can do them.  The fact that appraisers can them is why they need record a work file.  However, USPAP does not say “complete” work file.  Saving the MLS search on the hard drive should be a sufficient record to make a summary report, if that necessary.   This is from the board that writes USPAP.  This is the only “school of thought.”   -  “Question:  Im a residential appraiser and have been asked to perform a comp check (or pre-comp) assignment, where a client wants to get an idea of the value of a home prior to proceeding with a mortgage financing transaction. Does USPAP allow me to perform this type of assignment?  Response:  Yes.”                    Frederick  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 8:46 am         Frederick:  You claim that Brent did not predetermine any value. Then perhaps you can clarify this statement copied from Brents original post:   &When I order an appraisal I need my appraiser to know unless a certain value is there, to not proceed with the appraisal   Jeff,  I don’t know what to clarify.  Brent didn’t tell the appraiser what to say the property is worth.  He aks the appraiser to determine what the property is worth.  That is clear.   Maybe Brent doesn’t know the lingo.  I think he means for the appraiser to do a desktop analysis.  Have the appraiser see if his client is trying to borrow $300,000 with a $200,000 house.  That would be a no-go right there.  But if it looks like a go, then the broker would have the appraiser “proceed” with a NEW inspection type appraisal that banks and investors want, and written up on a GSE form that banks, investors and the secondary market want.   Jeff - “And you acuse APPRAISER and myself of not being able to read? Curious indeed. Sounds like the appraisal is contingent upon a minimum value to me.”  Jeff, he did not write that he tells the appraiser to appraiser the $200,000 house for $300,000.  That’s why you read something into the post that wasn’t there, and the statements that his post describes aksing appraisers to break laws or rules is also wrong.                    Steve  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 10:13 am         Hello Frederick/Brent and others,   I’m also an appraiser. Again, thank you for listening to us. We are trying to tell you that you are creating a dangerous situation for your appraisers and for yourself. Not suggesting that you don’t have your clients best interest at heart. But think all this through.   There is a simple point we as appraisers are trying to make. If a loan officer or originator, says in any form, verbal or written, “I need a certain value to make my borrower’s deal work”, and we as appraisers except the project at any level, we have opened the door to an illegal action that is a violation of USPAP. In providing a pre-comp of any kind, we are indicating a range of value without completing an appraisal. That is also a violation. Plain and simple. We know it is common practice to order an appraisal and then suggest that the borrower thinks my home is worth X. Also here is the amount of the loan for you to considere, Mr. Appraiser. As soon as that happens, ethics regs, etc. say to us as appraisers, “Refuse the assignment, your impartiallity in the process has been compromised. You are not supposed to know those things”.    No matter what you think should be right about telling us to check out the value before going forward, as soon as we call you back and say “Yeah, it looks like it will be there”, we have broken the law because we have agreed to hit the value if we complete the project. That call immediately places an appraiser in violation of USPAP. If we call and say “The value is not there”, then we have also done an appraisal without all the required support. The required support is a completed appraisal that includes looking at the property. If you say, “Go ahead and do the appraisal anyway”, the appraiser still gave a pre-determined value. Also a violation of USPAP. A pre-determined value conclusion, high or low is illegal. End of story.    One solution for you as a mortgage broker, is to call your state appraisal board, talk to them, don’t take our word on this, and ask if what you are hearing here is correct. You will find they are very serious about prosecuting appraisers that do what you are asking. And following through by prosecuting loan officers involved as well.                    loan officer  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 10:20 am         In defense of Brent, he is not trying to do anything unethical in fact he is trying to do just the opposite and not waste his clients time and money.  If instead of requesting an “appraisal” from you with a value needed…  What if he just got a Comp Check from you instead??  Would that be ok?     From there he can take the comp check and make his own decision with his client if it’s worth it to order the actual appraisal.                    Desiree Mehbod  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 10:31 am         Good morning Brent, Loan Officer and Frederick,   The Uniform Standards of Professional Practice (USPAP) do not allow an appraiser to accept an assignment based on a pre-determined value. Standards Rule 2-3, of 2008 USPAP, requires language in each appraisal certification, similar to the following:   My compensation for completing this assignment is not contingent upon the development or reporting of a predetermined value or direction in value that favors the cause of the client, the amount of the value opinion, the attainment or a stipulated result, or the occurrence of a subsequent event directly related to the intended use of this appraisal.  ~ source [http://commerce.appraisalfoundation….s_Rule_2_3.htm]   The Appraisers Certification of Fannie Mae Form 1004/Freddie Mac Form 70 (URAR) rev. 03.2005, page 5 of 6 paragraph no. 18 also states:   My employment and/or compensation for performing this appraisal or any future or anticipated appraisals was not conditioned on any agreement or understanding, written or otherwise, that I would report (or present analysis supporting) a predetermined specific value, a predetermined minimum value, a range or direction in value, a value that favors the cause of any party, or the attainment of a specific result or occurrence of a specific subsequent event (such as approval of a pending mortgage loan application).  ~ source [https://www.efanniemae.com/sf/formsd…trans/1004.pdf]   How would you interpret the above? Please be specific and detailed.   Thank you,  Desiree Mehbod  Real Estate Appraiser                    Frederick  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 10:57 am         Steve, the part I don’t understand is the emphasis on this, “A pre-determined value conclusion, high or low is illegal. End of story.”   End of the story?  It was never part of the story.  Brent didn’t write that he was telling the appraiser what to appraise it for.                    Frederick  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 11:10 am         Desiree writes  -Good morning Brent, Loan Officer and Frederick  -How would you interpret the above? Please be specific and detailed.   The same as what I wrote before.  It’s not relevant because Brent didn’t tell the appraiser a predetermined value to appraise it for.  He wrote about asking appraisers to determine what they think the property is worth and using the best comps.  Payment should be based on the scope of work product.

Just because someone calls an appraisal (point value, range of value, less than or greater than some value, etc.) something else does not make it something else.   And, once again, why is it okay to waste the appraisers time an money, but not waste the borrowers time and money???                    BrentMendelson  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 12:19 pm         Well glad to see people are paying attention!! I think people are hearing what they want to hear and some are coming in with axes to grind. Jeff I don’t think that describes you and thanks again for writing in again. I am just going to respond in general because there was alot of volume over night.  Let me be clear again, I do not want any appraiser to do anything that would get them in trouble, or compromise their independence. No doctoring, no inflated appraisals wanted here. I want an honest assesment.  I think most of what was written here was appraisal whining pure and simple.  It also doesn’t really matter because as of Jan 1, 2009 it looks like the appraisal disaster will be here for unsuspecting borrowers. Thanks to big government a new central bureaucracy will be created by the government to remove ordering appraisals from the hands of the loan officer. It might sound good but my orginal post was more about the dangers that this system will bring to the homeowner. It seems that I touched a nerve on appraisers and I am glad I did. Thanks to those who were trying to help and educate like Jeff, Steve and Desiree. Most of the rest just seem to have an axe to grind against my profession. That’s fine but after reading most of the comments I have lost alot of respect for the appraisal profession in general. I think that appraisers see an easier job next year and not having to be held accountable and to have guaranteed jobs. Sad but true. I think that Andrew Cuomo doesn’t know enough about what he has started and I am sure think that he is “helping” In my opinion creating a huge bureaucracy that will remove appraisers from actually doing a compentent job and being responsive to their clients is not a good idea. I don’t care what you say, this is no doubt where the industry is headed. You will now all be shackled to the namless, faceless government run system that is straight out of Soviet Russia. We always go to extremes in this nation, yes there were bad appraisers, loan officers and banks that broke the rules and people got hurt. Don’t worry we are from the government and here to help. LOL Now to the personal comments.   Jeff and Hal, I want to say answer a few of your comments directly.  An appraisal is only of value to a borrower if it lets them borrow!!!!! I thought this was obvious, everything else is not important if they can’t do what they want. I hear you about Cuomo’s investigation, I just don’t think he was correct in his findings. If he was correct there are many other ways to fix the problems, not destroy the entire way business has been done. Were appraisals getting inflated a problem, 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago???  Elliott Reed, you don’t know anything you discussed in your post by the way. There are many consequences if a loan goes bad for the loan officer. You just rant about a broken system, I say it’s everyone’s fault to a bit, I will not allow you to attack the mortgage industry while you claim your hands are clean.  What a crock.   MRKIW- You are a complete intellectual coward. I am not a salesperson, I don’t sell anything but good service and product knowledge. This goes to all the appraisers that can’t read, I will say it again- I don’t want to compromise your independence, integrity or get you in trouble. Perhaps Frederick had it right, call it a desktop analysis but if you think that to do an appraisal when you know the value isn’t there is morally wrong. Not close, not a maybe but you know you are taking someones money and giving them a pile of worthless paper makes you a greedy, non professional with no integrity.  mrkiw- If you would like a range, then that is fine also but I will not allow you to take your entire profession off the hook by claiming how we bully you and threaten your independence. My appraisers do an excellent job, and have never had their work questioned in hundereds of appraisals for me. You don’t know me so please never again question my ethics.                    BrentMendelson  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 12:24 pm         Hamptons- A comp check is NOT an appraisal, I just called three appraisers for their opinion and they laughed at you. True story man, so after hearing from my guys I don’t take you very seriously. In your defense, just like I say on appraising there seems to be a range of opinions. Some of your fellow appraisers on this blog seem to suggest that a range of value may work and be a compromise. And Steve, Frederick had it right, I never told anyone what they had to hit, I guess you could look at it as the number I placed on the appraisal request was the number I needed to make my loan work. Again, it’s getting really old but if you can’t do it, then don’t do it, I don’t want to break any laws and ask anyone else to do so. Jeez, is that so hard to understand that I would want some idea back from you that you can do what is needed?                    Maureen  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 1:12 pm         Yes, hello, I am a home owner and feel I have gotten caught in the middle of this situation.  I applied for a loan several months ago.  I only owe $168,000 on my mortgage and my house should be worth $195,000.  I am basing this on the fact that it was appraised two years ago for $190,000 - I know my market is very slow now but I have improved the home.  The mortgage broker asked me what I thought it was worth and I told him this.  He said he could help me, I am having some credit problems.   Anyway, the appraiser came to the house .  While he was there I accidently saw his file.. he dropped it and a pile of papers came out.   There was a fax kinda cover sheet and on it was my brokers name address and my address  and down on the bottom was…” You need to hit $228,000″ on this one”     The appraisal came in at I think at $196,000 - about what I thought but the broker will not give me a copy of it.  He then said that he could not give me a loan.    I am not angry at the appraiser at is appears he was honest, what I am angry about was that it appears the mortgage broker was trying to get my house value way up there so HE could close my loan.   I guess he got his tho, as of a few weeks ago the phone number is no longer in service.   I went to my bank and was able to work out my financial situation.   I applaud the honest appraiser.  Your comments here that you only use dishonest appraisers who will hit a number for you say it all!!!!                    Oregon Appraiser  Says:              September 12th, 2008 at 1:14 pm         Perhaps we could step back and take a look at where all the disagreement comes from.  Loan Officers, Appraisers, Underwriters, Lenders all have concerns and rules.  The problem is at the top, the financial rules and regulations that govern each entity and the consequences that ensue if the rules are broken.  In my limited study of these different rules, it has become very clear to me that ‘the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing’.  Each has morphed into a reactionary respons
