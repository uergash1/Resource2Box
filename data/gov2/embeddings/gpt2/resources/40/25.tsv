In addition to writing code, computer programmers are also called on to repair, modify, expand, and update older programs that have already been written.

My goal in this series of articles is for you to understand asset allocation thoroughly, in an easy to understand format.                                                          403b Savings Calculator             Retirement Calculator, Inc.     403bsavingscalculator.com                         What Can You Do With a 403b Savings Calculator?   Those individuals who work for a variety of non-profit agencies, colleges and universities and local governments often have an employer sponsored 403b account rather than a more common 401k. Just as with a 401k, those who have 403b accounts may find that their contributions are matched by their employers or not. Likewise, those who have a 403b account are given choices about how they want to invest, how much they want to invest and whether or not to open additional savings and investment accounts to help them prepare for retirement.       A 403b savings calculator, at its most basic, is a tool that enables those of you with 403b accounts to see how much the money that you've put into the account is earning for you. A  403b savings calculator  lets you take a closer look at your investments than you are able to do simply by looking at the statement that you receive that's meant to tell you how your account is doing.    However,  a 403b savings  calculator should do more than just let you see what is there in your account and provide you with some idea about how your  money will continue to grow over time. With the  right 403b savings calculator, you should be able to:  Look at the amount that you are contributing and determine how much of a difference a greater contribution per pay period would make in your retirement saving;  Look at the different mutual funds and stock options that you have for investing to see whether or not you would benefit by investing your 403b savings differently;  Experiment with your savings and investment strategy to see whether or not you are investing as well as you could be;  Consider the past and projected performance of the stocks and mutual funds that are available to you;  Better understand the risk that you are taking when you choose one investment over another.       Additionally, if not all of your retirement planning is being done with your 403b, you're probably going to want something more than a basic  403b savings calculator  - something like the retirement calculator you can download on this page that will allow you to do everything that you need to in order to understand your 403b savings as well as all of your other retirement savings and investment accounts.   Not only does the retirement calculator allow you to get a feel for your accounts on your own, but when you download it your contact information will be forwarded to a financial advisor in your area who will call to follow up and answer any questions that you have. In other words, you won't just get a  403b savings calculator  or a retirement calculator, you will also get the chance to talk about your goals and options with someone who can help you to develop a better strategy - a plan for reaching all of your goals, whatever they may be.   Does the  403b savings calculator you've been using do all of that?

Analysis of the Economics of Early Social Security Withdrawal    Robert J. Phillips    Chief Retirement Consultant   Deciding whether or not to take the early withdrawal of social security at age 62 can be difficult. If you need this income at 62 to fund your retirement the decision is fairly straightforward. Take it early!  On the other hand, if you have another source of revenue to fund your retirement your decision will be primarily based on lifestyle, health and investment preferences.   Several factors can affect your decision. First is your life expectancy. If you are in good health and have a family history of living beyond 90 then waiting for full benefits may be best. Two other factors impact this decision. First and most important is the value of money or your expected return from your investments. If you are using other investments instead of social security to fund your retirement you should use the rate of return of these investments as your value of money. There is another way to look at the value of money. If you do not require the social security money to live, you can invest the distributions for the future. The rate of return of this investment is your value of money. If your investments will make larger returns such as stocks this would favor taking the early withdrawal.   The last factor impacting your decision is inflation. Social security includes an annual adjustment based on inflation. You cannot control this variable but you should be aware of its impact. If future inflation is significant it will favor a later full distribution    FREE Social Security Calculator:   Find Out Your Breakeven Age   We developed a calculator to assist in analyzing the impact of taking early benefits at age 62 or waiting for full benefits at age 66 to 67 depending on the year you were born...If you were born in 1960 or later your full benefits will begin at age 67 and your reduction for early benefits at age 62 will be 30%. If you were born between 1946 and 1960 your full benefits begin as early as age 66. We have included a chart that summarizes information.   To use the calculator you need to input your year of birth. You also need to input a value of money up to 10% and a projected inflation adjustment. The calculator analyzes income generated over time from both the early and full benefit investments. It calculates the age at which full social security will catch up and breakeven with the early withdrawal. If you were born before 1960 your breakeven age will be impacted by the year you were born. An early breakeven age favors waiting for full benefits.   The social security calculator is not the final answer whether to take an early withdrawal but it does give you additional economic data to assist in that decision. Ultimately you must balance income, investments and lifestyle to optimize your enjoyment during your retirement years.                                     © Copyright 2008 Retirement Calculator, Inc.

It affords the couple most of ""the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law..."" as married spouses.  [ 1 ]   Enacted in 1999, the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the  United States  created by a legislature without court intervention. Initially, domestic partnerships enjoyed very few privilegesprincipally just hospital-visitation rights. The  legislature  has since expanded the scope of California domestic partnerships to afford many of the rights and responsibilities common to marriage. As such, it is now difficult to distinguish California  domestic partnerships  from  civil unions  offered in a handful of other states.   Although the program enjoys broad support in California, [ 2 ]  it has been the source of some controversy. Groups opposed to the recognition of same-sex families have challenged the expansion of domestic partnerships in court. Conversely, advocates of  same-sex marriage  contend that anything less than full marriage rights extended to same-sex partners is analogous to the ""separate but equal"" racial laws of the Jim Crow era.

Consult the  California Secretary of State  for the most current information. [3]     [ edit ]   Scope   As of 2007, California affords domestic partnerships most of the same rights and responsibilities as marriages under state law (Cal. Fam. Code 297.5). Among these:     Making health care decisions for each other in certain circumstances   Hospital and jail visitation rights that were previously reserved for family members related by blood, adoption or marriage to the sick, injured or incarcerated person.   Access to family health insurance plans (Cal. Ins. Code 10121.7)   Spousal insurance policies (auto, life, homeowners etc..), this applies to all forms of insurance through the  California Insurance Equality Act  (Cal. Ins. Code 381.5)   Sick care and similar family leave   Stepparent adoption procedures   Presumption that both members of the partnership are the parents of a child born into the partnership   Suing for wrongful death of a domestic partner   Rights involving wills, intestate succession, conservatorships and trusts   The same property tax provisions otherwise available only to married couples (Cal. R&T Code 62p)   Access to some survivor pension benefits   Supervision of the  Superior Court of California  over dissolution and nullity proceedings   The obligation to file  state tax returns as a married couple (260k)  commencing with the 2007 tax year (Cal R&T Code 18521d)   The right for either partner to take the other partner's surname after registration   Community property rights and responsibilities previously only available to married spouses   The right to request partner support (alimony) upon dissolution of the partnership (divorce)   The same parental rights and responsibilities granted to and imposed upon spouses in a marriage       [ edit ]   Differences from Marriage   While domestic partners receive most of the benefits of marriage, several differences remain. These differences include, in part:     Couples seeking domestic partnership must already share a residence, married couples may be married without living together.   Couples seeking domestic partnership must be 18 or older, minors can be married before the age of 18 with the consent of their parents.   California permits married couples the option of  confidential marriage,  there is no equivalent institution for domestic partnerships. In confidential marriages, no witnesses are required and the marriage license is not a matter of public record.   Married partners of state employees are eligible for the  CalPERS  long-term care insurance plan, domestic partners are not.   There is, at least according to one appellate ruling, no equivalent of the  Putative Spouse Doctrine  for domestic partnerships.  [ 3 ]     In addition to these differences specific to state law, should the  Defense of Marriage Act  be found unconstitutional or repealed, married persons in California might enjoy all the federal benefits of marriage, including Constitutionally-required recognition of their relationships as marriages in the rest of the United States under the  Full Faith and Credit  Clause. [ citation needed ]   In addition to these differences specific to the United States, some countries that recognize same-sex marriages performed in California as valid in their own country, (e.g., Israel  [4] ), do not recognize same-sex domestic partnerships performed in California.   Many supporters of same-sex marriage also argue that the use of the word marriage itself constitutes a significant social difference, [ citation needed ]  and in the majority opinion of  In Re Marriage Cases , the California Supreme Court agreed,  [ 4 ]  suggesting an analogy with a hypothetical that branded interracial marriages ""transracial unions"".     [ edit ]   Eligibility   Currently, a couple that wishes to register must meet the following requirements:     Both persons have a common residence.   Neither person is married to someone else or is a member of another domestic partnership with someone else that has not been terminated, dissolved, or adjudged a nullity.   The two persons are not related by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in  California .   Both persons are at least 18 years of age.   Either of the following:    Both persons are members of the same sex.   The partners are of the opposite sex, one or both of whom is above the age of 62, and one or both of whom meet specified eligibility requirements under the Social Security Act.       Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership.            Example of California domestic partnership certificate.       Also, a legal union of a same-sex couple, other than  marriage , validly performed in another jurisdiction, that is substantially equivalent to a  California  domestic partnership, will be recognized as such in California.  Civil unions , such as those performed in  Vermont ,  Connecticut , and  New Jersey , would most likely qualify as domestic partnerships in  California . A valid same-sex marriage performed in a jurisdiction that recognizes such unions, such as  Massachusetts , would not be recognized in California as either a marriage or a domestic partnership. This is due to the fact that  California statute  prohibits recognition of another jurisdiction's validly performed same-sex marriage.   British law  recognizes California domestic partnerships as equivalent to  civil partnerships  in the  United Kingdom . The attorney general of  New Jersey  has ruled that California domestic partnerships are equivalent to civil unions in that state and likewise that civil unions in New Jersey can qualify as domestic partnerships in California.  Switzerland  recognizes California domestic partnerships as comparable to  Civil unions in Switzerland , including granting residency rights based on the partnership.     [ edit ]   Registration   Domestic partner registration is an uncomplicated process, more simple and less costly than entering into a marriage. Both parties must sign a declaration listing their names and address. Both signatures must be notarized. The declaration must then be transmitted to the Secretary of State along with a $10 filing fee (plus an additional $23 fee for same sex couples must be collected pursuant to CA Family Codes 298, 298.5 and 358, to help fund LGBT-specific domestic violence training and services). In this regard it is not like a marriage or civil union. Those unions require a ceremony, solemnized by either religious clergy or civil officials, to be deemed valid.     [ edit ]   Dissolution   In most cases, a domestic partnership must be dissolved through filing a court action identical to an action for dissolution of marriage. In limited circumstances, however, a filing with the Secretary of State may suffice. This procedure is available when the domestic partnership has not been in force for more than five years. The couple must also meet many other requirements that the dissolution be both simple and uncontested: no children (or current pregnancy) within the relationship, no real estate (including certain leases), and little joint property or debt. The parties must also review materials prepared by the Secretary of State, execute an agreement dividing assets and liability, and waive claims to domestic partner support. Where all the requirements are met, the partnership will terminate six months after the filing, unless either party revokes consent.     [ edit ]   Legislative history     [ edit ]   Attempts at the Municipal Level   In 1982, the  San Francisco Board of Supervisors  passed a measure to extend health insurance coverage to domestic partners of public employees, but did not provide for a registry available to the general public. Mayor  Dianne Feinstein  vetoed the measure. [ 5 ]  Eventually San Francisco enacted a similar measure, as did other communities, such as Berkeley, and some local agencies.   In 1984 the City of Berkeley was the first city to pass a domestic partner policy for city and school district employees. This followed a year of work by the Domestic Partner Task Force chaired by Leland Traiman. Working with the Task Force was Tom Brougham, a Berkeley city employee who coined the term ""domestic partner"" and created the concept. All other domestic partner policies are patterned after Berkeley's.   In 1985,  West Hollywood  became the first U.S. city to enact a domestic partnership registry open to the citizenry. Eventually other cities, including San Francisco, Berkeley, and Santa Cruz, followed suit. [ 6 ]   Despite successes in a handful of localities, supporters of legal recognition same-sex couples could not overcome the limited geographical scope and relatively modest range of programs administered at the county and city level. In the 1990s, they turned their attention the state legislature.     [ edit ]   Early attempts in the state legislature   Mirroring the experience of Californias local efforts, the state legislature did not initially succeed in providing health insurance coverage for domestic partners or creating a domestic partner registry for the general public.     Assembly Bill 627 of 1995:  In 1995, Assemblymember Richard Katz introduced a bill to create a domestic partner registry, open to both same- and opposite-sex couples. It sought to provide limited rights in medical decision making, conservatorships and a few related matters. It died in committee.  [ 7 ]   Murray-Katz Domestic Partnership Act of 1997:  At the beginning of the 19971998 legislative session Assemblymember Kevin Murray introduced Assembly Bill 54. It was similar to Assembly Bill 627 of 1995. After successfully negotiating two Assembly committees, Murray did not bring the bill to a vote on the Assembly floor. [ 8 ]   Assembly Bill 1059 of 1997:  In 1997, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced a bill that would require health insurance companies to offer for sale policies that would cover domestic partners of the insured, but did not require employers to provide the coverage. As later amended, it required employers who cover employees dependents to cover their domestic partners as well. The amended bill eventually gained approval of the legislature, but Governor  Pete Wilson  vetoed the measure. [ 9 ]   Domestic Partnership Act of 1999:  Kevin Murray, now a state senator, introduced Senate Bill 75 in December 1998. It was largely identical to his Assembly Bill 54 of 1997 and ultimately passed both houses of the state legislature. Governor  Gray Davis  vetoed the bill in favor of Assembly Bill 26, which was narrower in scope. [ 10 ]       [ edit ]   Establishment and incremental expansion     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 26 of 1999   Simultaneously with the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced Assembly Bill 26 of 1999. As originally drafted, it covered all adult couples, like its unsuccessful senate counterpart. Before bringing the bill to the Assembly floor, however, Migden narrowed its scope. Based on objections from Governor  Gray Davis , who did not want a competing alternative to marriage for opposite-sex couples, Migden eliminated coverage for opposite-sex couples where either participant less than 62 years of age. The bill passed, and Davis signed into law on September 22, 1999. It provided for a public registry, hospital visitation rights, and authorized health insurance coverage for domestic partners of public employees. [ 11 ]  While modest in scope, Assembly Bill 26 marked the first time a state legislature created a domestic partnership statute without the intervention of the courts. (Hawaiis legislature enacted a more expansive  reciprocal beneficiaries  scheme in 1997 in response to an unfavorable lower court ruling; Vermont enacted a sweeping  civil union  bill in 2000 at the direction of its state Supreme Court.)     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 25 of 2001   In the first successful expansion of the domestic partnership act, Assemblymembers  Carole Migden  and  Robert Hertzberg , joined by state Senator  Sheila Kuehl , introduced a bill that added 18 new rights to the domestic partnership scheme. It also relaxed the requirements for opposite-sex couples, requiring only one of the participants to be over 62 years of age. The expanded rights included standing to sue (for emotional distress or wrongful death), stepparent adoption, a variety of conservatorship rights, the right to make health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, certain rights regarding distribution of a deceased partners estate, limited taxpayer rights, sick leave to care for partners, and unemployment and disability insurance benefits. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on October 22, 2001. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Other bills in the 20012002 legislative session   During the 20012002 session, California enacted five more bills making minor changes:     Senate Bill 1049  ( Speier ) permitted  San Mateo County  to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 13 ]   Assembly Bill 2216  ( Keeley ) provided for  intestate succession . [ 14 ]   Assembly Bill 2777  ( Nation ) authorized  Los Angeles ,  Santa Barbara  and  Marin  counties to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 15 ]   Senate Bill 1575  (Sher) exempts domestic partners from certain provisions voiding wills that they helped draft. [ 16 ]   Senate Bill 1661  ( Kuehl ) extends temporary disability benefits to workers to take time off to care for a family member. [ 17 ]       [ edit ]   Wholesale expansion   The introduction of  The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003  (or  Assembly Bill 205 of 2003 ) marked a major shift in the legislatures approach to domestic partnerships. Earlier efforts afforded domestic partners only certain enumerated rights, which the legislature expanded in piecemeal fashion. This bill, introduced by Assemblymembers  Jackie Goldberg ,  Christine Kehoe ,  Paul Koretz ,  John Laird , and  Mark Leno , created the presumption that domestic partners were to have all of the rights and responsibilities afforded spouses under state law. The bill did carve out certain exceptions to this premise, principally involving the creation and dissolution of domestic partnerships and certain tax issues. It also, for the first time, recognized similar relationships, such as  civil unions , created in other states. Because the legislation dramatically changed the circumstances of existing domestic partnerships, the legislature directed the  Secretary of State  to inform all previously registered domestic partnerships of the changes and delayed the effect of the law for an additional year, until January 1, 2005. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on September 19, 2003.  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Subsequent changes and clarifications   Since enacting The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, the legislature has passed several bills aimed at clarifying how certain spousal provisions should be treated in the context of domestic partnerships and made some modest changes. The legislation signed by  Governor   Arnold Schwarzenegger  includes:     Assembly Bill 2208 of 2004  ( Kehoe ) clarifies that health and disability-insurance providers must treat domestic partners the same as married spouses. [ 19 ]   Senate Bill 565 of 2005  ( Migden ) allows transfer of property between domestic partners without reassessment for tax purposes. [ 20 ]   Senate Bill 973 of 2005  ( Kuehl ) specifies that domestic partners of state workers are entitled to retroactive pension benefits, even if the worker entered retirement before the enactment of Assembly Bill 205. [ 21 ]   Senate Bill 1827 of 2006  ( Migden ) requires domestic partners to file state income-tax returns under the same status as married couples (jointly or married filing separately), effective in the 2007 tax year. [ 22 ]   Assembly Bill 2051 of 2006  (Cohn) creates programs and funding grants to reduce domestic violence in the  LGBT  community and increases the fee for registering a domestic partnership by $23 to fund these services. The new fees are effective January 1, 2007. [ 23 ]   Assembly Bill 102 of 2007  ( Ma ) allows parties to a registered domestic partnership to legally change their name to include the last name of their partner.  [ 24 ]       [ edit ]   Popular opinion   California public opinion has long supported legal protections for gay and lesbian couples. In early 1997, two and half years before any statewide recognition occurred, polls showed two-thirds of Californians supported the limited provisions in unsuccessful bills debated in the legislature at the time. There was also strong support (59 percent) for broader provisions (pension, health, leave and survivor benefits) that werent enacted until more than four years later. [ 25 ]   Polls consistently show a marked contrast between support for domestic partnerships and  same-sex marriage . In 1997, roughly 38 percent of Californians supported same-sex marriage. More recent polls show an increase in support for same-sex marriage, but few polls suggest that there is any more support for same-sex marriage than a statistical tie with opponents. [ 26 ]  On November 4, 2008, Californians voted, 52.2% to 47.8%, to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Challenges to domestic partnerships   Despite broad support, Californias domestic partnership program has engendered opposition.     [ edit ]   Referendum   California law provides for  referendums , petition drives that would place any legislative enactment on the ballot for review. Following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, state senator  William Pete Knight  (author of the successful  Proposition 22  initiative) and Assemblymember  Ray Haynes  sought put the new legislation to a popular vote. The referendum failed to qualify for the ballot. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Litigation   Opponents of legal recognition for same-sex couples  filed two lawsuits in the  Superior Court of California . In the first case, state senator  William Pete Knight  sued Governor  Gray Davis  (later substituting Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger ) on the grounds that A.B. 205 impermissibly amended  Proposition 22 , which Knight authored. Randy Thomasson (an opponent of gay rights and head of the Campaign for California Families) filed a similar lawsuit, which challenged both A.B. 205 and the earlier domestic-partner expansion in A.B. 25. Both lawsuits, consolidated into a single action, failed at the trial and appellate courts. In the wake of those decisions, opponents of legal recognition for LGBT families launched at least two recall efforts against Judge Loren McMaster, who presided over the trial-court hearings. The recall efforts also failed. [ 29 ]   Along similar legal lines, defendants in a  wrongful-death action  brought by the survivor of a domestic partnership mounted a defense based partly on the ground that the legislative enactments giving a domestic partner standing to sue for wrongful death ran afoul of Proposition 22 (among other defenses). That defense failed on appeal. [ 30 ]       Main article:  California Proposition 22 (2000)       Proponents of same-sex marriage,  including the City and County of  San Francisco , have challenged the states opposite-sex marriage requirements on constitutional grounds. In pursuing these claims, the plaintiffs argue that even the broad protections of Californias domestic partnership scheme constitute a separate but unequal discriminatory framework. In May 2008, the  Supreme Court of California  ruled in their favor in  In re Marriage Cases , overruling Proposition 22 and effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in California.       Main article:  Same-sex marriage in California         [ edit ]   Constitutional amendments   Immediately following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, a petition drive began to amend the  California Constitution  to forbid any recognitionincluding domestic partnershipsof  LBGT  relationships. [ 31 ]  The measure failed to qualify for the ballot.   For a month in early 2004,  San Francisco issued marriage licenses  to same-sex couples. The  Supreme Court of California  halted that process and later declared the marriages void. Regardless, four separate groups began petition drives to amend the California Constitution to prevent same-sex marriage and repeal domestic-partnership rights. [ 32 ]  The renewed efforts peaked in 2005, [ 33 ]  but have continued since. These groups have filed a total of 20 petitions, but none of the proposed amendments have qualified for the ballot. [ 34 ]   In 2008, two of these groups moved [ 35 ]  to qualify  ballot initiatives  to  amend  the  California Constitution  on the November 2008 ballot. One qualified as  Proposition 8 . The amendment eliminates the right of same-sex couples to marry, but does not repeal any rights granted to domestic partnerships and registration for domestic partnerships remains legal in California. [ 36 ]  In late 2008, Proposition 8 was passed by the voters, and its legality is now the subject of lawsuits in the California Supreme Court.

It affords the couple most of ""the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law..."" as married spouses.  [ 1 ]   Enacted in 1999, the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the  United States  created by a legislature without court intervention. Initially, domestic partnerships enjoyed very few privilegesprincipally just hospital-visitation rights. The  legislature  has since expanded the scope of California domestic partnerships to afford many of the rights and responsibilities common to marriage. As such, it is now difficult to distinguish California  domestic partnerships  from  civil unions  offered in a handful of other states.   Although the program enjoys broad support in California, [ 2 ]  it has been the source of some controversy. Groups opposed to the recognition of same-sex families have challenged the expansion of domestic partnerships in court. Conversely, advocates of  same-sex marriage  contend that anything less than full marriage rights extended to same-sex partners is analogous to the ""separate but equal"" racial laws of the Jim Crow era.

Consult the  California Secretary of State  for the most current information. [3]     [ edit ]   Scope   As of 2007, California affords domestic partnerships most of the same rights and responsibilities as marriages under state law (Cal. Fam. Code 297.5). Among these:     Making health care decisions for each other in certain circumstances   Hospital and jail visitation rights that were previously reserved for family members related by blood, adoption or marriage to the sick, injured or incarcerated person.   Access to family health insurance plans (Cal. Ins. Code 10121.7)   Spousal insurance policies (auto, life, homeowners etc..), this applies to all forms of insurance through the  California Insurance Equality Act  (Cal. Ins. Code 381.5)   Sick care and similar family leave   Stepparent adoption procedures   Presumption that both members of the partnership are the parents of a child born into the partnership   Suing for wrongful death of a domestic partner   Rights involving wills, intestate succession, conservatorships and trusts   The same property tax provisions otherwise available only to married couples (Cal. R&T Code 62p)   Access to some survivor pension benefits   Supervision of the  Superior Court of California  over dissolution and nullity proceedings   The obligation to file  state tax returns as a married couple (260k)  commencing with the 2007 tax year (Cal R&T Code 18521d)   The right for either partner to take the other partner's surname after registration   Community property rights and responsibilities previously only available to married spouses   The right to request partner support (alimony) upon dissolution of the partnership (divorce)   The same parental rights and responsibilities granted to and imposed upon spouses in a marriage       [ edit ]   Differences from Marriage   While domestic partners receive most of the benefits of marriage, several differences remain. These differences include, in part:     Couples seeking domestic partnership must already share a residence, married couples may be married without living together.   Couples seeking domestic partnership must be 18 or older, minors can be married before the age of 18 with the consent of their parents.   California permits married couples the option of  confidential marriage,  there is no equivalent institution for domestic partnerships. In confidential marriages, no witnesses are required and the marriage license is not a matter of public record.   Married partners of state employees are eligible for the  CalPERS  long-term care insurance plan, domestic partners are not.   There is, at least according to one appellate ruling, no equivalent of the  Putative Spouse Doctrine  for domestic partnerships.  [ 3 ]     In addition to these differences specific to state law, should the  Defense of Marriage Act  be found unconstitutional or repealed, married persons in California might enjoy all the federal benefits of marriage, including Constitutionally-required recognition of their relationships as marriages in the rest of the United States under the  Full Faith and Credit  Clause. [ citation needed ]   In addition to these differences specific to the United States, some countries that recognize same-sex marriages performed in California as valid in their own country, (e.g., Israel  [4] ), do not recognize same-sex domestic partnerships performed in California.   Many supporters of same-sex marriage also argue that the use of the word marriage itself constitutes a significant social difference, [ citation needed ]  and in the majority opinion of  In Re Marriage Cases , the California Supreme Court agreed,  [ 4 ]  suggesting an analogy with a hypothetical that branded interracial marriages ""transracial unions"".     [ edit ]   Eligibility   Currently, a couple that wishes to register must meet the following requirements:     Both persons have a common residence.   Neither person is married to someone else or is a member of another domestic partnership with someone else that has not been terminated, dissolved, or adjudged a nullity.   The two persons are not related by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in  California .   Both persons are at least 18 years of age.   Either of the following:    Both persons are members of the same sex.   The partners are of the opposite sex, one or both of whom is above the age of 62, and one or both of whom meet specified eligibility requirements under the Social Security Act.       Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership.            Example of California domestic partnership certificate.       Also, a legal union of a same-sex couple, other than  marriage , validly performed in another jurisdiction, that is substantially equivalent to a  California  domestic partnership, will be recognized as such in California.  Civil unions , such as those performed in  Vermont ,  Connecticut , and  New Jersey , would most likely qualify as domestic partnerships in  California . A valid same-sex marriage performed in a jurisdiction that recognizes such unions, such as  Massachusetts , would not be recognized in California as either a marriage or a domestic partnership. This is due to the fact that  California statute  prohibits recognition of another jurisdiction's validly performed same-sex marriage.   British law  recognizes California domestic partnerships as equivalent to  civil partnerships  in the  United Kingdom . The attorney general of  New Jersey  has ruled that California domestic partnerships are equivalent to civil unions in that state and likewise that civil unions in New Jersey can qualify as domestic partnerships in California.  Switzerland  recognizes California domestic partnerships as comparable to  Civil unions in Switzerland , including granting residency rights based on the partnership.     [ edit ]   Registration   Domestic partner registration is an uncomplicated process, more simple and less costly than entering into a marriage. Both parties must sign a declaration listing their names and address. Both signatures must be notarized. The declaration must then be transmitted to the Secretary of State along with a $10 filing fee (plus an additional $23 fee for same sex couples must be collected pursuant to CA Family Codes 298, 298.5 and 358, to help fund LGBT-specific domestic violence training and services). In this regard it is not like a marriage or civil union. Those unions require a ceremony, solemnized by either religious clergy or civil officials, to be deemed valid.     [ edit ]   Dissolution   In most cases, a domestic partnership must be dissolved through filing a court action identical to an action for dissolution of marriage. In limited circumstances, however, a filing with the Secretary of State may suffice. This procedure is available when the domestic partnership has not been in force for more than five years. The couple must also meet many other requirements that the dissolution be both simple and uncontested: no children (or current pregnancy) within the relationship, no real estate (including certain leases), and little joint property or debt. The parties must also review materials prepared by the Secretary of State, execute an agreement dividing assets and liability, and waive claims to domestic partner support. Where all the requirements are met, the partnership will terminate six months after the filing, unless either party revokes consent.     [ edit ]   Legislative history     [ edit ]   Attempts at the Municipal Level   In 1982, the  San Francisco Board of Supervisors  passed a measure to extend health insurance coverage to domestic partners of public employees, but did not provide for a registry available to the general public. Mayor  Dianne Feinstein  vetoed the measure. [ 5 ]  Eventually San Francisco enacted a similar measure, as did other communities, such as Berkeley, and some local agencies.   In 1984 the City of Berkeley was the first city to pass a domestic partner policy for city and school district employees. This followed a year of work by the Domestic Partner Task Force chaired by Leland Traiman. Working with the Task Force was Tom Brougham, a Berkeley city employee who coined the term ""domestic partner"" and created the concept. All other domestic partner policies are patterned after Berkeley's.   In 1985,  West Hollywood  became the first U.S. city to enact a domestic partnership registry open to the citizenry. Eventually other cities, including San Francisco, Berkeley, and Santa Cruz, followed suit. [ 6 ]   Despite successes in a handful of localities, supporters of legal recognition same-sex couples could not overcome the limited geographical scope and relatively modest range of programs administered at the county and city level. In the 1990s, they turned their attention the state legislature.     [ edit ]   Early attempts in the state legislature   Mirroring the experience of Californias local efforts, the state legislature did not initially succeed in providing health insurance coverage for domestic partners or creating a domestic partner registry for the general public.     Assembly Bill 627 of 1995:  In 1995, Assemblymember Richard Katz introduced a bill to create a domestic partner registry, open to both same- and opposite-sex couples. It sought to provide limited rights in medical decision making, conservatorships and a few related matters. It died in committee.  [ 7 ]   Murray-Katz Domestic Partnership Act of 1997:  At the beginning of the 19971998 legislative session Assemblymember Kevin Murray introduced Assembly Bill 54. It was similar to Assembly Bill 627 of 1995. After successfully negotiating two Assembly committees, Murray did not bring the bill to a vote on the Assembly floor. [ 8 ]   Assembly Bill 1059 of 1997:  In 1997, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced a bill that would require health insurance companies to offer for sale policies that would cover domestic partners of the insured, but did not require employers to provide the coverage. As later amended, it required employers who cover employees dependents to cover their domestic partners as well. The amended bill eventually gained approval of the legislature, but Governor  Pete Wilson  vetoed the measure. [ 9 ]   Domestic Partnership Act of 1999:  Kevin Murray, now a state senator, introduced Senate Bill 75 in December 1998. It was largely identical to his Assembly Bill 54 of 1997 and ultimately passed both houses of the state legislature. Governor  Gray Davis  vetoed the bill in favor of Assembly Bill 26, which was narrower in scope. [ 10 ]       [ edit ]   Establishment and incremental expansion     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 26 of 1999   Simultaneously with the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced Assembly Bill 26 of 1999. As originally drafted, it covered all adult couples, like its unsuccessful senate counterpart. Before bringing the bill to the Assembly floor, however, Migden narrowed its scope. Based on objections from Governor  Gray Davis , who did not want a competing alternative to marriage for opposite-sex couples, Migden eliminated coverage for opposite-sex couples where either participant less than 62 years of age. The bill passed, and Davis signed into law on September 22, 1999. It provided for a public registry, hospital visitation rights, and authorized health insurance coverage for domestic partners of public employees. [ 11 ]  While modest in scope, Assembly Bill 26 marked the first time a state legislature created a domestic partnership statute without the intervention of the courts. (Hawaiis legislature enacted a more expansive  reciprocal beneficiaries  scheme in 1997 in response to an unfavorable lower court ruling; Vermont enacted a sweeping  civil union  bill in 2000 at the direction of its state Supreme Court.)     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 25 of 2001   In the first successful expansion of the domestic partnership act, Assemblymembers  Carole Migden  and  Robert Hertzberg , joined by state Senator  Sheila Kuehl , introduced a bill that added 18 new rights to the domestic partnership scheme. It also relaxed the requirements for opposite-sex couples, requiring only one of the participants to be over 62 years of age. The expanded rights included standing to sue (for emotional distress or wrongful death), stepparent adoption, a variety of conservatorship rights, the right to make health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, certain rights regarding distribution of a deceased partners estate, limited taxpayer rights, sick leave to care for partners, and unemployment and disability insurance benefits. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on October 22, 2001. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Other bills in the 20012002 legislative session   During the 20012002 session, California enacted five more bills making minor changes:     Senate Bill 1049  ( Speier ) permitted  San Mateo County  to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 13 ]   Assembly Bill 2216  ( Keeley ) provided for  intestate succession . [ 14 ]   Assembly Bill 2777  ( Nation ) authorized  Los Angeles ,  Santa Barbara  and  Marin  counties to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 15 ]   Senate Bill 1575  (Sher) exempts domestic partners from certain provisions voiding wills that they helped draft. [ 16 ]   Senate Bill 1661  ( Kuehl ) extends temporary disability benefits to workers to take time off to care for a family member. [ 17 ]       [ edit ]   Wholesale expansion   The introduction of  The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003  (or  Assembly Bill 205 of 2003 ) marked a major shift in the legislatures approach to domestic partnerships. Earlier efforts afforded domestic partners only certain enumerated rights, which the legislature expanded in piecemeal fashion. This bill, introduced by Assemblymembers  Jackie Goldberg ,  Christine Kehoe ,  Paul Koretz ,  John Laird , and  Mark Leno , created the presumption that domestic partners were to have all of the rights and responsibilities afforded spouses under state law. The bill did carve out certain exceptions to this premise, principally involving the creation and dissolution of domestic partnerships and certain tax issues. It also, for the first time, recognized similar relationships, such as  civil unions , created in other states. Because the legislation dramatically changed the circumstances of existing domestic partnerships, the legislature directed the  Secretary of State  to inform all previously registered domestic partnerships of the changes and delayed the effect of the law for an additional year, until January 1, 2005. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on September 19, 2003.  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Subsequent changes and clarifications   Since enacting The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, the legislature has passed several bills aimed at clarifying how certain spousal provisions should be treated in the context of domestic partnerships and made some modest changes. The legislation signed by  Governor   Arnold Schwarzenegger  includes:     Assembly Bill 2208 of 2004  ( Kehoe ) clarifies that health and disability-insurance providers must treat domestic partners the same as married spouses. [ 19 ]   Senate Bill 565 of 2005  ( Migden ) allows transfer of property between domestic partners without reassessment for tax purposes. [ 20 ]   Senate Bill 973 of 2005  ( Kuehl ) specifies that domestic partners of state workers are entitled to retroactive pension benefits, even if the worker entered retirement before the enactment of Assembly Bill 205. [ 21 ]   Senate Bill 1827 of 2006  ( Migden ) requires domestic partners to file state income-tax returns under the same status as married couples (jointly or married filing separately), effective in the 2007 tax year. [ 22 ]   Assembly Bill 2051 of 2006  (Cohn) creates programs and funding grants to reduce domestic violence in the  LGBT  community and increases the fee for registering a domestic partnership by $23 to fund these services. The new fees are effective January 1, 2007. [ 23 ]   Assembly Bill 102 of 2007  ( Ma ) allows parties to a registered domestic partnership to legally change their name to include the last name of their partner.  [ 24 ]       [ edit ]   Popular opinion   California public opinion has long supported legal protections for gay and lesbian couples. In early 1997, two and half years before any statewide recognition occurred, polls showed two-thirds of Californians supported the limited provisions in unsuccessful bills debated in the legislature at the time. There was also strong support (59 percent) for broader provisions (pension, health, leave and survivor benefits) that werent enacted until more than four years later. [ 25 ]   Polls consistently show a marked contrast between support for domestic partnerships and  same-sex marriage . In 1997, roughly 38 percent of Californians supported same-sex marriage. More recent polls show an increase in support for same-sex marriage, but few polls suggest that there is any more support for same-sex marriage than a statistical tie with opponents. [ 26 ]  On November 4, 2008, Californians voted, 52.2% to 47.8%, to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Challenges to domestic partnerships   Despite broad support, Californias domestic partnership program has engendered opposition.     [ edit ]   Referendum   California law provides for  referendums , petition drives that would place any legislative enactment on the ballot for review. Following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, state senator  William Pete Knight  (author of the successful  Proposition 22  initiative) and Assemblymember  Ray Haynes  sought put the new legislation to a popular vote. The referendum failed to qualify for the ballot. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Litigation   Opponents of legal recognition for same-sex couples  filed two lawsuits in the  Superior Court of California . In the first case, state senator  William Pete Knight  sued Governor  Gray Davis  (later substituting Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger ) on the grounds that A.B. 205 impermissibly amended  Proposition 22 , which Knight authored. Randy Thomasson (an opponent of gay rights and head of the Campaign for California Families) filed a similar lawsuit, which challenged both A.B. 205 and the earlier domestic-partner expansion in A.B. 25. Both lawsuits, consolidated into a single action, failed at the trial and appellate courts. In the wake of those decisions, opponents of legal recognition for LGBT families launched at least two recall efforts against Judge Loren McMaster, who presided over the trial-court hearings. The recall efforts also failed. [ 29 ]   Along similar legal lines, defendants in a  wrongful-death action  brought by the survivor of a domestic partnership mounted a defense based partly on the ground that the legislative enactments giving a domestic partner standing to sue for wrongful death ran afoul of Proposition 22 (among other defenses). That defense failed on appeal. [ 30 ]       Main article:  California Proposition 22 (2000)       Proponents of same-sex marriage,  including the City and County of  San Francisco , have challenged the states opposite-sex marriage requirements on constitutional grounds. In pursuing these claims, the plaintiffs argue that even the broad protections of Californias domestic partnership scheme constitute a separate but unequal discriminatory framework. In May 2008, the  Supreme Court of California  ruled in their favor in  In re Marriage Cases , overruling Proposition 22 and effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in California.       Main article:  Same-sex marriage in California         [ edit ]   Constitutional amendments   Immediately following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, a petition drive began to amend the  California Constitution  to forbid any recognitionincluding domestic partnershipsof  LBGT  relationships. [ 31 ]  The measure failed to qualify for the ballot.   For a month in early 2004,  San Francisco issued marriage licenses  to same-sex couples. The  Supreme Court of California  halted that process and later declared the marriages void. Regardless, four separate groups began petition drives to amend the California Constitution to prevent same-sex marriage and repeal domestic-partnership rights. [ 32 ]  The renewed efforts peaked in 2005, [ 33 ]  but have continued since. These groups have filed a total of 20 petitions, but none of the proposed amendments have qualified for the ballot. [ 34 ]   In 2008, two of these groups moved [ 35 ]  to qualify  ballot initiatives  to  amend  the  California Constitution  on the November 2008 ballot. One qualified as  Proposition 8 . The amendment eliminates the right of same-sex couples to marry, but does not repeal any rights granted to domestic partnerships and registration for domestic partnerships remains legal in California. [ 36 ]  In late 2008, Proposition 8 was passed by the voters, and its legality is now the subject of lawsuits in the California Supreme Court.

It affords the couple most of ""the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law..."" as married spouses.  [ 1 ]   Enacted in 1999, the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the  United States  created by a legislature without court intervention. Initially, domestic partnerships enjoyed very few privilegesprincipally just hospital-visitation rights. The  legislature  has since expanded the scope of California domestic partnerships to afford many of the rights and responsibilities common to marriage. As such, it is now difficult to distinguish California  domestic partnerships  from  civil unions  offered in a handful of other states.   Although the program enjoys broad support in California, [ 2 ]  it has been the source of some controversy. Groups opposed to the recognition of same-sex families have challenged the expansion of domestic partnerships in court. Conversely, advocates of  same-sex marriage  contend that anything less than full marriage rights extended to same-sex partners is analogous to the ""separate but equal"" racial laws of the Jim Crow era.

Consult the  California Secretary of State  for the most current information. [3]     [ edit ]   Scope   As of 2007, California affords domestic partnerships most of the same rights and responsibilities as marriages under state law (Cal. Fam. Code 297.5). Among these:     Making health care decisions for each other in certain circumstances   Hospital and jail visitation rights that were previously reserved for family members related by blood, adoption or marriage to the sick, injured or incarcerated person.   Access to family health insurance plans (Cal. Ins. Code 10121.7)   Spousal insurance policies (auto, life, homeowners etc..), this applies to all forms of insurance through the  California Insurance Equality Act  (Cal. Ins. Code 381.5)   Sick care and similar family leave   Stepparent adoption procedures   Presumption that both members of the partnership are the parents of a child born into the partnership   Suing for wrongful death of a domestic partner   Rights involving wills, intestate succession, conservatorships and trusts   The same property tax provisions otherwise available only to married couples (Cal. R&T Code 62p)   Access to some survivor pension benefits   Supervision of the  Superior Court of California  over dissolution and nullity proceedings   The obligation to file  state tax returns as a married couple (260k)  commencing with the 2007 tax year (Cal R&T Code 18521d)   The right for either partner to take the other partner's surname after registration   Community property rights and responsibilities previously only available to married spouses   The right to request partner support (alimony) upon dissolution of the partnership (divorce)   The same parental rights and responsibilities granted to and imposed upon spouses in a marriage       [ edit ]   Differences from Marriage   While domestic partners receive most of the benefits of marriage, several differences remain. These differences include, in part:     Couples seeking domestic partnership must already share a residence, married couples may be married without living together.   Couples seeking domestic partnership must be 18 or older, minors can be married before the age of 18 with the consent of their parents.   California permits married couples the option of  confidential marriage,  there is no equivalent institution for domestic partnerships. In confidential marriages, no witnesses are required and the marriage license is not a matter of public record.   Married partners of state employees are eligible for the  CalPERS  long-term care insurance plan, domestic partners are not.   There is, at least according to one appellate ruling, no equivalent of the  Putative Spouse Doctrine  for domestic partnerships.  [ 3 ]     In addition to these differences specific to state law, should the  Defense of Marriage Act  be found unconstitutional or repealed, married persons in California might enjoy all the federal benefits of marriage, including Constitutionally-required recognition of their relationships as marriages in the rest of the United States under the  Full Faith and Credit  Clause. [ citation needed ]   In addition to these differences specific to the United States, some countries that recognize same-sex marriages performed in California as valid in their own country, (e.g., Israel  [4] ), do not recognize same-sex domestic partnerships performed in California.   Many supporters of same-sex marriage also argue that the use of the word marriage itself constitutes a significant social difference, [ citation needed ]  and in the majority opinion of  In Re Marriage Cases , the California Supreme Court agreed,  [ 4 ]  suggesting an analogy with a hypothetical that branded interracial marriages ""transracial unions"".     [ edit ]   Eligibility   Currently, a couple that wishes to register must meet the following requirements:     Both persons have a common residence.   Neither person is married to someone else or is a member of another domestic partnership with someone else that has not been terminated, dissolved, or adjudged a nullity.   The two persons are not related by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in  California .   Both persons are at least 18 years of age.   Either of the following:    Both persons are members of the same sex.   The partners are of the opposite sex, one or both of whom is above the age of 62, and one or both of whom meet specified eligibility requirements under the Social Security Act.       Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership.            Example of California domestic partnership certificate.       Also, a legal union of a same-sex couple, other than  marriage , validly performed in another jurisdiction, that is substantially equivalent to a  California  domestic partnership, will be recognized as such in California.  Civil unions , such as those performed in  Vermont ,  Connecticut , and  New Jersey , would most likely qualify as domestic partnerships in  California . A valid same-sex marriage performed in a jurisdiction that recognizes such unions, such as  Massachusetts , would not be recognized in California as either a marriage or a domestic partnership. This is due to the fact that  California statute  prohibits recognition of another jurisdiction's validly performed same-sex marriage.   British law  recognizes California domestic partnerships as equivalent to  civil partnerships  in the  United Kingdom . The attorney general of  New Jersey  has ruled that California domestic partnerships are equivalent to civil unions in that state and likewise that civil unions in New Jersey can qualify as domestic partnerships in California.  Switzerland  recognizes California domestic partnerships as comparable to  Civil unions in Switzerland , including granting residency rights based on the partnership.     [ edit ]   Registration   Domestic partner registration is an uncomplicated process, more simple and less costly than entering into a marriage. Both parties must sign a declaration listing their names and address. Both signatures must be notarized. The declaration must then be transmitted to the Secretary of State along with a $10 filing fee (plus an additional $23 fee for same sex couples must be collected pursuant to CA Family Codes 298, 298.5 and 358, to help fund LGBT-specific domestic violence training and services). In this regard it is not like a marriage or civil union. Those unions require a ceremony, solemnized by either religious clergy or civil officials, to be deemed valid.     [ edit ]   Dissolution   In most cases, a domestic partnership must be dissolved through filing a court action identical to an action for dissolution of marriage. In limited circumstances, however, a filing with the Secretary of State may suffice. This procedure is available when the domestic partnership has not been in force for more than five years. The couple must also meet many other requirements that the dissolution be both simple and uncontested: no children (or current pregnancy) within the relationship, no real estate (including certain leases), and little joint property or debt. The parties must also review materials prepared by the Secretary of State, execute an agreement dividing assets and liability, and waive claims to domestic partner support. Where all the requirements are met, the partnership will terminate six months after the filing, unless either party revokes consent.     [ edit ]   Legislative history     [ edit ]   Attempts at the Municipal Level   In 1982, the  San Francisco Board of Supervisors  passed a measure to extend health insurance coverage to domestic partners of public employees, but did not provide for a registry available to the general public. Mayor  Dianne Feinstein  vetoed the measure. [ 5 ]  Eventually San Francisco enacted a similar measure, as did other communities, such as Berkeley, and some local agencies.   In 1984 the City of Berkeley was the first city to pass a domestic partner policy for city and school district employees. This followed a year of work by the Domestic Partner Task Force chaired by Leland Traiman. Working with the Task Force was Tom Brougham, a Berkeley city employee who coined the term ""domestic partner"" and created the concept. All other domestic partner policies are patterned after Berkeley's.   In 1985,  West Hollywood  became the first U.S. city to enact a domestic partnership registry open to the citizenry. Eventually other cities, including San Francisco, Berkeley, and Santa Cruz, followed suit. [ 6 ]   Despite successes in a handful of localities, supporters of legal recognition same-sex couples could not overcome the limited geographical scope and relatively modest range of programs administered at the county and city level. In the 1990s, they turned their attention the state legislature.     [ edit ]   Early attempts in the state legislature   Mirroring the experience of Californias local efforts, the state legislature did not initially succeed in providing health insurance coverage for domestic partners or creating a domestic partner registry for the general public.     Assembly Bill 627 of 1995:  In 1995, Assemblymember Richard Katz introduced a bill to create a domestic partner registry, open to both same- and opposite-sex couples. It sought to provide limited rights in medical decision making, conservatorships and a few related matters. It died in committee.  [ 7 ]   Murray-Katz Domestic Partnership Act of 1997:  At the beginning of the 19971998 legislative session Assemblymember Kevin Murray introduced Assembly Bill 54. It was similar to Assembly Bill 627 of 1995. After successfully negotiating two Assembly committees, Murray did not bring the bill to a vote on the Assembly floor. [ 8 ]   Assembly Bill 1059 of 1997:  In 1997, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced a bill that would require health insurance companies to offer for sale policies that would cover domestic partners of the insured, but did not require employers to provide the coverage. As later amended, it required employers who cover employees dependents to cover their domestic partners as well. The amended bill eventually gained approval of the legislature, but Governor  Pete Wilson  vetoed the measure. [ 9 ]   Domestic Partnership Act of 1999:  Kevin Murray, now a state senator, introduced Senate Bill 75 in December 1998. It was largely identical to his Assembly Bill 54 of 1997 and ultimately passed both houses of the state legislature. Governor  Gray Davis  vetoed the bill in favor of Assembly Bill 26, which was narrower in scope. [ 10 ]       [ edit ]   Establishment and incremental expansion     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 26 of 1999   Simultaneously with the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced Assembly Bill 26 of 1999. As originally drafted, it covered all adult couples, like its unsuccessful senate counterpart. Before bringing the bill to the Assembly floor, however, Migden narrowed its scope. Based on objections from Governor  Gray Davis , who did not want a competing alternative to marriage for opposite-sex couples, Migden eliminated coverage for opposite-sex couples where either participant less than 62 years of age. The bill passed, and Davis signed into law on September 22, 1999. It provided for a public registry, hospital visitation rights, and authorized health insurance coverage for domestic partners of public employees. [ 11 ]  While modest in scope, Assembly Bill 26 marked the first time a state legislature created a domestic partnership statute without the intervention of the courts. (Hawaiis legislature enacted a more expansive  reciprocal beneficiaries  scheme in 1997 in response to an unfavorable lower court ruling; Vermont enacted a sweeping  civil union  bill in 2000 at the direction of its state Supreme Court.)     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 25 of 2001   In the first successful expansion of the domestic partnership act, Assemblymembers  Carole Migden  and  Robert Hertzberg , joined by state Senator  Sheila Kuehl , introduced a bill that added 18 new rights to the domestic partnership scheme. It also relaxed the requirements for opposite-sex couples, requiring only one of the participants to be over 62 years of age. The expanded rights included standing to sue (for emotional distress or wrongful death), stepparent adoption, a variety of conservatorship rights, the right to make health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, certain rights regarding distribution of a deceased partners estate, limited taxpayer rights, sick leave to care for partners, and unemployment and disability insurance benefits. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on October 22, 2001. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Other bills in the 20012002 legislative session   During the 20012002 session, California enacted five more bills making minor changes:     Senate Bill 1049  ( Speier ) permitted  San Mateo County  to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 13 ]   Assembly Bill 2216  ( Keeley ) provided for  intestate succession . [ 14 ]   Assembly Bill 2777  ( Nation ) authorized  Los Angeles ,  Santa Barbara  and  Marin  counties to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 15 ]   Senate Bill 1575  (Sher) exempts domestic partners from certain provisions voiding wills that they helped draft. [ 16 ]   Senate Bill 1661  ( Kuehl ) extends temporary disability benefits to workers to take time off to care for a family member. [ 17 ]       [ edit ]   Wholesale expansion   The introduction of  The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003  (or  Assembly Bill 205 of 2003 ) marked a major shift in the legislatures approach to domestic partnerships. Earlier efforts afforded domestic partners only certain enumerated rights, which the legislature expanded in piecemeal fashion. This bill, introduced by Assemblymembers  Jackie Goldberg ,  Christine Kehoe ,  Paul Koretz ,  John Laird , and  Mark Leno , created the presumption that domestic partners were to have all of the rights and responsibilities afforded spouses under state law. The bill did carve out certain exceptions to this premise, principally involving the creation and dissolution of domestic partnerships and certain tax issues. It also, for the first time, recognized similar relationships, such as  civil unions , created in other states. Because the legislation dramatically changed the circumstances of existing domestic partnerships, the legislature directed the  Secretary of State  to inform all previously registered domestic partnerships of the changes and delayed the effect of the law for an additional year, until January 1, 2005. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on September 19, 2003.  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Subsequent changes and clarifications   Since enacting The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, the legislature has passed several bills aimed at clarifying how certain spousal provisions should be treated in the context of domestic partnerships and made some modest changes. The legislation signed by  Governor   Arnold Schwarzenegger  includes:     Assembly Bill 2208 of 2004  ( Kehoe ) clarifies that health and disability-insurance providers must treat domestic partners the same as married spouses. [ 19 ]   Senate Bill 565 of 2005  ( Migden ) allows transfer of property between domestic partners without reassessment for tax purposes. [ 20 ]   Senate Bill 973 of 2005  ( Kuehl ) specifies that domestic partners of state workers are entitled to retroactive pension benefits, even if the worker entered retirement before the enactment of Assembly Bill 205. [ 21 ]   Senate Bill 1827 of 2006  ( Migden ) requires domestic partners to file state income-tax returns under the same status as married couples (jointly or married filing separately), effective in the 2007 tax year. [ 22 ]   Assembly Bill 2051 of 2006  (Cohn) creates programs and funding grants to reduce domestic violence in the  LGBT  community and increases the fee for registering a domestic partnership by $23 to fund these services. The new fees are effective January 1, 2007. [ 23 ]   Assembly Bill 102 of 2007  ( Ma ) allows parties to a registered domestic partnership to legally change their name to include the last name of their partner.  [ 24 ]       [ edit ]   Popular opinion   California public opinion has long supported legal protections for gay and lesbian couples. In early 1997, two and half years before any statewide recognition occurred, polls showed two-thirds of Californians supported the limited provisions in unsuccessful bills debated in the legislature at the time. There was also strong support (59 percent) for broader provisions (pension, health, leave and survivor benefits) that werent enacted until more than four years later. [ 25 ]   Polls consistently show a marked contrast between support for domestic partnerships and  same-sex marriage . In 1997, roughly 38 percent of Californians supported same-sex marriage. More recent polls show an increase in support for same-sex marriage, but few polls suggest that there is any more support for same-sex marriage than a statistical tie with opponents. [ 26 ]  On November 4, 2008, Californians voted, 52.2% to 47.8%, to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Challenges to domestic partnerships   Despite broad support, Californias domestic partnership program has engendered opposition.     [ edit ]   Referendum   California law provides for  referendums , petition drives that would place any legislative enactment on the ballot for review. Following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, state senator  William Pete Knight  (author of the successful  Proposition 22  initiative) and Assemblymember  Ray Haynes  sought put the new legislation to a popular vote. The referendum failed to qualify for the ballot. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Litigation   Opponents of legal recognition for same-sex couples  filed two lawsuits in the  Superior Court of California . In the first case, state senator  William Pete Knight  sued Governor  Gray Davis  (later substituting Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger ) on the grounds that A.B. 205 impermissibly amended  Proposition 22 , which Knight authored. Randy Thomasson (an opponent of gay rights and head of the Campaign for California Families) filed a similar lawsuit, which challenged both A.B. 205 and the earlier domestic-partner expansion in A.B. 25. Both lawsuits, consolidated into a single action, failed at the trial and appellate courts. In the wake of those decisions, opponents of legal recognition for LGBT families launched at least two recall efforts against Judge Loren McMaster, who presided over the trial-court hearings. The recall efforts also failed. [ 29 ]   Along similar legal lines, defendants in a  wrongful-death action  brought by the survivor of a domestic partnership mounted a defense based partly on the ground that the legislative enactments giving a domestic partner standing to sue for wrongful death ran afoul of Proposition 22 (among other defenses). That defense failed on appeal. [ 30 ]       Main article:  California Proposition 22 (2000)       Proponents of same-sex marriage,  including the City and County of  San Francisco , have challenged the states opposite-sex marriage requirements on constitutional grounds. In pursuing these claims, the plaintiffs argue that even the broad protections of Californias domestic partnership scheme constitute a separate but unequal discriminatory framework. In May 2008, the  Supreme Court of California  ruled in their favor in  In re Marriage Cases , overruling Proposition 22 and effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in California.       Main article:  Same-sex marriage in California         [ edit ]   Constitutional amendments   Immediately following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, a petition drive began to amend the  California Constitution  to forbid any recognitionincluding domestic partnershipsof  LBGT  relationships. [ 31 ]  The measure failed to qualify for the ballot.   For a month in early 2004,  San Francisco issued marriage licenses  to same-sex couples. The  Supreme Court of California  halted that process and later declared the marriages void. Regardless, four separate groups began petition drives to amend the California Constitution to prevent same-sex marriage and repeal domestic-partnership rights. [ 32 ]  The renewed efforts peaked in 2005, [ 33 ]  but have continued since. These groups have filed a total of 20 petitions, but none of the proposed amendments have qualified for the ballot. [ 34 ]   In 2008, two of these groups moved [ 35 ]  to qualify  ballot initiatives  to  amend  the  California Constitution  on the November 2008 ballot. One qualified as  Proposition 8 . The amendment eliminates the right of same-sex couples to marry, but does not repeal any rights granted to domestic partnerships and registration for domestic partnerships remains legal in California. [ 36 ]  In late 2008, Proposition 8 was passed by the voters, and its legality is now the subject of lawsuits in the California Supreme Court.

It affords the couple most of ""the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law..."" as married spouses.  [ 1 ]   Enacted in 1999, the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the  United States  created by a legislature without court intervention. Initially, domestic partnerships enjoyed very few privilegesprincipally just hospital-visitation rights. The  legislature  has since expanded the scope of California domestic partnerships to afford many of the rights and responsibilities common to marriage. As such, it is now difficult to distinguish California  domestic partnerships  from  civil unions  offered in a handful of other states.   Although the program enjoys broad support in California, [ 2 ]  it has been the source of some controversy. Groups opposed to the recognition of same-sex families have challenged the expansion of domestic partnerships in court. Conversely, advocates of  same-sex marriage  contend that anything less than full marriage rights extended to same-sex partners is analogous to the ""separate but equal"" racial laws of the Jim Crow era.

Consult the  California Secretary of State  for the most current information. [3]     [ edit ]   Scope   As of 2007, California affords domestic partnerships most of the same rights and responsibilities as marriages under state law (Cal. Fam. Code 297.5). Among these:     Making health care decisions for each other in certain circumstances   Hospital and jail visitation rights that were previously reserved for family members related by blood, adoption or marriage to the sick, injured or incarcerated person.   Access to family health insurance plans (Cal. Ins. Code 10121.7)   Spousal insurance policies (auto, life, homeowners etc..), this applies to all forms of insurance through the  California Insurance Equality Act  (Cal. Ins. Code 381.5)   Sick care and similar family leave   Stepparent adoption procedures   Presumption that both members of the partnership are the parents of a child born into the partnership   Suing for wrongful death of a domestic partner   Rights involving wills, intestate succession, conservatorships and trusts   The same property tax provisions otherwise available only to married couples (Cal. R&T Code 62p)   Access to some survivor pension benefits   Supervision of the  Superior Court of California  over dissolution and nullity proceedings   The obligation to file  state tax returns as a married couple (260k)  commencing with the 2007 tax year (Cal R&T Code 18521d)   The right for either partner to take the other partner's surname after registration   Community property rights and responsibilities previously only available to married spouses   The right to request partner support (alimony) upon dissolution of the partnership (divorce)   The same parental rights and responsibilities granted to and imposed upon spouses in a marriage       [ edit ]   Differences from Marriage   While domestic partners receive most of the benefits of marriage, several differences remain. These differences include, in part:     Couples seeking domestic partnership must already share a residence, married couples may be married without living together.   Couples seeking domestic partnership must be 18 or older, minors can be married before the age of 18 with the consent of their parents.   California permits married couples the option of  confidential marriage,  there is no equivalent institution for domestic partnerships. In confidential marriages, no witnesses are required and the marriage license is not a matter of public record.   Married partners of state employees are eligible for the  CalPERS  long-term care insurance plan, domestic partners are not.   There is, at least according to one appellate ruling, no equivalent of the  Putative Spouse Doctrine  for domestic partnerships.  [ 3 ]     In addition to these differences specific to state law, should the  Defense of Marriage Act  be found unconstitutional or repealed, married persons in California might enjoy all the federal benefits of marriage, including Constitutionally-required recognition of their relationships as marriages in the rest of the United States under the  Full Faith and Credit  Clause. [ citation needed ]   In addition to these differences specific to the United States, some countries that recognize same-sex marriages performed in California as valid in their own country, (e.g., Israel  [4] ), do not recognize same-sex domestic partnerships performed in California.   Many supporters of same-sex marriage also argue that the use of the word marriage itself constitutes a significant social difference, [ citation needed ]  and in the majority opinion of  In Re Marriage Cases , the California Supreme Court agreed,  [ 4 ]  suggesting an analogy with a hypothetical that branded interracial marriages ""transracial unions"".     [ edit ]   Eligibility   Currently, a couple that wishes to register must meet the following requirements:     Both persons have a common residence.   Neither person is married to someone else or is a member of another domestic partnership with someone else that has not been terminated, dissolved, or adjudged a nullity.   The two persons are not related by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in  California .   Both persons are at least 18 years of age.   Either of the following:    Both persons are members of the same sex.   The partners are of the opposite sex, one or both of whom is above the age of 62, and one or both of whom meet specified eligibility requirements under the Social Security Act.       Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership.            Example of California domestic partnership certificate.       Also, a legal union of a same-sex couple, other than  marriage , validly performed in another jurisdiction, that is substantially equivalent to a  California  domestic partnership, will be recognized as such in California.  Civil unions , such as those performed in  Vermont ,  Connecticut , and  New Jersey , would most likely qualify as domestic partnerships in  California . A valid same-sex marriage performed in a jurisdiction that recognizes such unions, such as  Massachusetts , would not be recognized in California as either a marriage or a domestic partnership. This is due to the fact that  California statute  prohibits recognition of another jurisdiction's validly performed same-sex marriage.   British law  recognizes California domestic partnerships as equivalent to  civil partnerships  in the  United Kingdom . The attorney general of  New Jersey  has ruled that California domestic partnerships are equivalent to civil unions in that state and likewise that civil unions in New Jersey can qualify as domestic partnerships in California.  Switzerland  recognizes California domestic partnerships as comparable to  Civil unions in Switzerland , including granting residency rights based on the partnership.     [ edit ]   Registration   Domestic partner registration is an uncomplicated process, more simple and less costly than entering into a marriage. Both parties must sign a declaration listing their names and address. Both signatures must be notarized. The declaration must then be transmitted to the Secretary of State along with a $10 filing fee (plus an additional $23 fee for same sex couples must be collected pursuant to CA Family Codes 298, 298.5 and 358, to help fund LGBT-specific domestic violence training and services). In this regard it is not like a marriage or civil union. Those unions require a ceremony, solemnized by either religious clergy or civil officials, to be deemed valid.     [ edit ]   Dissolution   In most cases, a domestic partnership must be dissolved through filing a court action identical to an action for dissolution of marriage. In limited circumstances, however, a filing with the Secretary of State may suffice. This procedure is available when the domestic partnership has not been in force for more than five years. The couple must also meet many other requirements that the dissolution be both simple and uncontested: no children (or current pregnancy) within the relationship, no real estate (including certain leases), and little joint property or debt. The parties must also review materials prepared by the Secretary of State, execute an agreement dividing assets and liability, and waive claims to domestic partner support. Where all the requirements are met, the partnership will terminate six months after the filing, unless either party revokes consent.     [ edit ]   Legislative history     [ edit ]   Attempts at the Municipal Level   In 1982, the  San Francisco Board of Supervisors  passed a measure to extend health insurance coverage to domestic partners of public employees, but did not provide for a registry available to the general public. Mayor  Dianne Feinstein  vetoed the measure. [ 5 ]  Eventually San Francisco enacted a similar measure, as did other communities, such as Berkeley, and some local agencies.   In 1984 the City of Berkeley was the first city to pass a domestic partner policy for city and school district employees. This followed a year of work by the Domestic Partner Task Force chaired by Leland Traiman. Working with the Task Force was Tom Brougham, a Berkeley city employee who coined the term ""domestic partner"" and created the concept. All other domestic partner policies are patterned after Berkeley's.   In 1985,  West Hollywood  became the first U.S. city to enact a domestic partnership registry open to the citizenry. Eventually other cities, including San Francisco, Berkeley, and Santa Cruz, followed suit. [ 6 ]   Despite successes in a handful of localities, supporters of legal recognition same-sex couples could not overcome the limited geographical scope and relatively modest range of programs administered at the county and city level. In the 1990s, they turned their attention the state legislature.     [ edit ]   Early attempts in the state legislature   Mirroring the experience of Californias local efforts, the state legislature did not initially succeed in providing health insurance coverage for domestic partners or creating a domestic partner registry for the general public.     Assembly Bill 627 of 1995:  In 1995, Assemblymember Richard Katz introduced a bill to create a domestic partner registry, open to both same- and opposite-sex couples. It sought to provide limited rights in medical decision making, conservatorships and a few related matters. It died in committee.  [ 7 ]   Murray-Katz Domestic Partnership Act of 1997:  At the beginning of the 19971998 legislative session Assemblymember Kevin Murray introduced Assembly Bill 54. It was similar to Assembly Bill 627 of 1995. After successfully negotiating two Assembly committees, Murray did not bring the bill to a vote on the Assembly floor. [ 8 ]   Assembly Bill 1059 of 1997:  In 1997, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced a bill that would require health insurance companies to offer for sale policies that would cover domestic partners of the insured, but did not require employers to provide the coverage. As later amended, it required employers who cover employees dependents to cover their domestic partners as well. The amended bill eventually gained approval of the legislature, but Governor  Pete Wilson  vetoed the measure. [ 9 ]   Domestic Partnership Act of 1999:  Kevin Murray, now a state senator, introduced Senate Bill 75 in December 1998. It was largely identical to his Assembly Bill 54 of 1997 and ultimately passed both houses of the state legislature. Governor  Gray Davis  vetoed the bill in favor of Assembly Bill 26, which was narrower in scope. [ 10 ]       [ edit ]   Establishment and incremental expansion     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 26 of 1999   Simultaneously with the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced Assembly Bill 26 of 1999. As originally drafted, it covered all adult couples, like its unsuccessful senate counterpart. Before bringing the bill to the Assembly floor, however, Migden narrowed its scope. Based on objections from Governor  Gray Davis , who did not want a competing alternative to marriage for opposite-sex couples, Migden eliminated coverage for opposite-sex couples where either participant less than 62 years of age. The bill passed, and Davis signed into law on September 22, 1999. It provided for a public registry, hospital visitation rights, and authorized health insurance coverage for domestic partners of public employees. [ 11 ]  While modest in scope, Assembly Bill 26 marked the first time a state legislature created a domestic partnership statute without the intervention of the courts. (Hawaiis legislature enacted a more expansive  reciprocal beneficiaries  scheme in 1997 in response to an unfavorable lower court ruling; Vermont enacted a sweeping  civil union  bill in 2000 at the direction of its state Supreme Court.)     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 25 of 2001   In the first successful expansion of the domestic partnership act, Assemblymembers  Carole Migden  and  Robert Hertzberg , joined by state Senator  Sheila Kuehl , introduced a bill that added 18 new rights to the domestic partnership scheme. It also relaxed the requirements for opposite-sex couples, requiring only one of the participants to be over 62 years of age. The expanded rights included standing to sue (for emotional distress or wrongful death), stepparent adoption, a variety of conservatorship rights, the right to make health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, certain rights regarding distribution of a deceased partners estate, limited taxpayer rights, sick leave to care for partners, and unemployment and disability insurance benefits. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on October 22, 2001. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Other bills in the 20012002 legislative session   During the 20012002 session, California enacted five more bills making minor changes:     Senate Bill 1049  ( Speier ) permitted  San Mateo County  to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 13 ]   Assembly Bill 2216  ( Keeley ) provided for  intestate succession . [ 14 ]   Assembly Bill 2777  ( Nation ) authorized  Los Angeles ,  Santa Barbara  and  Marin  counties to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 15 ]   Senate Bill 1575  (Sher) exempts domestic partners from certain provisions voiding wills that they helped draft. [ 16 ]   Senate Bill 1661  ( Kuehl ) extends temporary disability benefits to workers to take time off to care for a family member. [ 17 ]       [ edit ]   Wholesale expansion   The introduction of  The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003  (or  Assembly Bill 205 of 2003 ) marked a major shift in the legislatures approach to domestic partnerships. Earlier efforts afforded domestic partners only certain enumerated rights, which the legislature expanded in piecemeal fashion. This bill, introduced by Assemblymembers  Jackie Goldberg ,  Christine Kehoe ,  Paul Koretz ,  John Laird , and  Mark Leno , created the presumption that domestic partners were to have all of the rights and responsibilities afforded spouses under state law. The bill did carve out certain exceptions to this premise, principally involving the creation and dissolution of domestic partnerships and certain tax issues. It also, for the first time, recognized similar relationships, such as  civil unions , created in other states. Because the legislation dramatically changed the circumstances of existing domestic partnerships, the legislature directed the  Secretary of State  to inform all previously registered domestic partnerships of the changes and delayed the effect of the law for an additional year, until January 1, 2005. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on September 19, 2003.  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Subsequent changes and clarifications   Since enacting The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, the legislature has passed several bills aimed at clarifying how certain spousal provisions should be treated in the context of domestic partnerships and made some modest changes. The legislation signed by  Governor   Arnold Schwarzenegger  includes:     Assembly Bill 2208 of 2004  ( Kehoe ) clarifies that health and disability-insurance providers must treat domestic partners the same as married spouses. [ 19 ]   Senate Bill 565 of 2005  ( Migden ) allows transfer of property between domestic partners without reassessment for tax purposes. [ 20 ]   Senate Bill 973 of 2005  ( Kuehl ) specifies that domestic partners of state workers are entitled to retroactive pension benefits, even if the worker entered retirement before the enactment of Assembly Bill 205. [ 21 ]   Senate Bill 1827 of 2006  ( Migden ) requires domestic partners to file state income-tax returns under the same status as married couples (jointly or married filing separately), effective in the 2007 tax year. [ 22 ]   Assembly Bill 2051 of 2006  (Cohn) creates programs and funding grants to reduce domestic violence in the  LGBT  community and increases the fee for registering a domestic partnership by $23 to fund these services. The new fees are effective January 1, 2007. [ 23 ]   Assembly Bill 102 of 2007  ( Ma ) allows parties to a registered domestic partnership to legally change their name to include the last name of their partner.  [ 24 ]       [ edit ]   Popular opinion   California public opinion has long supported legal protections for gay and lesbian couples. In early 1997, two and half years before any statewide recognition occurred, polls showed two-thirds of Californians supported the limited provisions in unsuccessful bills debated in the legislature at the time. There was also strong support (59 percent) for broader provisions (pension, health, leave and survivor benefits) that werent enacted until more than four years later. [ 25 ]   Polls consistently show a marked contrast between support for domestic partnerships and  same-sex marriage . In 1997, roughly 38 percent of Californians supported same-sex marriage. More recent polls show an increase in support for same-sex marriage, but few polls suggest that there is any more support for same-sex marriage than a statistical tie with opponents. [ 26 ]  On November 4, 2008, Californians voted, 52.2% to 47.8%, to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Challenges to domestic partnerships   Despite broad support, Californias domestic partnership program has engendered opposition.     [ edit ]   Referendum   California law provides for  referendums , petition drives that would place any legislative enactment on the ballot for review. Following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, state senator  William Pete Knight  (author of the successful  Proposition 22  initiative) and Assemblymember  Ray Haynes  sought put the new legislation to a popular vote. The referendum failed to qualify for the ballot. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Litigation   Opponents of legal recognition for same-sex couples  filed two lawsuits in the  Superior Court of California . In the first case, state senator  William Pete Knight  sued Governor  Gray Davis  (later substituting Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger ) on the grounds that A.B. 205 impermissibly amended  Proposition 22 , which Knight authored. Randy Thomasson (an opponent of gay rights and head of the Campaign for California Families) filed a similar lawsuit, which challenged both A.B. 205 and the earlier domestic-partner expansion in A.B. 25. Both lawsuits, consolidated into a single action, failed at the trial and appellate courts. In the wake of those decisions, opponents of legal recognition for LGBT families launched at least two recall efforts against Judge Loren McMaster, who presided over the trial-court hearings. The recall efforts also failed. [ 29 ]   Along similar legal lines, defendants in a  wrongful-death action  brought by the survivor of a domestic partnership mounted a defense based partly on the ground that the legislative enactments giving a domestic partner standing to sue for wrongful death ran afoul of Proposition 22 (among other defenses). That defense failed on appeal. [ 30 ]       Main article:  California Proposition 22 (2000)       Proponents of same-sex marriage,  including the City and County of  San Francisco , have challenged the states opposite-sex marriage requirements on constitutional grounds. In pursuing these claims, the plaintiffs argue that even the broad protections of Californias domestic partnership scheme constitute a separate but unequal discriminatory framework. In May 2008, the  Supreme Court of California  ruled in their favor in  In re Marriage Cases , overruling Proposition 22 and effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in California.       Main article:  Same-sex marriage in California         [ edit ]   Constitutional amendments   Immediately following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, a petition drive began to amend the  California Constitution  to forbid any recognitionincluding domestic partnershipsof  LBGT  relationships. [ 31 ]  The measure failed to qualify for the ballot.   For a month in early 2004,  San Francisco issued marriage licenses  to same-sex couples. The  Supreme Court of California  halted that process and later declared the marriages void. Regardless, four separate groups began petition drives to amend the California Constitution to prevent same-sex marriage and repeal domestic-partnership rights. [ 32 ]  The renewed efforts peaked in 2005, [ 33 ]  but have continued since. These groups have filed a total of 20 petitions, but none of the proposed amendments have qualified for the ballot. [ 34 ]   In 2008, two of these groups moved [ 35 ]  to qualify  ballot initiatives  to  amend  the  California Constitution  on the November 2008 ballot. One qualified as  Proposition 8 . The amendment eliminates the right of same-sex couples to marry, but does not repeal any rights granted to domestic partnerships and registration for domestic partnerships remains legal in California. [ 36 ]  In late 2008, Proposition 8 was passed by the voters, and its legality is now the subject of lawsuits in the California Supreme Court.

It affords the couple most of ""the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law..."" as married spouses.  [ 1 ]   Enacted in 1999, the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the  United States  created by a legislature without court intervention. Initially, domestic partnerships enjoyed very few privilegesprincipally just hospital-visitation rights. The  legislature  has since expanded the scope of California domestic partnerships to afford many of the rights and responsibilities common to marriage. As such, it is now difficult to distinguish California  domestic partnerships  from  civil unions  offered in a handful of other states.   Although the program enjoys broad support in California, [ 2 ]  it has been the source of some controversy. Groups opposed to the recognition of same-sex families have challenged the expansion of domestic partnerships in court. Conversely, advocates of  same-sex marriage  contend that anything less than full marriage rights extended to same-sex partners is analogous to the ""separate but equal"" racial laws of the Jim Crow era.

Consult the  California Secretary of State  for the most current information. [3]     [ edit ]   Scope   As of 2007, California affords domestic partnerships most of the same rights and responsibilities as marriages under state law (Cal. Fam. Code 297.5). Among these:     Making health care decisions for each other in certain circumstances   Hospital and jail visitation rights that were previously reserved for family members related by blood, adoption or marriage to the sick, injured or incarcerated person.   Access to family health insurance plans (Cal. Ins. Code 10121.7)   Spousal insurance policies (auto, life, homeowners etc..), this applies to all forms of insurance through the  California Insurance Equality Act  (Cal. Ins. Code 381.5)   Sick care and similar family leave   Stepparent adoption procedures   Presumption that both members of the partnership are the parents of a child born into the partnership   Suing for wrongful death of a domestic partner   Rights involving wills, intestate succession, conservatorships and trusts   The same property tax provisions otherwise available only to married couples (Cal. R&T Code 62p)   Access to some survivor pension benefits   Supervision of the  Superior Court of California  over dissolution and nullity proceedings   The obligation to file  state tax returns as a married couple (260k)  commencing with the 2007 tax year (Cal R&T Code 18521d)   The right for either partner to take the other partner's surname after registration   Community property rights and responsibilities previously only available to married spouses   The right to request partner support (alimony) upon dissolution of the partnership (divorce)   The same parental rights and responsibilities granted to and imposed upon spouses in a marriage       [ edit ]   Differences from Marriage   While domestic partners receive most of the benefits of marriage, several differences remain. These differences include, in part:     Couples seeking domestic partnership must already share a residence, married couples may be married without living together.   Couples seeking domestic partnership must be 18 or older, minors can be married before the age of 18 with the consent of their parents.   California permits married couples the option of  confidential marriage,  there is no equivalent institution for domestic partnerships. In confidential marriages, no witnesses are required and the marriage license is not a matter of public record.   Married partners of state employees are eligible for the  CalPERS  long-term care insurance plan, domestic partners are not.   There is, at least according to one appellate ruling, no equivalent of the  Putative Spouse Doctrine  for domestic partnerships.  [ 3 ]     In addition to these differences specific to state law, should the  Defense of Marriage Act  be found unconstitutional or repealed, married persons in California might enjoy all the federal benefits of marriage, including Constitutionally-required recognition of their relationships as marriages in the rest of the United States under the  Full Faith and Credit  Clause. [ citation needed ]   In addition to these differences specific to the United States, some countries that recognize same-sex marriages performed in California as valid in their own country, (e.g., Israel  [4] ), do not recognize same-sex domestic partnerships performed in California.   Many supporters of same-sex marriage also argue that the use of the word marriage itself constitutes a significant social difference, [ citation needed ]  and in the majority opinion of  In Re Marriage Cases , the California Supreme Court agreed,  [ 4 ]  suggesting an analogy with a hypothetical that branded interracial marriages ""transracial unions"".     [ edit ]   Eligibility   Currently, a couple that wishes to register must meet the following requirements:     Both persons have a common residence.   Neither person is married to someone else or is a member of another domestic partnership with someone else that has not been terminated, dissolved, or adjudged a nullity.   The two persons are not related by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in  California .   Both persons are at least 18 years of age.   Either of the following:    Both persons are members of the same sex.   The partners are of the opposite sex, one or both of whom is above the age of 62, and one or both of whom meet specified eligibility requirements under the Social Security Act.       Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership.            Example of California domestic partnership certificate.       Also, a legal union of a same-sex couple, other than  marriage , validly performed in another jurisdiction, that is substantially equivalent to a  California  domestic partnership, will be recognized as such in California.  Civil unions , such as those performed in  Vermont ,  Connecticut , and  New Jersey , would most likely qualify as domestic partnerships in  California . A valid same-sex marriage performed in a jurisdiction that recognizes such unions, such as  Massachusetts , would not be recognized in California as either a marriage or a domestic partnership. This is due to the fact that  California statute  prohibits recognition of another jurisdiction's validly performed same-sex marriage.   British law  recognizes California domestic partnerships as equivalent to  civil partnerships  in the  United Kingdom . The attorney general of  New Jersey  has ruled that California domestic partnerships are equivalent to civil unions in that state and likewise that civil unions in New Jersey can qualify as domestic partnerships in California.  Switzerland  recognizes California domestic partnerships as comparable to  Civil unions in Switzerland , including granting residency rights based on the partnership.     [ edit ]   Registration   Domestic partner registration is an uncomplicated process, more simple and less costly than entering into a marriage. Both parties must sign a declaration listing their names and address. Both signatures must be notarized. The declaration must then be transmitted to the Secretary of State along with a $10 filing fee (plus an additional $23 fee for same sex couples must be collected pursuant to CA Family Codes 298, 298.5 and 358, to help fund LGBT-specific domestic violence training and services). In this regard it is not like a marriage or civil union. Those unions require a ceremony, solemnized by either religious clergy or civil officials, to be deemed valid.     [ edit ]   Dissolution   In most cases, a domestic partnership must be dissolved through filing a court action identical to an action for dissolution of marriage. In limited circumstances, however, a filing with the Secretary of State may suffice. This procedure is available when the domestic partnership has not been in force for more than five years. The couple must also meet many other requirements that the dissolution be both simple and uncontested: no children (or current pregnancy) within the relationship, no real estate (including certain leases), and little joint property or debt. The parties must also review materials prepared by the Secretary of State, execute an agreement dividing assets and liability, and waive claims to domestic partner support. Where all the requirements are met, the partnership will terminate six months after the filing, unless either party revokes consent.     [ edit ]   Legislative history     [ edit ]   Attempts at the Municipal Level   In 1982, the  San Francisco Board of Supervisors  passed a measure to extend health insurance coverage to domestic partners of public employees, but did not provide for a registry available to the general public. Mayor  Dianne Feinstein  vetoed the measure. [ 5 ]  Eventually San Francisco enacted a similar measure, as did other communities, such as Berkeley, and some local agencies.   In 1984 the City of Berkeley was the first city to pass a domestic partner policy for city and school district employees. This followed a year of work by the Domestic Partner Task Force chaired by Leland Traiman. Working with the Task Force was Tom Brougham, a Berkeley city employee who coined the term ""domestic partner"" and created the concept. All other domestic partner policies are patterned after Berkeley's.   In 1985,  West Hollywood  became the first U.S. city to enact a domestic partnership registry open to the citizenry. Eventually other cities, including San Francisco, Berkeley, and Santa Cruz, followed suit. [ 6 ]   Despite successes in a handful of localities, supporters of legal recognition same-sex couples could not overcome the limited geographical scope and relatively modest range of programs administered at the county and city level. In the 1990s, they turned their attention the state legislature.     [ edit ]   Early attempts in the state legislature   Mirroring the experience of Californias local efforts, the state legislature did not initially succeed in providing health insurance coverage for domestic partners or creating a domestic partner registry for the general public.     Assembly Bill 627 of 1995:  In 1995, Assemblymember Richard Katz introduced a bill to create a domestic partner registry, open to both same- and opposite-sex couples. It sought to provide limited rights in medical decision making, conservatorships and a few related matters. It died in committee.  [ 7 ]   Murray-Katz Domestic Partnership Act of 1997:  At the beginning of the 19971998 legislative session Assemblymember Kevin Murray introduced Assembly Bill 54. It was similar to Assembly Bill 627 of 1995. After successfully negotiating two Assembly committees, Murray did not bring the bill to a vote on the Assembly floor. [ 8 ]   Assembly Bill 1059 of 1997:  In 1997, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced a bill that would require health insurance companies to offer for sale policies that would cover domestic partners of the insured, but did not require employers to provide the coverage. As later amended, it required employers who cover employees dependents to cover their domestic partners as well. The amended bill eventually gained approval of the legislature, but Governor  Pete Wilson  vetoed the measure. [ 9 ]   Domestic Partnership Act of 1999:  Kevin Murray, now a state senator, introduced Senate Bill 75 in December 1998. It was largely identical to his Assembly Bill 54 of 1997 and ultimately passed both houses of the state legislature. Governor  Gray Davis  vetoed the bill in favor of Assembly Bill 26, which was narrower in scope. [ 10 ]       [ edit ]   Establishment and incremental expansion     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 26 of 1999   Simultaneously with the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced Assembly Bill 26 of 1999. As originally drafted, it covered all adult couples, like its unsuccessful senate counterpart. Before bringing the bill to the Assembly floor, however, Migden narrowed its scope. Based on objections from Governor  Gray Davis , who did not want a competing alternative to marriage for opposite-sex couples, Migden eliminated coverage for opposite-sex couples where either participant less than 62 years of age. The bill passed, and Davis signed into law on September 22, 1999. It provided for a public registry, hospital visitation rights, and authorized health insurance coverage for domestic partners of public employees. [ 11 ]  While modest in scope, Assembly Bill 26 marked the first time a state legislature created a domestic partnership statute without the intervention of the courts. (Hawaiis legislature enacted a more expansive  reciprocal beneficiaries  scheme in 1997 in response to an unfavorable lower court ruling; Vermont enacted a sweeping  civil union  bill in 2000 at the direction of its state Supreme Court.)     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 25 of 2001   In the first successful expansion of the domestic partnership act, Assemblymembers  Carole Migden  and  Robert Hertzberg , joined by state Senator  Sheila Kuehl , introduced a bill that added 18 new rights to the domestic partnership scheme. It also relaxed the requirements for opposite-sex couples, requiring only one of the participants to be over 62 years of age. The expanded rights included standing to sue (for emotional distress or wrongful death), stepparent adoption, a variety of conservatorship rights, the right to make health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, certain rights regarding distribution of a deceased partners estate, limited taxpayer rights, sick leave to care for partners, and unemployment and disability insurance benefits. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on October 22, 2001. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Other bills in the 20012002 legislative session   During the 20012002 session, California enacted five more bills making minor changes:     Senate Bill 1049  ( Speier ) permitted  San Mateo County  to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 13 ]   Assembly Bill 2216  ( Keeley ) provided for  intestate succession . [ 14 ]   Assembly Bill 2777  ( Nation ) authorized  Los Angeles ,  Santa Barbara  and  Marin  counties to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 15 ]   Senate Bill 1575  (Sher) exempts domestic partners from certain provisions voiding wills that they helped draft. [ 16 ]   Senate Bill 1661  ( Kuehl ) extends temporary disability benefits to workers to take time off to care for a family member. [ 17 ]       [ edit ]   Wholesale expansion   The introduction of  The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003  (or  Assembly Bill 205 of 2003 ) marked a major shift in the legislatures approach to domestic partnerships. Earlier efforts afforded domestic partners only certain enumerated rights, which the legislature expanded in piecemeal fashion. This bill, introduced by Assemblymembers  Jackie Goldberg ,  Christine Kehoe ,  Paul Koretz ,  John Laird , and  Mark Leno , created the presumption that domestic partners were to have all of the rights and responsibilities afforded spouses under state law. The bill did carve out certain exceptions to this premise, principally involving the creation and dissolution of domestic partnerships and certain tax issues. It also, for the first time, recognized similar relationships, such as  civil unions , created in other states. Because the legislation dramatically changed the circumstances of existing domestic partnerships, the legislature directed the  Secretary of State  to inform all previously registered domestic partnerships of the changes and delayed the effect of the law for an additional year, until January 1, 2005. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on September 19, 2003.  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Subsequent changes and clarifications   Since enacting The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, the legislature has passed several bills aimed at clarifying how certain spousal provisions should be treated in the context of domestic partnerships and made some modest changes. The legislation signed by  Governor   Arnold Schwarzenegger  includes:     Assembly Bill 2208 of 2004  ( Kehoe ) clarifies that health and disability-insurance providers must treat domestic partners the same as married spouses. [ 19 ]   Senate Bill 565 of 2005  ( Migden ) allows transfer of property between domestic partners without reassessment for tax purposes. [ 20 ]   Senate Bill 973 of 2005  ( Kuehl ) specifies that domestic partners of state workers are entitled to retroactive pension benefits, even if the worker entered retirement before the enactment of Assembly Bill 205. [ 21 ]   Senate Bill 1827 of 2006  ( Migden ) requires domestic partners to file state income-tax returns under the same status as married couples (jointly or married filing separately), effective in the 2007 tax year. [ 22 ]   Assembly Bill 2051 of 2006  (Cohn) creates programs and funding grants to reduce domestic violence in the  LGBT  community and increases the fee for registering a domestic partnership by $23 to fund these services. The new fees are effective January 1, 2007. [ 23 ]   Assembly Bill 102 of 2007  ( Ma ) allows parties to a registered domestic partnership to legally change their name to include the last name of their partner.  [ 24 ]       [ edit ]   Popular opinion   California public opinion has long supported legal protections for gay and lesbian couples. In early 1997, two and half years before any statewide recognition occurred, polls showed two-thirds of Californians supported the limited provisions in unsuccessful bills debated in the legislature at the time. There was also strong support (59 percent) for broader provisions (pension, health, leave and survivor benefits) that werent enacted until more than four years later. [ 25 ]   Polls consistently show a marked contrast between support for domestic partnerships and  same-sex marriage . In 1997, roughly 38 percent of Californians supported same-sex marriage. More recent polls show an increase in support for same-sex marriage, but few polls suggest that there is any more support for same-sex marriage than a statistical tie with opponents. [ 26 ]  On November 4, 2008, Californians voted, 52.2% to 47.8%, to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Challenges to domestic partnerships   Despite broad support, Californias domestic partnership program has engendered opposition.     [ edit ]   Referendum   California law provides for  referendums , petition drives that would place any legislative enactment on the ballot for review. Following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, state senator  William Pete Knight  (author of the successful  Proposition 22  initiative) and Assemblymember  Ray Haynes  sought put the new legislation to a popular vote. The referendum failed to qualify for the ballot. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Litigation   Opponents of legal recognition for same-sex couples  filed two lawsuits in the  Superior Court of California . In the first case, state senator  William Pete Knight  sued Governor  Gray Davis  (later substituting Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger ) on the grounds that A.B. 205 impermissibly amended  Proposition 22 , which Knight authored. Randy Thomasson (an opponent of gay rights and head of the Campaign for California Families) filed a similar lawsuit, which challenged both A.B. 205 and the earlier domestic-partner expansion in A.B. 25. Both lawsuits, consolidated into a single action, failed at the trial and appellate courts. In the wake of those decisions, opponents of legal recognition for LGBT families launched at least two recall efforts against Judge Loren McMaster, who presided over the trial-court hearings. The recall efforts also failed. [ 29 ]   Along similar legal lines, defendants in a  wrongful-death action  brought by the survivor of a domestic partnership mounted a defense based partly on the ground that the legislative enactments giving a domestic partner standing to sue for wrongful death ran afoul of Proposition 22 (among other defenses). That defense failed on appeal. [ 30 ]       Main article:  California Proposition 22 (2000)       Proponents of same-sex marriage,  including the City and County of  San Francisco , have challenged the states opposite-sex marriage requirements on constitutional grounds. In pursuing these claims, the plaintiffs argue that even the broad protections of Californias domestic partnership scheme constitute a separate but unequal discriminatory framework. In May 2008, the  Supreme Court of California  ruled in their favor in  In re Marriage Cases , overruling Proposition 22 and effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in California.       Main article:  Same-sex marriage in California         [ edit ]   Constitutional amendments   Immediately following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, a petition drive began to amend the  California Constitution  to forbid any recognitionincluding domestic partnershipsof  LBGT  relationships. [ 31 ]  The measure failed to qualify for the ballot.   For a month in early 2004,  San Francisco issued marriage licenses  to same-sex couples. The  Supreme Court of California  halted that process and later declared the marriages void. Regardless, four separate groups began petition drives to amend the California Constitution to prevent same-sex marriage and repeal domestic-partnership rights. [ 32 ]  The renewed efforts peaked in 2005, [ 33 ]  but have continued since. These groups have filed a total of 20 petitions, but none of the proposed amendments have qualified for the ballot. [ 34 ]   In 2008, two of these groups moved [ 35 ]  to qualify  ballot initiatives  to  amend  the  California Constitution  on the November 2008 ballot. One qualified as  Proposition 8 . The amendment eliminates the right of same-sex couples to marry, but does not repeal any rights granted to domestic partnerships and registration for domestic partnerships remains legal in California. [ 36 ]  In late 2008, Proposition 8 was passed by the voters, and its legality is now the subject of lawsuits in the California Supreme Court.

Because such disease and its accompanying  symptoms  often  did not develop until approximately 10-40 years after exposure, it wasn’t until  the early 20th century that many cases came to light. By 1928, the  name  Asbestosis  became the tag for lung diseases thought to be caused by   asbestos  inhalation.   It was shortly after this that companies began to cover up  the suspected effects of asbestos and the dangers of working with this  material.  Companies that produced  asbestos or asbestos products began circulating “internal memos” as to  suspicious worker fatalities and had private discussions about the medical  reports that documented their employees’ asbestos-related deaths.  Such information was concealed from other  employees who may have been at risk.   By the mid-1930s, large corporations were settling lawsuits  brought about by victims of Asbestosis by demanding that their lawyers never  again participate in the bringing of new actions against them on behalf of  other asbestos-related disease sufferers.   Furthermore, it’s been documented that corporate officials in the 1930s and  1940s altered warnings that were issued by insurance companies to employees,  downplaying the dangers of asbestos inhalation.     When major asbestos companies did agree to conduct health  studies in regards to the effects of working with asbestos, they took it upon  themselves to once again alter the results, erasing any information that  related asbestos to serious pulmonary disease before these reports were  released to their employees and/or the general public.   By this time, physicians began noticing that their asbestos-exposed  patients had not only contracted  asbestosis    - characterized by such symptoms as difficulty breathing, an enlarged  heart, and persistent dry cough – but many appeared to also be suffering from  lung  cancer .  The “c” word further alarmed  asbestos companies and an extensive cover-up became all the more important in  preserving their profits.   Factory supervisors and others that attempted to expose  risks or to implement safety precautions were usually stopped in their  tracks.  Finally, in 1964, those who had  long touted the dangers of working with asbestos were backed by a report in the  Journal of the American Medical Association, penned by Dr. Irving Selikoff,  stating that, among those who work with asbestos-containing materials, there  was an abnormal incidence of asbestosis, lung cancer, and  Mesothelioma . Still,  asbestos company owners attempted to negate or alter the facts found in this  article and other such reports.      At last, in 1971, the first  OSHA  asbestos-exposure standard was  issued.  By 1973, the  EPA  banned spray-on  asbestos insulation, noting that it was an air pollution hazard. Towards the end of the  1970s, documentation began to surface which proved that many large corporations  had suppressed information about the dangers of exposure to asbestos, hoping to  avoid lawsuits by affected employees and/or their families.   In 1979, the U.S. EPA announced their intention to issue a  ruling that banned all uses of asbestos.   Many other countries followed suit within the next decade.  Still, there are countries, many in South   America, that have not yet banned the use of asbestos in  construction and other products.   Furthermore, the decades-long cover-up will long affect those who worked  with asbestos prior to the 1980s.

There are only six  asbestos-containing products , also known as asbestos-containing materials (ACM), that are considered illegal to use.     The first thing to know is what qualifies a material as ""asbestos-containing.""     If a material contains  one percent or more of asbestos fibers, either by weight or by total surface area (like roofing felt or flooring), then that material is illegal to use under federal law.    The difference between asbestos-containing materials is whether or not they are ""friable."" Friable ACM  can be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by the pressure of a human hand. This becomes a concern because asbestos fibers are dangerous when broken loose and begin floating in the air. The fibers become loose when the surrounding material is crumbled away. A non-friable ACM can also contain more than one percent asbestos, but it cannot be pulverized under hand pressure and therefore causes little to no harm. It is harder to release the fibers and create a danger to health. However, there remains room for non-friable ACM to be dangerous and therefore falls under government regulations.     There are two categories of non-friable ACM. Materials in Category I are non-friable because their surrounding materials are flexible and durable, which include packings, gaskets, resilient floor covering, and asphalt roofing products. Everything else non-friable is Category II.     Both friable and non-friable materials fall under the definition of ""regulated asbestos-containing material"" (RACM). The regulations cover:       All friable asbestos-containing material     Category I non-friable asbestos materials that have become friable for whatever reason - age, exposure to sunlight, or other forces that have broken down the material   Category I non-friable asbestos materials that will be or have been subjected to sanding, grinding, cutting, or abrading  become  as dangerous as friable ACMs    Category II non-friable asbestos materials that have a high probability of becoming, or that have already become, crumbled, pulverized, or powdered by force       Any material that contains  asbestos fibers can create a dangerous atmosphere of airborne minerals. By its basic nature, how it has been handled, or because it has been or will be broken up, it is likely to release those fibers and potentially create an atmosphere that is dangerous to human health. The danger of asbestos occurs when the material is crumbled, pulverized, or powdered, and these fibers can hang in the air for weeks if they are not contained at the same time. The remaining debris can also continue to spread fibers into the air if it is not kept contained all the way to a disposal site.  Containment  is the main focus of regulation.

At asbestos.com, our mission is two-fold: to educate the public about how to avoid the dangers of asbestos and to assist people who have already been diagnosed with asbestos-related diseases.  Our organization is staffed entirely by individuals who have, in one way or another, been affected by cancer.     Working off the principle that knowledge saves lives, we offer a one-stop resource on all issues concerning asbestos, from how to prevent exposure to what steps to take if diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease.  In contrast to other online sites, we offer advice on how to avoid asbestos exposure with hopes of preventing future unnecessary exposure.  Asbestos.com provides information on all prevention matters, such as where asbestos can be found in the home and workplace, how to identify asbestos-containing materials, and what to do with hazardous asbestos products.  We also provide the largest asbestos services directory on the web, which features lists of asbestos testing agencies as well as abatement companies.  Our site aims to simplify the often challenging task of finding the facts by providing multifaceted and comprehensive asbestos information in one place.     Dedicated to education and spreading awareness, Asbestos.com endeavors to team up with fire departments, municipalities, and other safety organizations across the nation.  Additionally, we highlight worthy charities devoted to helping asbestos-related disease.  Our organization is made possible by funding from attorneys across the country who have helped mesothelioma and asbestos victims and want to give back to the community.    For more than a decade, Asbestos.com has been revered as the leading online resource for all issues surrounding asbestos exposure and resulting diseases.  Our ultimate goal is to save lives and put an end to the asbestos epidemic by educating the public on the real and eminent dangers of asbestos.  Though most people are under the impression that asbestos is a concern of the past, we are committed to informing the public that asbestos is still a dangerous and prevalent problem that cannot be ignored any longer.

There are also shipyards along Mississippis riverfront and coast.  Shipyard workers and ship crewmen held jobs that virtually guaranteed asbestos exposure, as ship engine rooms and pipe systems were insulated with the material.  About thirty percent of all U.S. mesothelioma victims are veterans, and many of those are former Navy personnel that either sailed or repaired Navy ships built before 1985.   Mississippi also has its share of paper mills, like many of the southern states.  And then there is the construction industry, which until the mid 1980s was rife with asbestos-based products.  Not only home insulation but flooring, ceiling tiles, roofing and plumbing fittings were manufactured with asbestos as a component or were coated with asbestos for insulating purposes.  Carpenters and plumbers who were building during the twentieth century are included in the high at-risk job descriptions for mesothelioma.   Asbestosis and mesothelioma cancer are the result of inhaling asbestos fibers.  Because it can take twenty years or longer after asbestos exposure for the symptoms of mesothelioma to appear, many of the victims are men and women who worked in these industries for years and are now retired.  Tens of thousands of Americans have been affected; many of them have filed liability lawsuits against former employers and asbestos manufacturers.     Residents of Mississippi have that option as well.  Below is a partial list of jobsites that are believed to be possible locations for asbestos exposure.  If you worked in one of them and are now having lung problems, contact your doctor immediately.  If you believe you have a case for compensation, please contact us and we will see to it that your claim is filed and processed with all possible speed.

In 1999 the federal government began tracking mesothelioma deaths carefully.  Between 1999 and the end of 2004 there were one hundred reported deaths from mesothelioma.  The wave of asbestos related deaths is not done, however; it is expected to remain the same on an annual basis or increase slightly in the near future.     Cancer Treatment in Mississippi   Recently the National Cancer Institute designated forty one cancer treatment and research facilities across the country as comprehensive cancer centers that will work with the Institute on implementing research for new cancer treatments.  These centers will serve as resources for clinical trials of new treatments for various types of cancer, including mesothelioma.  The nearest one to Mississippi is in Alabama :   UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center  University of Alabama at Birmingham  1802 Sixth Avenue South, NP 2555 Birmingham, Alabama 35294-3300 Tel: (205) 934-5077 Fax: (205) 975-7428    There is an excellent regional cancer facility in Pascagoula, the first of its kind in the state:   Singing River Hospital System The Regional Cancer Center 2809 Denny Avenue  Pascagoula, MS 39581 http://www.srhshealth.com                                   Learn More   Important Topics       Asbestosis     Sources of Asbestos Exposure     Asbestos Lawsuits      COPD Symptoms      Mesothelioma       Mesothelioma Cancer     Malignant Mesothelioma     Abdominal Mesothelioma     Peritoneal Mesothelioma     Epithelial Mesothelioma     Pleural Mesothelioma     Pericardial Mesothelioma     Pleural Effusion     Lung Cancer      Legal Help       Mesothelioma Attorney     Mesothelioma Lawsuit       Medical Help       Mesothelioma Diagnosis     Mesothelioma Symptoms     Mesothelioma Treatment       Statistics       Mesothelioma deaths by industry     Mesothelioma deaths by occupation     Mesothelioma statistics                                              About Us          Request  Information          Settlements          Mesothelioma Legal           Lawsuit Info           Asbestos Articles          Asbestos by State           Sitemap         Links             Copyright 2001- 2008,  Asbestos News.com  offering Mesothelioma cancer & asbestos exposure news information.

Asbestos removal should only be performed by qualified professionals, since the risks associate with an improperly conducted asbestos removal are quite high.    There are over 3,000 manufactured products that are known to contain asbestos; asbestos removal can therefore be an extensive operation. Individuals may not realize their home or business requires asbestos removal, since asbestos fibers are odorless and tasteless and were used so widely for many years.  Asbestos removal  experts can conduct an investigation, taking samples of various materials to determine whether asbestos removal is required. Taking samples yourself is never recommended, as releasing asbestos fibers can be more dangerous than foregoing asbestos removal entirely. In some cases, asbestos abatement may be accomplished through methods other than asbestos removal, such as encasement or encapsulation. These can be as satisfactory and much less expensive than asbestos removal. There are stringent requirements set by federal, state, and local authorities regarding the methods for asbestos removal and disposal. Further information is available through organizations such as the  EPA  and  OSHA , and though asbestos removal laws do not vary much between states, individuals should always ensure that anyone hired for asbestos removal purposes is in full compliance with the laws and regulations. If an asbestos removal is occurring on a property that you rent, you can ask if the asbestos removal professionals have the proper training and qualifications. It is illegal to conduct an asbestos removal if you are anyone other than the property owner or a qualified asbestos removal specialist.    To learn more about your legal rights and responsibilities in regards to asbestos removal, you may wish to  contact an attorney  who has experience in working with asbestos removal cases.    To find buildings in your state that contain asbestos, select a state. You will also find  asbestos abatement  or asbestos removal, various statewide asbestos products, as well as links to how you might be able to help victims of Asbestos exposure.

The changing demographics within the United States have signaled to firms that diversity is an important goal that will affect the firm's viability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) Lack of Commitment at the top: In order for diversity initiatives to succeed, there must be vigorous support for it at the senior level of the firm or organization. Partners are the change agents of the firm. Committees formed to address issues of diversity, recruitment, retention and cultural competence must be lead by key leaders within the firm. 2) Failure to assess the firms environment: Assessment is critical in helping to create and implement an effective diversity initiative plan. Its critically important to understand an organizations level of development before launching a diversity or cultural competence initiative. Firms must be prepared to assess their hiring practices, overall culture, interpersonal relationships, views about diversity and promotion practices  3) Over emphasis on recruitment and hiring: Relying on recruitment as a primary means of creating diversity will prove to be an ineffective strategy. Instead, recruitment is simply an initial step in the overall process. Firms must ensure that their work environment can support a diverse staff. Next, firm-wide, culturally effective systems and practices must be implemented in order to prevent excessive attrition among women and attorneys of color. Retention and development of a strong and diverse pool of attorneys depends upon the firms ability to create a work environment that values and leverages difference, mentors cross culturally and consistently measures and monitors the progress and development of all attorneys. 4) Failure to include diversity objectives in the organizations strategic plan: Many firms fail to include diversity goals into the firms overall vision and plan for growth and development. Organizational change is a process and in order to successfully reach objectives related to diversity, goals must be included in the firms strategic plan. Firms successful in building a diverse workforce have implemented specific strategies in the areas of hiring, retention, professional development, communication, promotion, mentoring etc.  5) Lack of understanding of diversity phases: Many firms fail to view the creation of a diverse organization as a developmental process. Diversity and cultural competence develops along a continuum. In the early stages of the process, firms need to define diversity, identify problems and opportunities, provide education and awareness, and develop a leadership plan along with the business case for diversity, a clear vision and well defined goals. Finally firms must understand that building a diverse and inclusive work environment is an ongoing effort. 6) Ignoring the importance of training and development: Cultural competence and diversity training with a focus on building awareness and alliances vs. blaming and shaming is critical to creating a productive, diverse and inclusive workforce. Staff must have the opportunity to explore current views and misconceptions around issues of inclusiveness, race, gender, sexual orientation, religion and individuals with physical challenges. Failing to link training and development with firm-wide diversity objectives will result in the firms inability to build an inclusive and diverse organization. 7) Cultural Incompetence: Many firms communicate a desire to build an inclusive and diverse work environment yet they still place a high value on sameness. Whether consciously or subconsciously this value for sameness is communicated to others in the firm. Instead, firms need to develop a high level of cultural competency. Cultural competence requires that organizations:  "" Have a defined set of values and principles and demonstrate behaviors, attitudes, policies and structures that enable them to work effectively cross-culturally. "" Have the capacity to (1) value diversity, (2) conduct self-assessment, (3) manage, appreciate and leverage the dynamics of difference, (4) acquire and institutionalize cultural knowledge and (5) adapt to diversity and the cultural contexts of their employees and the clients and communities they represent. Think of cultural competence as fertile ground upon which to plant, grow and develop a successful recruitment, retention and firm wide cultural diversity program. Without the necessary foundation, efforts to build a diverse team of attorneys will prove to be unsatisfactory  About the Author: Jatrine Bentsi-Enchill, J.D., CPCC  is an attorney and the founder and director of the Esq.

Keep a positive attitude about your job search. Approach every interview as if it is your only one. Remember: you have the power to pick and choose because you have prepared yourself for this journey all your life! Your positivity should glow from you. You are the right candidate for the job position-prove it!       Attitude.  This is the key element to having a successful interview. There are many candidates just as, or more qualified than you, but you can beat them with a highly positive ""can do"" attitude about work. Attitude is how employers ""weed people out."" Attitudes are the impressions recruiters are left with long after meeting yoou and hundreds of other job candidates. In the interview, convey your great work attitude in the language that you use: mention your excellence and your positive attitude. Give examples of how you incorporate these things in your life and work environment, how you have put forth extra effort in past experiences, and how you have beat deadlines.       What is a positive work attitude?              Willingness to put forth your best work efforts - ""go   that extra mile""          Having the company's best interests at heart          Focus on the company's needs          Commitment and dedication to the need fulfillments of the   job and company          Striving for excellence          Reliability - can you be counted on at any time, any situation?          Team players             Practice.  Most college campuses have placement counselors who can take you through a ""mock"" interview for practice. This is a good way to get constructive criticism and feedback that can help you improve your interviewing skillss, style, and presentation. You need to practice answering interview questions live, verbally, out loud. If you can, videotape, so you can critique your ownself, too.                            Return to top of Career Services and Job Search                                               Pre-Interview Prep              Practice  - ""mock"" interview          Dress for Success  - tips on how to   dress for interviews                                       The Interview              Attitude  - what is a positive work   attitude?

According to             a report by the Institute for Policy Innovation (IPI), 141,030             of Americans currently unemployed can thank movie pirates for             the lack of job opportunities and the inability to share $5.5             billion in earnings.              -- JOBS - Absent piracy, 141,030 new jobs would have been             added to the U.S. economy. Of this total, 46, 597 jobs would             have been created in the motion picture industry while 94,433             jobs would have been added in other industries.              -- EARNINGS - Movie piracy costs U.S. workers $5.5 billion             annually in lost earnings. Of this amount, $1.9 billion would             have been earned by workers in the motion picture industries             while $3.6 billion would have been earned by workers in other             U.S. industries.              These findings are published in the IPI report ""The True             Cost of Motion Picture Piracy to the U.S. Economy""-the first             study to analyze the overall effect of the movie piracy upon             the overall economy.              ""One way lawmakers can help promote employment and help             Americans increase their income is by allocating sufficient resources             to protect intellectual property rights, particularly as they             relate to piracy and counterfeiting,"" said Stephen E. Siwek,             author of the IPI report and principal with Economists, Inc.              This analysis is the first in a series of intellectual property             papers examining the overall economic impact of copyright piracy             and patent infringement.

Statement of U.S. Labor       Secretary Elaine L. Chao on September Employment Numbers                   WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 /U.S. Newswire/ -- U.S. Secretary of Labor       Elaine L. Chao issued the following statement on the September       employment situation released today:          ""The news on the jobs front remains positive. The economy       is growing fast enough to create new jobs, but not so fast that       inflation is a big concern. Last month's payroll employment was       revised upward by 60,000. Benchmark revision to March 2006 payroll       employment was encouraging. This is a preliminary figure. The       benchmark shows that the economy created 810,000 more jobs in       the 12 months ending March 2006 than was originally thought.""          -----          U.S. Labor Department releases are accessible on the Internet       at http://www.dol.gov.

Dennis Hastert (R-IL) today issued the following remarks regarding       the U.S. Department of Labor's report showing the unemployment       rate dipping from 4.7 to 4.6 percent, and job growth holding       steady during the month of September following three straight       days of record-setting levels on Wall Street and a major decline       of gas prices.          ""American jobs grow while gas prices drop and the stock       market hits all-time highs. September's lower unemployment rate,       steady job growth and increased hourly earnings comes on the       heels of a record-setting week on Wall Street. This proves that       House Republicans' economic policies of tax relief continue to       show strong results. The hard work of House Republicans -- who       have remained committed to cutting spending and keeping taxes       low for American families -- continues to fuel the economic fire.       And the 51,000 jobs created in September represent that many       more Americans who are working and providing a better life for       their families.          ""The Democrats would rather talk down the economy with       the hopes of winning in November so they can raise taxes and       skyrocket spending. Meanwhile, House Republicans will stand together       to keep our record-setting economy soaring to new heights.""          Note: Average hourly earnings increased $0.04, or 0.2 percent,       to $16.84. That was up 4.0 percent from a year earlier.          http://www.usnewswire.com/                                                                                                                         New Ruling Undermines Economic Security for Workers Says the American Friends Service Committee             PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 6 /U.S/ Newswire/ -- The American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker organization with a long history of supporting labor rights, deplores the recent ruling by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) which will deny union protection to millions of American workers.       In its Oct. 3 decision in the Oakwood Healthcare Inc. case, the labor board allows employers to reclassify many workers as ""supervisors,"" thus denying them the right to be represented by unions. More than eight million workers and over 200 occupations could be affected, according to the Economic Policy Institute.       ""This ruling represents a serious effort to undermine economic security for American workers,"" said Joyce Miller, AFSC assistant general secretary for justice and human rights. ""Fair wages and the right to form and join a union are keys to achieving that security.""       AFSC is a cofounder of the ""Let Justice Roll"" Living Wage Campaign, a growing faith/labor/community coalition which will hold hundreds of rallies, religious services and prayer breakfasts in October to build support for raising the minimum wage.       In their dissent regarding the Oakwood case, two NLRB members warned: ""Today's decision threatens to create a new class of workers under Federal labor law: workers who have neither the genuine prerogatives of management, nor the statutory rights of ordinary employees. In that category may fall most professionals (among many other workers) who by 2012 could number almost 34 million, accounting for 23.3 percent of the workforce.""       The Service Committee has a long and rich history of supporting justice for coal miners, farm workers, maquila workers and others, dating to the 1920s. AFSC has also recently partnered with workers' organizations to promote just federal budget priorities and to oppose the privatization of Social Security.       According to Rick Wilson, director of the AFSC West Virginia Economic Justice Project, ""The labor movement has been vital to the preservation and extension of democracy to millions of workers. Attacking the right to organize not only harms those who are poor, it strikes a blow at middle-class Americans in a time of growing inequality.""       Wilson noted that union members generally enjoy higher wages (28.1 percent) and total compensation (43.7 percent) than non- union workers. They are more likely to be covered by health insurance and pensions and to have time off for paid vacations.       According to the AFL-CIO, under the Bush administration the NLRB has chipped away at workers' rights, limiting the eligibility of disabled workers, teaching assistants, temporary workers and others to join unions.

Another recent study suggests that within the next 2 years, over two-thirds of all rental property owners in the United States will increase their renting fees by as much as 35% to help offset the unexpected costs resulting from various tenant violations - ranging from property damage to unpaid renting fees.       Research shows, though, that properly screened employees will reduce, and in many cases eliminate employee theft. Also, properly screened rental tenants will significantly reduce tenant violations.       Inquest Direct is encouraging minority-owned businesses to take advantage of their screening services.

Today, in Ohio, Democratic candidate for President John Kerry and Leo Gerard, President of the United Steelworkers of America, began the day in Cleveland with workers at AKISG Steel and then traveled to Toledo where Kerry delivered a speech on jobs and the economy and received the endorsement of former Senator John Glenn.               In the speech, Kerry outlined his plan to address the outsourcing of American jobs. When Bush Council of Economic Advisors Chair N. Gregory Mankiw submitted the Administration’s economic report to Congress he called outsourcing ""just a new way of doing international trade"" and ""probably a plus for the economy in the long run.""  John Kerry disagrees. He believes that the job of a President is to fight for American jobs. Kerry has a plan to address the trend of U.S. jobs going overseas and to create jobs in America.       “Under this Administration, America’s middle class has been abandoned – its dreams denied, its Main Street interests ignored and its mainstream values scorned by a White House that puts privilege first,” said John Kerry. “Middle class Americans don’t ask for special favors, they just want basic fairness, and a President who fights for that ideal.”       “Next November, we can change all that,” Kerry continued.  “Because in a Kerry Administration, if you are doing your part and doing what’s right – whether you’re a CEO in the corner suite or a worker in an office or on the factory floor – you’ll have a President who honors you, respects your contribution, and who will fight for you and your future everyday.”       Manufacturing workers in Ohio have struggled to maintain their jobs and wages, losing 160,100 manufacturing jobs since George W. Bush took office.  And under George W. Bush’s plan to cut overtime pay, another 351,795 workers in Ohio would see their pay cut even as they spend more time away from their families.  With high unemployment and a declining manufacturing base, Ohio embodies the President’s failed economic policies.       While President Bush continues to send jobs overseas, today elected officials and labor leaders in the Super Tuesday states will continue to blitz the airwaves, visit job sites, hold rallies and roundtable meetings with workers to discuss John Kerry’s jobs plan.       Steelworkers’ President Leo Gerard, Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, Senators Ted Kennedy and Max Cleland, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Representatives Harold Ford Jr., Denise Majette, and John Larson are among the dozens of prominent supporters participating in the effort.  Participants will also release state-by-state reports detailing the state of their state under George Bush’s presidency.       Kerry has also launched an Internet component of the jobs tour at  www.johnkerry.com .  By clicking on their state on the election map, voters can see first-hand how President Bush’s policies have affected workers in their state.                            John Kerry Will Address Outsourcing by Requiring Companies to Fully Disclose Their Plans to Send Jobs Overseas             Give Workers Notice                      Kerry will   require companies to inform affected workers,  the Department   of Labor, state agencies responsible for helping laid off employees,   and local government officials; and        Kerry will require   companies to provide employees at least 3 months advance notice.             Collect Information to Understand Outsourcing              Kerry will require   the Department of Labor to compile statistics  of off-shored jobs by company   and report them on an annual basis to the Congress and the public;   and        Kerry will require   disclosure of how many jobs are affected , where the jobs are going, and   why they are being off-shored.        John Kerry will   also direct his Labor Secretary and National Economic Council   to examine these trends, their impact on U.S. jobs, and possible   actions to address them.  This data will allow consumers, businesses,   and workers to know which companies are outsourcing jobs and   where they are going to so that they can make informed decisions.             Keep Jobs in America              Use Government   Contracts for U.S. Workers.   Some states have begun outsourcing government   contracts. For example, New Jersey has outsourced government   services to help move people from welfare to work. The idea of   using taxpayer dollars to send entry-level service jobs overseas   to administer a program aimed at finding domestic entry-level   service jobs for welfare recipients makes no sense. John Kerry   believes that U.S. Federal contracts where possible should be   performed by American workers.  He will direct his Cabinet   Secretaries to look at procurement policies and assure wherever   possible Federal contracts are not bring outsourced overseas.        Stop Giving   Government Contracts to Corporations Breaking the Rules.   John Kerry will also make   sure the Federal government does not give lucrative contracts   to companies that have a record of accounting fraud – like   WorldCom – or are moving offshore.        Consumers “Right   to Know” on Call Center Workers.  In today’s economy, consumers increasingly   use the telephone or Internet to buy goods and services, inquire   about transactions and bills, and get technical support or other   information. More than 70 percent of customer interaction occurs   in call centers and an estimated 6 million Americans work in   call centers. In recent years, many call centers have shifted   operations overseas, to places like India, Vietnam, and the Philippines.   The US has lost 250,000 call center jobs since 2001. John Kerry   wants to keep jobs on the booming call center market here in   America, and help provide a measure of security for telephone   and Internet consumer transactions. He believes that consumers   should have a right to know where they are calling. The Federal   Trade Commission enforces standards to ensure commercial compliance   with “Made in USA” labeling.  Kerry believes a   “consumer’s right to know” should also apply the   same principles of disclosure to telephone- and Internet- mediated   customer service transactions.        End Every Single   Tax Credit That Gives Corporations Breaks for Moving Jobs Offshore.   John Kerry will close   every single loophole that gives companies incentives to move   jobs abroad, including stopping American companies from setting   up virtual headquarters in foreign countries just to avoid paying   U.S. taxes and stop tax breaks for companies that move jobs abroad.             Part of a Real Plan to Create Real Jobs:              A Tax Credit   to Create Manufacturing Jobs.  Bush has done nothing to end incentives that   encourage companies to move abroad. John Kerry supports a corporate   rate reduction for manufacturers who produce goods in the U.S.,   and he has proposed a new jobs tax credit to encourage manufacturing   companies to stay and expand in America.        More Jobs in   Small Business.    Bush is proposing to cut the Small Business Administration by   25 percent. John Kerry has a plan to make it easier for small   businesses to get capital and loans. He also has a health care   tax credit for small businesses and a comprehensive energy plan   that will help businesses cut costs.        Jobs Through   Energy Technology.    Bush’s energy plan is a handout to big oil and fails to   invest in the innovative energy technology of the future. John   Kerry has a plan to invest in renewable energy and technologies   that will create 500,000 jobs and make energy more affordable   for businesses.        Enforce Trade   Laws to Protect American Workers.  George Bush supported cuts to trade enforcement,   even though we need more enforcement to stop the drain on manufacturing   jobs. John Kerry will crack on countries that violate trade agreements   and will take action when American industries are hurt.        Make Sure Americans   Can Compete in 21st Century Economy.  In the 21st Century economy, many jobs will   require a college degree or beyond. That is why John Kerry has   a plan to make college as universal as high school with a tax   credit on the first $4,000 of tuition for each year of college.                   Reprinted from www.johnkerry.com                                          President Signs NASA Work Force Flexibility Act Into Law                             (2/25/04). NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe today expressed his appreciation to the President for signing into law a new act giving NASA greater flexibility to restructure and revitalize its work force. President George W. Bush yesterday signed the NASA Flexibility Act of 2004.                         ""I am very excited about this human capital legislation,"" said Administrator O'Keefe. ""With fewer students entering math and science studies, there's greater competition to attract those graduates who do make science and technology a career. This law now gives us additional tools to address the 21st century challenges we face in recruiting and retaining the exceptional talent required to carry out NASA's mission of exploration and discovery.""                NASA created a Human Capital Legislation Implementation Team in August to begin work on the many tasks that must be accomplished before using the new authorities provided in the act. The team also is leading the change-management initiatives underway to ensure effective communication with the entire NASA work force regarding the human capital legislation.                Sponsored by U.S. Senator George Voinovich (R-Ohio) and U.S. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert (R-N.Y.), the bill builds on existing law. Among other reforms, it provides the agency the ability to improve recruitment and retention, and to compete with the private sector. The legislation also establishes a Science and Technology Scholarship for Service Program, which provides financial assistance to students in exchange for a commitment to work for NASA.                 ""A quarter of our work force will be eligible to retire in a few years. We have to take creative steps to get students interested in these important fields and energize them about contributing to America's technology future,"" added Administrator O'Keefe. ""I appreciate the bipartisan congressional support this measure received and we look forward to working with the House, the Senate and the Administration as we move forward during this important time for the agency.""                The General Accounting Office has continued to rank ""strengthening human capital"" as one of NASA's top management challenges. The agency's over-60 science and engineering work force outnumbers its under-30 employees by nearly 3-to-1. The potential departure of these individuals represents a dramatic loss of knowledge, experience and leadership.                The bill adheres to existing merit principles, veterans' preference and equal employment opportunity guidelines, as well as supports the rights of labor organizations. NASA involved its unions, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), in pursuing this important legislation. Last year, the IFPTE, NASA's largest union, endorsed the measure.                Additional information about this NASA initiative is available on the Internet at:                    http://nasapeople.nasa.gov/hclwp/index.htm             Reprinted from NASA's website. www.nasa.gov                                                                                              2003 Graduates Face       a Tough Job Market With the Unemployment Rate at a Record High       of                     5-13-03.       Many factors have indicated that the job market is less than       ideal for many of this year's graduates. Landing a job will depend       on flexibility and persistence. With the job market being tougher       than usual and slow, many graduates are opting to continue on       to graduate school.. A willingness to move and taking a less-than-ideal       starting position helped some graduates land jobs in the workforce.          According to the National       Association of Colleges and Employers, the hiring of college       graduates will be ""stagnant.""                                                                                                                                              NBPRS       CELEBRATES 20 YEARS WITH CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK                   New       York, NY  - (9/17/03).The       National Black Public Relations Society (NBPRS) will convene       its Fifth Annual National Conference and Career Fair in New York       at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers on October 2-5, 2003.       This year's theme, ""Public Relations-Technology Driven,       Diversity Focused,"" reflects the commitment of public relations       professionals to recognize the sweeping transformation of the       world and their commitment to educating the public to options       in the new information arena. Workshops will include sessions       on government contracting, entertainment media relations, advanced       degrees and career development. The Career Fair will showcase       job opportunities, internships, programs and services designed       for attendees.          Also       included will be the Founders' Award presentation to Michelle       Flowers of Chicago-based Flowers Communications. Ms. Flowers       will be recognized for her dedicated advocacy of diversity within       the ranks of the public relations indus  "

Welcome to Virginia!   Here at DMV, we're excited to help you get on the road. These steps will give you the information you need to drive on Virginia's highways.   Apply for a Virginia driver's license    Information you need to review/study to obtain a driver's license  Eligibility Requirements   Applying for a Virginia License   Virginia Driver's Manual   Acceptable Documents for Obtaining a Driver's License or Photo Identification Card ( DMV 141 )           Obtain a vehicle safety inspection sticker     To ensure that your vehicle is mechanically safe to operate on the highways of the Commonwealth, it must pass an annual vehicle safety inspection.  For information about the safety inspection and the nearest location of a safety inspections station, visit  Va State Police - Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection Program .     Meet Virginia's emissions inspection standards  (your vehicle must meet Virginia's emissions standards when you register it)     Your vehicle must pass an emissions inspection before registration if garaged in the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William, or Stafford, or the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas, or Manassas Park.     If your vehicle is being registered for the first time in Virginia and has a current  valid emissions certificate (performed in the last 12 months) from one of the  following states, it may be titled and registered without a Virginia emissions  inspection:  Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Georgia,  Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,  Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, or Wisconsin.     Emissions inspections in Virginia are valid for two years and may be obtained by having your vehicle inspected at a certified emissions  inspection station .  When you have your vehicle inspected in Virginia, the emissions station will update your vehicle record at DMV.      Your emissions inspection should not cost more than $28.  Vehicles subject to the emissions program will be charged an additional $2 per year at the time of registration.  This fee is used to cover the cost of the emissions inspection program. For additional information about emissions inspections and the locations of inspection stations, contact the  Department of Environment Quality  at (703)583-3900 or toll free in Virginia at 1-800-275-3844.    Meet Virginia's vehicle insurance requirements  (your vehicle must be insured when you register it)     To protect our citizens, Virginia law requires the following minimum  insurance coverage  for all registered vehicles.           $25,000 for bodily injury or death of one person;   $50,000 for bodily injury or death of two or more people; and    $20,000 for property damage.          Or, if insurance is not an option, pay a $500  uninsured motor vehicle fee  (UMV). Paying this fee does not provide insurance coverage, but it does allow you to register and operate your vehicle in Virginia for one year.               If you register your vehicle in Virginia and it's not covered by liability insurance and you do not pay the UMV fee, you face a $500 fine, suspension of your driver's license and vehicle registration(s), and higher insurance premiums for the next three years. Whenever you obtain or cancel a liability policy, or add or remove a vehicle from a policy, the insurance company notifies DMV immediately.  Why take chances?  Get insurance on your vehicle  before  you register it.    From the moment you register your vehicle to the day the registration period expires, your vehicle must be covered by a liability policy issued by an insurance company licensed to do business in Virginia - even if the vehicle is not working or not being used.    Remember, if you sell, trade or dispose of your vehicle, be sure to notify DMV if you want to transfer the license plates to another insured vehicle.  If you do not want to transfer your license plates, please return them to any DMV customer service center before you cancel your insurance. Failure to comply with Virginia's insurance law will result in fines, suspension of your driver's license, and cancellation of the registrations on all vehicles that you own or co-own.         Title your vehicle in Virginia (do this within 30 days of moving to Virginia)       To register your vehicle in Virginia and obtain license plates, you must first  title your vehicle  within 30 days of moving to Virginia.      Register your vehicle and acquire license plates  (do this within 30 days of moving to Virginia)     Application and  fees After you have insured and titled it,  register your vehicle  at any Virginia DMV  customer service center .  Your registration fee is determined by:    the empty weight or gross weight of your vehicle,   the type of license plate you purchase ( see special license plates section ), and  the period of time, one or two years, you choose to register your vehicle.      A two-year registration costs twice the annual fee and provides added convenience for our customers.      * The two-year renewal option is  not  available for vehicles with a gross weight of 55,000 pounds or more, vehicles registered under the International Registration Plan or uninsured vehicles.     As a courtesy, DMV will mail renewal reminders to you prior to the expiration date of your registration.  To receive reminders on time, be sure to update your address with DMV.  You can renew your vehicle registration online, by touchtone telephone or mail.       Keep the registration card with you whenever you operate the vehicle.      License Plates  DMV will issue you two license plates, two decals showing the expiration date, and a registration card. Place the decals as indicated on the plates.  Place the plates on the front and rear of your vehicle so that they are securely fastened and clearly visible.  If your vehicle is a motorcycle, DMV will issue you just one license plate for the vehicle.      It is illegal to mount license plates frames, colored glass, plastic or any other type of covering on your license plates that alters or obscures the letters, numbers, decals or the state where the vehicle is registered, and when the registration expires.    Obtain a local sticker or decal from your locality  (do this within 30 days of moving to Virginia)     The locality in which you live may require you to register the vehicle.   Contact your    locality  to find information for your local Commissioner of the Revenue, Treasurer or Director of Finance.     Other considerations    Voter registration  is available at any DMV office.    If your vehicle has tinted windows, make sure the tinting complies with Virginia's  sunshading specifications . DMV is authorized to issue waivers to individuals who have medical conditions requiring restriction from sunlight or bright artificial light.    If you are a male U. S. citizen living in the U. S. or abroad or a male immigrant (permanent resident alien) residing in the U. S., and you are age 18 through 25, you are required to register with the  Selective Service System .

Welcome to Virginia!   Here at DMV, we're excited to help you get on the road. These steps will give you the information you need to drive on Virginia's highways.   Apply for a Virginia driver's license    Information you need to review/study to obtain a driver's license  Eligibility Requirements   Applying for a Virginia License   Virginia Driver's Manual   Acceptable Documents for Obtaining a Driver's License or Photo Identification Card ( DMV 141 )           Obtain a vehicle safety inspection sticker     To ensure that your vehicle is mechanically safe to operate on the highways of the Commonwealth, it must pass an annual vehicle safety inspection.  For information about the safety inspection and the nearest location of a safety inspections station, visit  Va State Police - Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection Program .     Meet Virginia's emissions inspection standards  (your vehicle must meet Virginia's emissions standards when you register it)     Your vehicle must pass an emissions inspection before registration if garaged in the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William, or Stafford, or the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas, or Manassas Park.     If your vehicle is being registered for the first time in Virginia and has a current  valid emissions certificate (performed in the last 12 months) from one of the  following states, it may be titled and registered without a Virginia emissions  inspection:  Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Georgia,  Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,  Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, or Wisconsin.     Emissions inspections in Virginia are valid for two years and may be obtained by having your vehicle inspected at a certified emissions  inspection station .  When you have your vehicle inspected in Virginia, the emissions station will update your vehicle record at DMV.      Your emissions inspection should not cost more than $28.  Vehicles subject to the emissions program will be charged an additional $2 per year at the time of registration.  This fee is used to cover the cost of the emissions inspection program. For additional information about emissions inspections and the locations of inspection stations, contact the  Department of Environment Quality  at (703)583-3900 or toll free in Virginia at 1-800-275-3844.    Meet Virginia's vehicle insurance requirements  (your vehicle must be insured when you register it)     To protect our citizens, Virginia law requires the following minimum  insurance coverage  for all registered vehicles.           $25,000 for bodily injury or death of one person;   $50,000 for bodily injury or death of two or more people; and    $20,000 for property damage.          Or, if insurance is not an option, pay a $500  uninsured motor vehicle fee  (UMV). Paying this fee does not provide insurance coverage, but it does allow you to register and operate your vehicle in Virginia for one year.               If you register your vehicle in Virginia and it's not covered by liability insurance and you do not pay the UMV fee, you face a $500 fine, suspension of your driver's license and vehicle registration(s), and higher insurance premiums for the next three years. Whenever you obtain or cancel a liability policy, or add or remove a vehicle from a policy, the insurance company notifies DMV immediately.  Why take chances?  Get insurance on your vehicle  before  you register it.    From the moment you register your vehicle to the day the registration period expires, your vehicle must be covered by a liability policy issued by an insurance company licensed to do business in Virginia - even if the vehicle is not working or not being used.    Remember, if you sell, trade or dispose of your vehicle, be sure to notify DMV if you want to transfer the license plates to another insured vehicle.  If you do not want to transfer your license plates, please return them to any DMV customer service center before you cancel your insurance. Failure to comply with Virginia's insurance law will result in fines, suspension of your driver's license, and cancellation of the registrations on all vehicles that you own or co-own.         Title your vehicle in Virginia (do this within 30 days of moving to Virginia)       To register your vehicle in Virginia and obtain license plates, you must first  title your vehicle  within 30 days of moving to Virginia.      Register your vehicle and acquire license plates  (do this within 30 days of moving to Virginia)     Application and  fees After you have insured and titled it,  register your vehicle  at any Virginia DMV  customer service center .  Your registration fee is determined by:    the empty weight or gross weight of your vehicle,   the type of license plate you purchase ( see special license plates section ), and  the period of time, one or two years, you choose to register your vehicle.      A two-year registration costs twice the annual fee and provides added convenience for our customers.      * The two-year renewal option is  not  available for vehicles with a gross weight of 55,000 pounds or more, vehicles registered under the International Registration Plan or uninsured vehicles.     As a courtesy, DMV will mail renewal reminders to you prior to the expiration date of your registration.  To receive reminders on time, be sure to update your address with DMV.  You can renew your vehicle registration online, by touchtone telephone or mail.       Keep the registration card with you whenever you operate the vehicle.      License Plates  DMV will issue you two license plates, two decals showing the expiration date, and a registration card. Place the decals as indicated on the plates.  Place the plates on the front and rear of your vehicle so that they are securely fastened and clearly visible.  If your vehicle is a motorcycle, DMV will issue you just one license plate for the vehicle.      It is illegal to mount license plates frames, colored glass, plastic or any other type of covering on your license plates that alters or obscures the letters, numbers, decals or the state where the vehicle is registered, and when the registration expires.    Obtain a local sticker or decal from your locality  (do this within 30 days of moving to Virginia)     The locality in which you live may require you to register the vehicle.   Contact your    locality  to find information for your local Commissioner of the Revenue, Treasurer or Director of Finance.     Other considerations    Voter registration  is available at any DMV office.    If your vehicle has tinted windows, make sure the tinting complies with Virginia's  sunshading specifications . DMV is authorized to issue waivers to individuals who have medical conditions requiring restriction from sunlight or bright artificial light.    If you are a male U. S. citizen living in the U. S. or abroad or a male immigrant (permanent resident alien) residing in the U. S., and you are age 18 through 25, you are required to register with the  Selective Service System .

A  sales tax  is a tax on  consumption , which is displayed as a  percentage  of the sale price. Sales taxes are assessed by every  state  except Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon. Hawaii has a similar  tax  although it is charged to businesses instead of consumers. In some cases, sales taxes are also assessed at the  county  or  municipal  level.   The sales tax is the responsibility of the merchant to collect and remand to the state, and stated separately (or implicitly added at the time of sale) to consumers. Usually only consumers are charged the tax; resellers are exempt if they do not make use of the goods. In some jurisdictions, a reseller's certificate is required to make use of this privilege. This is in contrast to a  Value Added Tax  (VAT), where resellers are also taxed (resellers may then claim the VAT paid on their purchases from the applicable authority). States which have exemptions for specific types of organizations (such as schools), may also require a certificate. A  sales tax audit  is the examination of a companys financial documents by the states tax agency to verify if they have collected the correct amount of sales tax from their customers.   The  Constitution of the United States  limits the power of the states to subjects within their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction over interstate commerce is reserved to the federal government. Nevertheless, a  resident  of a state with a sales tax who purchases goods from a place with no sales tax (or at a lower rate) might be subject to pay a "" use tax "" (often at the same rate as the state sales tax) for non-exempt purchases  (see also  tax-free shopping ) . While there is no  national sales tax  in the United States, the  Fair Tax Act , which would replace  federal income taxes  with a sales tax and monthly rebate, has attracted interest in the  United States Congress  and the  2008 presidential campaign .

Georgia passed legislation enacting a sales tax in 1929. 11 other states enacted sales taxes in 1933 alone. By 1940, at least 30 states had a sales tax. [ 1 ]  Currently, 45 of the 50 U.S. States levy a sales and use tax against purchases.  [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   States and federal districts     [ edit ]   Alabama   Alabama  has a state general sales tax of 4%, plus any additional local taxes which can amount to a combined total sales tax of up to 10% in some cities such as Montgomery. Alabama is one of several states that do not exempt food from state taxes. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Alaska   There is no state sales tax in  Alaska ; however, local governments (boroughs and their municipalities) may levy up to 7%, and 108 of them do so. [ 4 ]  Municipal sales taxes are collected in addition to borough sales taxes, if any. Regulations and exemptions vary widely across the state. [ 5 ]   Anchorage  and  Fairbanks  do not charge a local sales tax.     [ edit ]   Arizona   Arizona  has a  transaction privilege tax (TPT)  that differs from a ""true"" sales tax in that the tax is levied on the gross receipts of the vendor and is not a liability of the consumer. [ 6 ]  (As explained in Arizona Administrative Code rule R15-5-2202, [ 7 ]  vendors are permitted to pass the amount of the tax on to the consumer, but remain the liable parties for the tax to the state.) TPT is imposed under sixteen tax classifications (as of November 1, 2006), [ 8 ]  with the tax rate most commonly encountered by Arizona consumers (e.g., for retail transactions) set at 5.6%. The current tax as of 2009 is 6.1%, [ 9 ]  though cities and counties can add as much as 6% to the total rate. [ 10 ]  Food for home consumption and prescription drugs (including  legend drugs  and certain prescribed  homeopathic medication ) are two of many items of tangible personal property that are statutorily exempt from the retail TPT. Arizona's TPT is one of the few excise taxes in the country imposed on contracting activities rather than sales of construction materials. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Arkansas   Arkansas  has a state sales tax of 6%, plus any additional local taxes.   Effective  July 1 ,  2007 , Arkansas state sales tax on unprepared food (groceries) reduced to 3%. Local sales taxes on groceries remained unchanged.     [ edit ]   California   California  has a statewide sales tax of 7.25%, and local supplementary taxes are allowed up to 9.25%. Sales and use taxes in the state of California are collected by the publicly elected tax commission in the United States. The statewide 7.25% is allocated as: [ 12 ]     7.25% - State    5.00% - State - General Fund   0.25% - State - Fiscal Recovery Fund   0.50% - State - Local Revenue Fund   0.50% - State - Local Public Safety Fund   1.00% -  Uniform Local Tax     0.25% - Local County - Transportation funds   0.75% - Local City/County - Operational funds             On April 1, 2009 the state sales and use tax will increase by 1% as a result of the  2008-2009 California budget crisis . The minimum sales tax statewide will be 8.25%. [ 13 ] [ 14 ]   Supplementary sales tax may be added (with voter approval) by cities, counties, service authorities, and various special districts (such as the  Bay Area Rapid Transit  district). The effect is that sales tax rates vary from 7.25% (in areas where no additional taxes are charged) to 8.75% (for example, in the city of  Avalon , on  Santa Catalina Island , in  National City , and in  Alameda County ). On Oct. 1, 2008, the city of  South Gate  increased their sales-tax rate to 9.25%, the highest in California. [ 15 ]   The last changes to the published local tax rates took effect on  April 1 ,  2007 . Official updates are published on the Board of Equalization website and also in Publication 71. [ 16 ] [ 17 ]   In general, sales tax is required on all purchases of tangible personal property to its ultimate consumer. Services are not subject to sales tax (but may be subject to other taxes).   Vehicle purchases are taxed based on the city and county in which the purchaser registers the vehicle, and not on the county in which the vehicle is purchased. There is therefore no advantage in purchasing a car in a cheaper county to save on sales tax (a one-percent difference in sales tax rate would otherwise result in an additional $300 loss on a $30,000 car).   In grocery stores, unprepared food items are not taxed but vitamins and all other items are. Ready-to-eat hot foods, whether sold by supermarkets or other vendors, are taxed. Restaurant bills are taxed. As an exception, hot beverages and bakery items are tax-exempt if and only if they are for take-out and are not sold with any other hot food. If consumed on the seller's premises, such items are taxed like restaurant meals. All other food is exempt from sales tax.   Also excluded are food animals (livestock), food plants and seeds, fertilizer used to grow food, prescription drugs and certain medical supplies, energy utilities, certain alternative energy devices and supplies, art for display by public agencies, and veterans' pins. There are many specific exemptions for various veterans', non-profit, educational, religious, and youth organizations. Sale of items to certain out-of-state or national entities (mostly transportation companies) is exempt, as are some goods sold while in transit through California to a foreign destination.   Occasional or one-time sales not part of a regular business are exempt, except that sales of three or more non-food animals (puppies, kittens, etc.) per year are taxed.  [ 18 ]   There are also exemptions for numerous specific products, from telephone lines and poles, to liquid petroleum gas for farm machinery, to coins, to public transit vehicles. There are  partial  exemptions for such varied items as racehorse breeding stock, teleproduction service equipment, farm machinery, and timber-harvesting equipment. [ 19 ]  For an organized list of exemptions, with estimates for how much revenue the state loses and the people saves for each, see Publication 61 of the Board of Equalization. [ 20 ]   Sales tax is charged on gasoline. The tax is levied on both the gasoline and on the federal and state excise taxes, resulting in double taxation. The sales tax is included in the metered price at the pump. The California excise tax on gasoline is 18 cents a gallon. [ 21 ]   Motor vehicle gasoline and jet fuel are subject to special taxation regimes. In 2005, there was a political dispute in the San Francisco Bay Area about whether revenues for jet fuel should be credited to  San Mateo County  (where  San Francisco International Airport  is physically located), the City and County of  San Francisco , which owns the airport, or  Alameda County , where  Oakland International Airport  is located. (The distinction is largely point of delivery vs. point of negotiation for the sale.) This is controlled by Regulation 1802, [ 22 ]  which has other provisions about businesses which have multiple locations.   Critics of the current sales tax regime charge that it gives local governments an incentive to promote commercial development (through zoning and other regulations) over residential development, including the use of eminent domain condemnation proceedings to transfer real estate to higher sales tax generating businesses. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Colorado   Colorado 's state sales tax is 2.9% with some cities and counties levying additional taxes.  Denver 's tangibles tax is 3.62%, with food eaten away from the home being taxed at 4%. There is also a football stadium tax, mass transit tax, and scientific and cultural facilities tax. Most transactions in Denver and the surrounding area are taxed at a total of about 8%. Colorado does not charge sales tax on unprepared food (groceries).     [ edit ]   Connecticut   Connecticut  has a 6% sales tax, with no additional local taxes. Most non-prepared food products are exempt, as are most prescription and nonprescription medications, all internet services, all magazine and newspaper subscriptions, and textbooks (for college students only). Most clothing costing less than $50 per item is also exempt; items costing more than $50 are charged sales tax on the entire price. [ 24 ]   Shipping and delivery charges (including charges for U.S. postage) made by a retailer to a customer are subject to sales and use taxes when provided in connection with the sales of taxable tangible personal property or services. The tax applies even if the charges are separately stated and applies regardless of whether the shipping or delivery is provided by the seller or by a third party. No tax is due on shipping and delivery charges in connection with any sale that is not subject to sales or use tax. Shipping or delivery charges related to sales for resale or sales of exempt items are not taxable. Likewise, charges for mailing or delivery services are not subject to tax if they are made in connection with the sale of nontaxable services. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Delaware   Delaware does not assess a sales tax on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096 percent to 1.92 percent, depending upon the category of business activity.     [ edit ]   District of Columbia   Washington, D.C.  has a sales tax rate of 5.75%. The tax is imposed on sale of tangible personal property and selected services. A 9% tax is imposed on liquor sold for off premises consumption, 10% on restaurant meals and rental cars, 12% on parking, and 14% on hotel accommodations. Groceries, prescription and non-prescription drugs, and residential utilities services are exempt from the District's sales tax.  [ 26 ]   The District has two sales tax holidays each year, one during ""back-to-school"" and one preceding the holiday shopping season. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Florida   Florida  has a general sales tax rate of 6%. [ 28 ]  The tax is imposed on the sale or rental of goods, the sale of admissions, the lease, license, or rental of real property, the lease or rental of transient living accommodations, and the sale of a limited number of services such as commercial pest control, commercial cleaning, and certain protection services. There are a variety of exemptions from the tax, including groceries and prescriptions. [ 29 ]   A ""discretionary sales surtax"" may be imposed by the counties of up to 1.5%, charged at the rate of the destination county (if shipped). This is 1% in most counties, 0.5% in many, 1.5% in very few, and 0.25% in one county. A few have none at all. Most have an  expiration date , but a few do not. Only the first $5,000 of a large purchase is subject to the surtax rate. [ 30 ]  Most counties levy the surtax for education or transportation improvements.   There are annual sales tax holidays, such as a back-to-school holiday on clothing, books, and school supplies under a certain price, as well as a new one in June 2007 to promote  hurricane preparedness . The 2008 Legislators did not enact any sales tax holidays.   Florida also permits counties to raise a ""tourist development tax"" of up to an additional 6% on hotel rooms.     [ edit ]   Georgia   Georgia  has a 4% state sales tax rate. Groceries are exempt from the state sales tax, but still subject to tax by the local sales tax rate. Counties may impose local sales tax of 1%, 2%, or 3%, consisting of up to three 1% local-option sales taxes (out of a set of five) as permitted by Georgia law. These include a  SPLOST , a  homestead exemption  (HOST), and one for  public schools  which can be put forth for a  referendum  by the  school board  instead of the  county commission  (in cooperation with its  city councils ). Also, the city of  Atlanta  imposes an additional 1% municipal-option sales tax (MOST), as allowed by  special legislation  of the  Georgia General Assembly , solely for the purpose of fixing its  water  and  sewerage  systems.   As of July 2008, total sales tax rates in Georgia are 3% for groceries and 7% for other items in the vast majority of  its 159 counties . A few counties charge only 2% local tax (6% total on non-grocery items), and four partially exempt groceries from the local tax by charging 2% on food, and 3% (7% total) on other items. Fulton and DeKalb counties charge 1% for  MARTA , and adjacent  metro Atlanta  counties may do so by referendum if they so choose. For the portions of Fulton and DeKalb within the city of Atlanta, the total is at 8% (4% on groceries) due to the MOST. [ 31 ]   Similar to Florida and certain other states, Georgia has two sales tax holidays per year. One is for  back-to-school  sales the first weekend in August, but sometimes starting at the end of July. A second usually occurs in October, for  energy-efficient   appliances  with the  Energy Star   certification .   Georgia has many exemptions available to specific businesses and industries. To identify potential exemptions, businesses and consumers must research the laws and rules for sales and use tax and review current exemption forms.  [ 32 ]     [ edit ]   Hawaii   Hawaii  does not have a sales tax, but it does have an  excise tax  which applies to nearly every conceivable type of  transaction  (including  services ), and is technically charged to the  business  rather than the  consumer . Unlike other states, businesses may or may not show the tax separately on the  receipt , as it is technically part of the selling price. 4.0% is charged at  retail  with an additional 0.5% surcharge in the  City and County of Honolulu  (for a total of 4.5% on Oahu sales), and 0.5% is charged on  wholesale   [7] . However the state also allows ""tax on tax"" to be charged, which effectively means a customer is billed 4.166% (4.712% on Oahu). The exact dollar or percentage amount to be added must be quoted to customers within or along with the price. The 0.5% surcharge on Oahu was implemented to fund the new rail transport system.  [ 33 ]  The use of an excise tax means that  tax-exempt   non-profit organizations  must pay the tax, unlike states where they are exempt from sales taxes.     [ edit ]   Idaho   Idaho  has a 6.0% state sales tax. Some localities levy an additional local sales tax. [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   Illinois   Illinois'  sales and use tax scheme includes four major divisions. Retailers' Occupation Tax, Use Tax, Service Occupation Tax and the Service Use Tax. Each of these taxes is administered by the Illinois Department of Revenue. The Retailers' Occupation Tax is imposed upon persons engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property to purchasers for use or consumption. It is measured by the gross receipts of the retailer. The base rate of 6.25% is broken down as follows: 5% State, 1% City, 0.25% County. Local governments may impose additional tax resulting in a combined rate that ranges from the State minimum of 6.25% to a current high of 11.50% in certain business districts in Cook County. [ 35 ] . A complementary Use Tax is imposed upon the privilege of using or consuming property purchased anywhere at retail from a retailer. Illinois registered retailers are authorized to collect the Use Tax from their customers and use it to offset their obligations under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. Since the Use Tax rate is equivalent to the corresponding Retailers' Occupation Tax rate, the amount collected by the retailer matches the amount the retailer must submit to the Illinois Department of Revenue. The combination of these two taxes is what is commonly referred to as ""sales tax"". If the purchaser does not pay the Use Tax directly to a retailer (for instance, on an item purchased from an Internet seller), they must remit it directly to the Illinois Department of Revenue. [ 36 ]   The Service Occupation Tax is imposed upon the privilege of engaging in service businesses and is measured by the selling price of tangible personal property transferred as an incident to providing a service. The Service Use Tax is imposed upon the privilege of using or consuming tangible personal property transferred as an incident to the provision of a service. An example would be a printer of business cards. The printer owes Service Occupation Tax on the value of the paper and ink transferred to the customer in the form of printed business cards. The serviceperson may satisfy this tax by paying Use Tax to his supplier of paper and ink or, alternatively, may charge Service Use Tax to the purchaser of the business cards and remit the amount collected as Service Occupation Tax on the serviceperson's tax return. The service itself, however, is not subject to tax.   Qualifying food, drugs, medicines and medical appliances [ 37 ]  have sales tax of 1% plus local home rule tax depending on the location where purchased. Newspapers and magazines are exempt from sales tax as are legal tender, currency, medallions, bullion or gold or silver coinage issued by the State of Illinois, the government of the United States of America, or the government of any foreign country.   Illinois' system is exceptionally complicated. A brief overview is detailed on the Illinois Department of Revenue website. [ 38 ]   The city of Chicago has the highest total sales tax of all major U.S. cities. [ 39 ]  It is also one of the most complex. 10.25% is levied on all non-perishable goods purchased, while 2% is levied on qualifying food, drugs, medicines and medical appliances. [ 39 ]  The Illinois Department of Revenue collects a 3% Chicago Soft Drink Tax and a 1%  Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority  (MPEA) ""Food and Beverage Tax"", on prepared food and beverage purchases in the downtown area (These ""downtown"" boundaries are: Surf Street on the north, Ashland Avenue on the west, Stevenson Expressway (I-55) on the south, & Lake Michigan on the east. Furthermore, O'Hare and Midway airports also fall under the 1% MPEA tax district). [ 40 ]  In addition, the Chicago Department of Revenue collects additional sales taxes on items such as fountain drinks, bottled water, liquor, and cigarettes. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Indiana   Indiana  has a 7% state sales tax. The tax rate was raised from 6% on  April 1 ,  2008 , to offset the loss of revenue from the statewide property tax reform, which is expected to significantly lower property taxes. Untaxed retail items include medications, water, ice and unprepared, raw staple foods or fruit juices. Many localities, inclusive of either counties or cities, in the state of Indiana also have a sales tax on restaurant food and beverages consumed in the restaurant or purchased to go. Revenues are usually used for economic development and tourism projects. This additional tax rate may be 1% or 2% or other amounts depending on the county in which the business is located. For example, in  Marion County, Indiana , the sales tax for restaurants is 9%.     [ edit ]   Iowa   As of July 1, 2008,  Iowa  has a 6% state sales tax. Most counties impose local option sales taxes of up to 1% each, bringing the total up to 7%. There is no tax on most unprepared food, excluding corn. The Iowa Department of Revenue provides information about local option sales taxes, [ 42 ]  including sales tax rate lookup.     [ edit ]   Kansas   Kansas  has a 5.3% state sales tax. More than 700 jurisdictions within the state (cities, counties, and special districts) may impose additional taxes. For example, in the capital city of  Topeka , retailers must collect 5.3% for the state, 1.15% for  Shawnee County , and 1% for the city, for a total rate of 7.45%. As of February 2007, the highest rate was 8.65%, in the  Roeland Park  Transportation District.     [ edit ]   Kentucky   Kentucky  has a 6% state sales tax. Alcohol (until April 1, 2009) and most staple grocery foods are exempt.     [ edit ]   Louisiana   Louisiana  has a 4% state sales tax: 3.97% to sales tax and .03% to Louisiana tourism district. [ 43 ]  There are also taxes on the  parish  (county) level and some on the city levels. [ 44 ]  Parishes may add local taxes up to 5%, while local jurisdictions within parishes may add more. Louisiana also bids out sales tax audits to private companies, with many being paid on a percentage collected basis.   Orleans Parish collects the maximum 5% tax rate for a total of 9% on general purpose items. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Maine   Maine  has a 5% general, service provider and use tax. [ 46 ]  The tax on lodging and prepared food is 7% and short term auto rental is 10%. These are all generally known as ""sales tax"".     [ edit ]   Maryland   Maryland  has a 6% state sales and use tax as of  January 3 ,  2008  (it was 5% before this), with exceptions for medicine, residential energy, and most non-prepared foods. Currently, many services (e.g., auto repair labor, haircuts, accounting) are not taxed. With this tax increase, Maryland added sales tax on Internet purchases and other mail items such as magazine subscriptions. Clothing is also taxable.   Certain computer services were to be subject to sales tax and use tax effective July 1, 2008 after being approved without public hearing during the 2007 Special Legislative Session. [ 47 ]  However, after effective lobbying by computer services professionals, the tax was repealed April 6th during the final days of the General Assembly. Following declining approval ratings and intense public pressure, Governor  Martin O'Malley  relented and authorized the repeal.     [ edit ]   Massachusetts   Massachusetts  has a 5% sales tax, replete with numerous exceptions including (among other things): ""food products"" (but excluding prepared meals); residential water, gas, electric services; returnable containers, clothing and footwear up to $175 (for clothing over $175, tax is due only on the amount over $175 per item [ 48 ] ); prescription medicines, prostheses and medical appliances or services; publications for use in education or religious worship; poultry and livestock, as well as their feed; fruit and vegetable stock for generating food for humans; tools, machinery, parts, etc., for use in agriculture; cloth or other materials used for making clothing; residential heat pump, solar or wind power system; items purchasable with federal food stamps; the American Flag; etc. An enacted change in 2006 taxes computer software that is downloaded for use in Massachusetts, whereas previously this was viewed as a non-taxable ""service"". [ 49 ]   Every year since 2004, the State Government has enacted tax holidays suspending the sales tax on purchases for one weekend in August. Motor vehicles, motorboats, meals, telecommunications services, gas, steam, electricity, tobacco products, and any single item with a price exceeding $2,500 were excluded from the holiday.

Michigan also has recently introduced a business tax called the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) which replaces the Single Business Tax (SBT). [ 53 ]     [ edit ]   Minnesota   Minnesota  currently has a 6.5% state sales tax. A statewide referendum passed on Nov. 4, 2008 which will add 3/8 of 1 percent, bringing the total to 6.875%. The new rate will go into effect on July 1, 2009. [ 54 ]  As of  July 1 ,  2008 , an additional 0.25%  Transit Improvement tax  was phased in across five counties in the  Minneapolis-St. Paul  metropolitan area for transit development.

Transportation Development Districts and Museum Districts may impose sales tax (but not use tax) up to 1%, in addition to all other sales taxes. However, the Missouri Department of Revenue does not administer sales tax for these districts, nor does it publish their sales tax rates. As of August 2007, there is no public, comprehensive and complete list of these districts, their locations, and the sales tax rates they impose.     [ edit ]   Montana   Montana  does not have a state sales tax but some municipalities which are big tourist destinations, such as  Whitefish ,  Red Lodge ,  Big Sky , and  West Yellowstone , have a small sales tax (0.25%).

[ edit ]   New Hampshire   New Hampshire  is one of only five states that do not impose any form of general sales tax on the sale or use of tangible personal property within the state. New Hampshire does, however, levy a tax on meals, room occupancies, motor vehicle rentals, and use of electricity (55 cents per megawatt-hour) and phone services (7 percent). A transfer tax is levied on real estate sales, currently 0.15 percent.   In New Hampshire, any food or beverage that is prepared and served by a ""restaurant,"" whether served for consumption on or off the restaurant premises, is considered to be a meal.

In addition, local sales taxes are imposed on sales of certain items sold in Atlantic City and Cape May County. For additional information, see Tax Topic Bulletin S&U-4, New Jersey Sales Tax Guide, available at:  http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/pubs/sales/su4.pdf   A full list of Urban Enterprise Zones is available on the State of New Jersey Web site.

[ edit ]   New Mexico   The state of  New Mexico  does not have a sales tax. It instead has a statewide  gross receipts tax  of 5%, with municipalities assessing an additional gross receipts tax. The gross receipts tax rate is between 5.125% and 8.4375% throughout the state  [ 59 ]  . In New Mexico's gross receipts tax, all receipts from sales of goods or service within the state are taxed (with the exception of food for offsite consumption, such as grocery store sales).   The state does not prohibit retailers from collecting this tax directly from the consumer, so the gross receipts tax is commonly just passed on from the retailer to the consumer as if it were a sales tax.     [ edit ]   New York   New York  has a 4% state sales tax. All counties and some cities add local taxes ranging from 3% to 4.75%. The combined sales tax in  Utica, New York , for example, is 8.75%.

There is no New York City sales tax imposed on the purchase of clothing and footwear regardless of the amount. As of September 1, 2007, New York State has eliminated sales tax on all clothing and shoes if the single item is priced under $110. Most counties and cities have not eliminated their local sales taxes on clothing and shoes. There are however, 11 counties and 5 cities (most notably New York City, New York, Queens, Kings, Richmond, and Bronx, which make up New York City are not counted)) that have done so. The counties where the year-round exemption will apply include: Chautauqua, Chenango, Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, Hamilton, Madison (outside the City of Oneida), Rensselaer, Tioga, Broome, and Wayne. The cities where the year-round exemption will apply include: Gloversville, New York City, Norwich, Olean, Binghamton, and Sherrill. New York also exempts college textbooks from sales tax.

Most non-prepared food purchases are taxed at a reduced rate of 2%. Candy, soft drinks, and prepared foods are taxed at the full combined 7% rate, with some counties levying an additional 1% tax on prepared foods.

[ edit ]   Oklahoma   Oklahoma  has a 4.5% sales tax rate. Cities have an additional sales tax which varies, but is generally 3-4% resulting in a total sales tax rate of 7.5% to 8.5%.     [ edit ]   Oregon   Oregon  has no statewide sales tax, although local municipalities may impose sales taxes if they so choose. The city of  Ashland , for example, charges a 5% sales tax on prepared food. Several Oregon communities assess sales taxes on lodging.     [ edit ]   Pennsylvania   Pennsylvania  has a 6% sales tax rate.  Allegheny County  and  Philadelphia County  have an additional 1% sales tax.

Some items that are exempt from commonwealth sales tax, specifically unprocessed foods, may still be subject to the city sales tax in the municipalities.  [ 65 ]     [ edit ]   Rhode Island   Rhode Island  has a state sales tax of 7%. The rate was raised from 1% to 6% as a temporary measure in the 1970s, but has not since been lowered.   Rhode Island raised its sales tax from 6% to 7% in the early 1990s to pay for the bailout of the state's failed credit unions. The change was initially proposed as a temporary measure, but was later made permanent.   Other taxes may also apply, such as the state's 1% restaurant tax.   Many items are exempt from the state sales tax, e.g., food, prescription drugs, clothing and footwear, newspapers, coffins, and original artwork. [ 66 ]     [ edit ]   South Carolina   South Carolina  has a 6% state sales tax, as of  June 1 ,  2007  (7% for accommodations), but counties and some cities may impose an additional 1% or 2% sales tax.

[ edit ]   South Dakota   South Dakota  has a 4% state sales tax, plus any additional local taxes. An additional 1% sales tax is added during the summer season on sales occurring in tourism-related businesses and dedicated to the state's office of tourism.     [ edit ]   Tennessee   Tennessee  charges 5.5% sales tax on groceries as of  January 1 ,  2008 , and 7% on other items. Counties also tax up to 2.75% in increments of 0.25%  most do so around 2.25%. If a county does not charge the maximum, its cities can charge and keep all or part of the  remainder . Several cities are in more than one county, but none charge a city tax, thus paying only the county taxes. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]     [ edit ]   Texas   The  Texas  state sales and use tax rate is 6.25%, but local taxing jurisdictions (cities, counties, special purpose districts, and transit authorities) may also impose sales and use taxes up to 2% for a total of 8.25%. [ 69 ]  Medicine, produce, eggs, meats, bakery products, and others are exempt from tax. [ 70 ]  In May 2006, Texas imposed a 1% tax on the  gross receipts  of businesses (retailers pay a .5 percent rate), but exempts sole proprietorships and general partnerships.

[ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Utah   Utah  has a 4.75% state sales tax. Additionally, local taxing authorities can impose their own sales tax. Currently the majority of Utah's aggregate sales taxes are in the range of 5.5% - 7.0%. [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Vermont   Vermont  has a 6% sales tax. [ 74 ]     [ edit ]   Virginia   Virginia  has a general sales tax rate of 5% (4% state tax and 1% local tax). Consumers are taxed on every 'eligible food item.' For example, fresh local  produce  sold at farmers markets and grocery stores, or basic, unprepared cold  grocery  foods, are taxed 2.5% (1.5% state tax and 1% local tax). [ 75 ]  Cities and counties may also charge an additional ""Food and Beverage Tax"" on restaurant meals. [ 76 ]   Virginia's use tax also applies at the same rate for out of state purchases (food 2.5%, non-food 5%)exceeding $100 per year. [ 77 ]  Various exemptions include prescription and non-prescription medicine [ 78 ] , gasoline [need citation, but was told not to report gas purchases], and postage stamps, or the labor portion of vehicle repair (parts portion only, citation needed). ""Cost price"" does not include separately stated shipping or delivery charges but it does include a ""shipping and handling"" charge if listed as a combined item on the sales invoice. [ 79 ]  However, unlike Maryland and West Virginia consumer use tax forms, the Virginia CU-7 Consumer Use Tax Form does not recognize that it is possible to be  under-taxed  in another state and so only addresses  untaxed  items only. Unlike Maryland's quarterly filing, Virginia's CU-7 is due annually between  January 1  and  May 1  or can be filed optionally instead with Schedule ADJ with Form 760, or Schedule NPY with Form 760PY. As with all states, Virginia has penalties and interest for non-filing, but Virginia's use tax is no more practically enforceable than that of any other state.     [ edit ]   Washington   Washington  has a 6.5% statewide sales tax. As of  October 31 ,  2007 , sales tax is not applied on most food items and prescription medications (not including over-the-counter medications). Individual counties, municipalities and regional transit authorities are entitled to collect a sales tax, which vary from 0.5% to 2.5%. Within King County, the King County Food & Beverage (KCF&B) tax adds an additional .5% to food and beverages purchased in bars, taverns and restaurants resulting in an effective tax rate of 9.5% (9.0% on all other items). [ 80 ]  Additionally, the sale or lease of motor vehicles for use on the road incur an additional 0.3% tax, rental of a car for less than 30 days has an additional state/local tax of 8.9%. [ 80 ]  When renting a car for less than 30 days in Seattle, the total sales tax is 18.6%. When purchasing an automobile, if you trade in a car, the state subtracts the price of the trade when calculating the sales tax to be paid on the automobile (e.g., purchasing a $40,000 car and trading a $20,000 car, you would be taxed on the difference of $20,000 only, not the full amount of the new vehicle).   When staying at hotel (60+ rooms capacity) in Seattle, the sales tax is 15.6%. Residents of Canada and US states or possessions (only US and Canadian locations having a sales tax of less than 3%, e.g., Oregon, Alaska & Alberta) are exempt from sales tax on purchases of tangible  personal property  for use outside the state. Stores at the border will inquire about residency and exempt qualified purchasers from the tax. [ 81 ]  Washington also has a  Gross receipts tax  called the Business and Occupations Tax (B&O).   Also, the seller of a house pays excise taxes on the full sale price. The amount of the varies by county. In King and Snohomish counties, it is up to 1.78%. For example, selling a house for $500K will cost you $8900 in taxes.   Residents of Washington are also obligated to pay a sales and use tax, which is incurred when a resident makes a purchase in another state and uses it within state lines, regardless of whether or not sales tax was paid in another state. This tax is based on an honor system for its residents and is seldom, if ever, paid.   The lowest combined sales tax (statewide and municipality) in Washington is 7.0% in most of Klickitat and Skamania Counties, while the highest combined sales tax in Washington is the aforementioned 9.5% tax on prepared food and beverages in King County.   April 1, 2008 saw tax increases in King County (+.001), Kittitas County (+.003), Mason County (+.001), and the city of Union Gap (+.002) [ 82 ] .   On July 1, 2008, Washington stopped charging an origin-based sales tax, and started charging a destination-based sales tax. This change only applies to transactions beginning and ending within state lines and does not apply to other states. [ 80 ]  Additionally, Washington started collecting taxes from online retailers that have voluntarily agreed to start collecting the sales tax in return for not being sued for back taxes. [ 83 ]   The city of Seattle charges a 7.5% tax on charges for parking garages to go toward mass transit.   On November 4, 2008, voters in King County (Seattle) approved a 0.5% increase in the sales tax. Taxes within the city will increase to 9.5% on retail purchases. This increase was supposed to be effective Jan. 1, 2009 but has been pushed back until April. For the first quarter of 2009 the tax rate in Seattle is 9%.     [ edit ]   West Virginia   West Virginia  has the distinction of being the first US state to enact a sales tax. [ 1 ]  It currently stands at 6%. The sales tax on food currently stands at 3%. Effective  January 1 ,  2006 , the sales tax on food was lowered to 5%, and on  July 1 ,  2007 , it was lowered further to 4%. The sales tax on food was again lowered to 3% on  July 1 ,  2008 . [ 84 ]  However, the reduced rate of tax does not apply to sales, purchases and uses by consumers of prepared food. Prescription drugs are not subject to sales tax. Credit is allowed for sales or use taxes paid to another state with respect to the purchase.   An individual who titles a motor vehicle with the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles must pay a $5.00 title fee and a 5 percent title privilege tax (rather than the 6 percent sales tax). For vehicles purchased new by West Virginia residents, the measure of this tax is the net sales price of the vehicle. For used vehicles, and for vehicles previously titled in other states, the tax is measured by the  National Automobile Dealers Association  book value of the vehicle at the time of registration. No credit is issued for any taxes paid to another state. Trailers, motorboats, all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles are also subject to this tax. [ 85 ]  As of June 7, 2007, new residents of West Virginia no longer have to pay the 5 percent title privilege tax on vehicles, as long as the vehicles were validly titled to the same owner outside the state. [ 86 ]     [ edit ]   Wisconsin   Wisconsin  has a 5% state sales tax, with most of the 72 counties charging an extra 0.5% ""County Tax"".

Brown County  ( Green Bay ) has a 0.5% tax for purchases over $10 which funds the reconstruction of  Lambeau Field . Prescriptions, most non-prepared foods (including meat and dairy), and newspapers are exempt; however over-the-counter medications are not.

For the last 50 years, plastic has been used in a plethora of products, from toys to household goods and much more.     But while plastics are quite widely used, they have indeed come under fire for containing dangerous toxins that can be released in certain circumstances, endangering those who encounter the product. One of those toxins is asbestos.     Asbestos was used in plastics for the same reasons it was used in other compounds - the mineral has long been known for its fire-and heat-resistant qualities and its durability. That means its inclusion in certain plastic products was thought to make products safer and more long-lasting. Asbestos could be found in such plastics as PVC, nylon, and polypropylene.     People use plastic products all the time and rarely develop asbestos-related diseases. However, those who once manufactured plastics containing asbestos are the prime candidates for illnesses such as asbestosis and mesothelioma because they worked daily with the toxic mineral during the process of molding plastic into a variety of products. During their work, they often encountered friable asbestos materials and the airborne fibers released by the asbestos were easily inhaled.     During the decades before asbestos warnings were issued in the late 1970s, it was normal for factory employees to work with the hazardous mineral without benefit of protective clothing of any sort, including respirators, which could have filtered out the dust and prevented inhalation. In many cases, asbestos plastic workers were not warned about the dangers of working with the material, so they did not complain about the fact that no masks were offered.    Interestingly, in the last decade or so, evidence has surfaced that proves asbestos manufacturers knew about the dangers of working with asbestos but did not share this important information with employees. As a matter of fact, there were times when company doctors told executives that asbestos was wreaking havoc on the health of its workers, but any memos of that sort were silenced or destroyed. The result has been hundreds of cases of asbestos-related diseases that could have been avoided had the truth been revealed.    Instead, many who worked with asbestos-contaminated plastics have died of diseases like mesothelioma and others continue to be diagnosed with this aggressive cancer. Mesothelioma attacks the lining of the lungs, abdomen, or heart and is one of the hardest kinds of cancer to fight. Despite advances in treatments for the disease, patients still have relatively short life spans after diagnosis and often succumb to the disease less than a year after diagnosis.    Symptoms of the disease are debilitating and severely compromise quality of life. Breathing is difficult and painful, chest pain is ever-present, and it's nearly impossible for the victim of malignant mesothelioma to lead a normal life. Often, the patient must quit his or her job and turn daily responsibilities over to another family member. That results in depression, anxiety, and other trauma that also affects how a person feels and how long they live.    Many individuals, including those who worked with asbestos-containing plastics, sometimes blame themselves for their disease. However, blame does not usually fall with the victim, especially if their employer knew about the dangers of asbestos but didn't share the knowledge. In that case, monetary compensation may be available to the victim. A good mesothelioma attorney can help those stricken with the disease determine the legal options concerning compensation, which can aid in the payment of medical bills and other expenses associated with the disease.

A  sales tax  is a tax on  consumption , which is displayed as a  percentage  of the sale price. Sales taxes are assessed by every  state  except Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon. Hawaii has a similar  tax  although it is charged to businesses instead of consumers. In some cases, sales taxes are also assessed at the  county  or  municipal  level.   The sales tax is the responsibility of the merchant to collect and remand to the state, and stated separately (or implicitly added at the time of sale) to consumers. Usually only consumers are charged the tax; resellers are exempt if they do not make use of the goods. In some jurisdictions, a reseller's certificate is required to make use of this privilege. This is in contrast to a  Value Added Tax  (VAT), where resellers are also taxed (resellers may then claim the VAT paid on their purchases from the applicable authority). States which have exemptions for specific types of organizations (such as schools), may also require a certificate. A  sales tax audit  is the examination of a companys financial documents by the states tax agency to verify if they have collected the correct amount of sales tax from their customers.   The  Constitution of the United States  limits the power of the states to subjects within their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction over interstate commerce is reserved to the federal government. Nevertheless, a  resident  of a state with a sales tax who purchases goods from a place with no sales tax (or at a lower rate) might be subject to pay a "" use tax "" (often at the same rate as the state sales tax) for non-exempt purchases  (see also  tax-free shopping ) . While there is no  national sales tax  in the United States, the  Fair Tax Act , which would replace  federal income taxes  with a sales tax and monthly rebate, has attracted interest in the  United States Congress  and the  2008 presidential campaign .

Georgia passed legislation enacting a sales tax in 1929. 11 other states enacted sales taxes in 1933 alone. By 1940, at least 30 states had a sales tax. [ 1 ]  Currently, 45 of the 50 U.S. States levy a sales and use tax against purchases.  [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   States and federal districts     [ edit ]   Alabama   Alabama  has a state general sales tax of 4%, plus any additional local taxes which can amount to a combined total sales tax of up to 10% in some cities such as Montgomery. Alabama is one of several states that do not exempt food from state taxes. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Alaska   There is no state sales tax in  Alaska ; however, local governments (boroughs and their municipalities) may levy up to 7%, and 108 of them do so. [ 4 ]  Municipal sales taxes are collected in addition to borough sales taxes, if any. Regulations and exemptions vary widely across the state. [ 5 ]   Anchorage  and  Fairbanks  do not charge a local sales tax.     [ edit ]   Arizona   Arizona  has a  transaction privilege tax (TPT)  that differs from a ""true"" sales tax in that the tax is levied on the gross receipts of the vendor and is not a liability of the consumer. [ 6 ]  (As explained in Arizona Administrative Code rule R15-5-2202, [ 7 ]  vendors are permitted to pass the amount of the tax on to the consumer, but remain the liable parties for the tax to the state.) TPT is imposed under sixteen tax classifications (as of November 1, 2006), [ 8 ]  with the tax rate most commonly encountered by Arizona consumers (e.g., for retail transactions) set at 5.6%. The current tax as of 2009 is 6.1%, [ 9 ]  though cities and counties can add as much as 6% to the total rate. [ 10 ]  Food for home consumption and prescription drugs (including  legend drugs  and certain prescribed  homeopathic medication ) are two of many items of tangible personal property that are statutorily exempt from the retail TPT. Arizona's TPT is one of the few excise taxes in the country imposed on contracting activities rather than sales of construction materials. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Arkansas   Arkansas  has a state sales tax of 6%, plus any additional local taxes.   Effective  July 1 ,  2007 , Arkansas state sales tax on unprepared food (groceries) reduced to 3%. Local sales taxes on groceries remained unchanged.     [ edit ]   California   California  has a statewide sales tax of 7.25%, and local supplementary taxes are allowed up to 9.25%. Sales and use taxes in the state of California are collected by the publicly elected tax commission in the United States. The statewide 7.25% is allocated as: [ 12 ]     7.25% - State    5.00% - State - General Fund   0.25% - State - Fiscal Recovery Fund   0.50% - State - Local Revenue Fund   0.50% - State - Local Public Safety Fund   1.00% -  Uniform Local Tax     0.25% - Local County - Transportation funds   0.75% - Local City/County - Operational funds             On April 1, 2009 the state sales and use tax will increase by 1% as a result of the  2008-2009 California budget crisis . The minimum sales tax statewide will be 8.25%. [ 13 ] [ 14 ]   Supplementary sales tax may be added (with voter approval) by cities, counties, service authorities, and various special districts (such as the  Bay Area Rapid Transit  district). The effect is that sales tax rates vary from 7.25% (in areas where no additional taxes are charged) to 8.75% (for example, in the city of  Avalon , on  Santa Catalina Island , in  National City , and in  Alameda County ). On Oct. 1, 2008, the city of  South Gate  increased their sales-tax rate to 9.25%, the highest in California. [ 15 ]   The last changes to the published local tax rates took effect on  April 1 ,  2007 . Official updates are published on the Board of Equalization website and also in Publication 71. [ 16 ] [ 17 ]   In general, sales tax is required on all purchases of tangible personal property to its ultimate consumer. Services are not subject to sales tax (but may be subject to other taxes).   Vehicle purchases are taxed based on the city and county in which the purchaser registers the vehicle, and not on the county in which the vehicle is purchased. There is therefore no advantage in purchasing a car in a cheaper county to save on sales tax (a one-percent difference in sales tax rate would otherwise result in an additional $300 loss on a $30,000 car).   In grocery stores, unprepared food items are not taxed but vitamins and all other items are. Ready-to-eat hot foods, whether sold by supermarkets or other vendors, are taxed. Restaurant bills are taxed. As an exception, hot beverages and bakery items are tax-exempt if and only if they are for take-out and are not sold with any other hot food. If consumed on the seller's premises, such items are taxed like restaurant meals. All other food is exempt from sales tax.   Also excluded are food animals (livestock), food plants and seeds, fertilizer used to grow food, prescription drugs and certain medical supplies, energy utilities, certain alternative energy devices and supplies, art for display by public agencies, and veterans' pins. There are many specific exemptions for various veterans', non-profit, educational, religious, and youth organizations. Sale of items to certain out-of-state or national entities (mostly transportation companies) is exempt, as are some goods sold while in transit through California to a foreign destination.   Occasional or one-time sales not part of a regular business are exempt, except that sales of three or more non-food animals (puppies, kittens, etc.) per year are taxed.  [ 18 ]   There are also exemptions for numerous specific products, from telephone lines and poles, to liquid petroleum gas for farm machinery, to coins, to public transit vehicles. There are  partial  exemptions for such varied items as racehorse breeding stock, teleproduction service equipment, farm machinery, and timber-harvesting equipment. [ 19 ]  For an organized list of exemptions, with estimates for how much revenue the state loses and the people saves for each, see Publication 61 of the Board of Equalization. [ 20 ]   Sales tax is charged on gasoline. The tax is levied on both the gasoline and on the federal and state excise taxes, resulting in double taxation. The sales tax is included in the metered price at the pump. The California excise tax on gasoline is 18 cents a gallon. [ 21 ]   Motor vehicle gasoline and jet fuel are subject to special taxation regimes. In 2005, there was a political dispute in the San Francisco Bay Area about whether revenues for jet fuel should be credited to  San Mateo County  (where  San Francisco International Airport  is physically located), the City and County of  San Francisco , which owns the airport, or  Alameda County , where  Oakland International Airport  is located. (The distinction is largely point of delivery vs. point of negotiation for the sale.) This is controlled by Regulation 1802, [ 22 ]  which has other provisions about businesses which have multiple locations.   Critics of the current sales tax regime charge that it gives local governments an incentive to promote commercial development (through zoning and other regulations) over residential development, including the use of eminent domain condemnation proceedings to transfer real estate to higher sales tax generating businesses. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Colorado   Colorado 's state sales tax is 2.9% with some cities and counties levying additional taxes.  Denver 's tangibles tax is 3.62%, with food eaten away from the home being taxed at 4%. There is also a football stadium tax, mass transit tax, and scientific and cultural facilities tax. Most transactions in Denver and the surrounding area are taxed at a total of about 8%. Colorado does not charge sales tax on unprepared food (groceries).     [ edit ]   Connecticut   Connecticut  has a 6% sales tax, with no additional local taxes. Most non-prepared food products are exempt, as are most prescription and nonprescription medications, all internet services, all magazine and newspaper subscriptions, and textbooks (for college students only). Most clothing costing less than $50 per item is also exempt; items costing more than $50 are charged sales tax on the entire price. [ 24 ]   Shipping and delivery charges (including charges for U.S. postage) made by a retailer to a customer are subject to sales and use taxes when provided in connection with the sales of taxable tangible personal property or services. The tax applies even if the charges are separately stated and applies regardless of whether the shipping or delivery is provided by the seller or by a third party. No tax is due on shipping and delivery charges in connection with any sale that is not subject to sales or use tax. Shipping or delivery charges related to sales for resale or sales of exempt items are not taxable. Likewise, charges for mailing or delivery services are not subject to tax if they are made in connection with the sale of nontaxable services. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Delaware   Delaware does not assess a sales tax on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096 percent to 1.92 percent, depending upon the category of business activity.     [ edit ]   District of Columbia   Washington, D.C.  has a sales tax rate of 5.75%. The tax is imposed on sale of tangible personal property and selected services. A 9% tax is imposed on liquor sold for off premises consumption, 10% on restaurant meals and rental cars, 12% on parking, and 14% on hotel accommodations. Groceries, prescription and non-prescription drugs, and residential utilities services are exempt from the District's sales tax.  [ 26 ]   The District has two sales tax holidays each year, one during ""back-to-school"" and one preceding the holiday shopping season. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Florida   Florida  has a general sales tax rate of 6%. [ 28 ]  The tax is imposed on the sale or rental of goods, the sale of admissions, the lease, license, or rental of real property, the lease or rental of transient living accommodations, and the sale of a limited number of services such as commercial pest control, commercial cleaning, and certain protection services. There are a variety of exemptions from the tax, including groceries and prescriptions. [ 29 ]   A ""discretionary sales surtax"" may be imposed by the counties of up to 1.5%, charged at the rate of the destination county (if shipped). This is 1% in most counties, 0.5% in many, 1.5% in very few, and 0.25% in one county. A few have none at all. Most have an  expiration date , but a few do not. Only the first $5,000 of a large purchase is subject to the surtax rate. [ 30 ]  Most counties levy the surtax for education or transportation improvements.   There are annual sales tax holidays, such as a back-to-school holiday on clothing, books, and school supplies under a certain price, as well as a new one in June 2007 to promote  hurricane preparedness . The 2008 Legislators did not enact any sales tax holidays.   Florida also permits counties to raise a ""tourist development tax"" of up to an additional 6% on hotel rooms.     [ edit ]   Georgia   Georgia  has a 4% state sales tax rate. Groceries are exempt from the state sales tax, but still subject to tax by the local sales tax rate. Counties may impose local sales tax of 1%, 2%, or 3%, consisting of up to three 1% local-option sales taxes (out of a set of five) as permitted by Georgia law. These include a  SPLOST , a  homestead exemption  (HOST), and one for  public schools  which can be put forth for a  referendum  by the  school board  instead of the  county commission  (in cooperation with its  city councils ). Also, the city of  Atlanta  imposes an additional 1% municipal-option sales tax (MOST), as allowed by  special legislation  of the  Georgia General Assembly , solely for the purpose of fixing its  water  and  sewerage  systems.   As of July 2008, total sales tax rates in Georgia are 3% for groceries and 7% for other items in the vast majority of  its 159 counties . A few counties charge only 2% local tax (6% total on non-grocery items), and four partially exempt groceries from the local tax by charging 2% on food, and 3% (7% total) on other items. Fulton and DeKalb counties charge 1% for  MARTA , and adjacent  metro Atlanta  counties may do so by referendum if they so choose. For the portions of Fulton and DeKalb within the city of Atlanta, the total is at 8% (4% on groceries) due to the MOST. [ 31 ]   Similar to Florida and certain other states, Georgia has two sales tax holidays per year. One is for  back-to-school  sales the first weekend in August, but sometimes starting at the end of July. A second usually occurs in October, for  energy-efficient   appliances  with the  Energy Star   certification .   Georgia has many exemptions available to specific businesses and industries. To identify potential exemptions, businesses and consumers must research the laws and rules for sales and use tax and review current exemption forms.  [ 32 ]     [ edit ]   Hawaii   Hawaii  does not have a sales tax, but it does have an  excise tax  which applies to nearly every conceivable type of  transaction  (including  services ), and is technically charged to the  business  rather than the  consumer . Unlike other states, businesses may or may not show the tax separately on the  receipt , as it is technically part of the selling price. 4.0% is charged at  retail  with an additional 0.5% surcharge in the  City and County of Honolulu  (for a total of 4.5% on Oahu sales), and 0.5% is charged on  wholesale   [7] . However the state also allows ""tax on tax"" to be charged, which effectively means a customer is billed 4.166% (4.712% on Oahu). The exact dollar or percentage amount to be added must be quoted to customers within or along with the price. The 0.5% surcharge on Oahu was implemented to fund the new rail transport system.  [ 33 ]  The use of an excise tax means that  tax-exempt   non-profit organizations  must pay the tax, unlike states where they are exempt from sales taxes.     [ edit ]   Idaho   Idaho  has a 6.0% state sales tax. Some localities levy an additional local sales tax. [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   Illinois   Illinois'  sales and use tax scheme includes four major divisions. Retailers' Occupation Tax, Use Tax, Service Occupation Tax and the Service Use Tax. Each of these taxes is administered by the Illinois Department of Revenue. The Retailers' Occupation Tax is imposed upon persons engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property to purchasers for use or consumption. It is measured by the gross receipts of the retailer. The base rate of 6.25% is broken down as follows: 5% State, 1% City, 0.25% County. Local governments may impose additional tax resulting in a combined rate that ranges from the State minimum of 6.25% to a current high of 11.50% in certain business districts in Cook County. [ 35 ] . A complementary Use Tax is imposed upon the privilege of using or consuming property purchased anywhere at retail from a retailer. Illinois registered retailers are authorized to collect the Use Tax from their customers and use it to offset their obligations under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. Since the Use Tax rate is equivalent to the corresponding Retailers' Occupation Tax rate, the amount collected by the retailer matches the amount the retailer must submit to the Illinois Department of Revenue. The combination of these two taxes is what is commonly referred to as ""sales tax"". If the purchaser does not pay the Use Tax directly to a retailer (for instance, on an item purchased from an Internet seller), they must remit it directly to the Illinois Department of Revenue. [ 36 ]   The Service Occupation Tax is imposed upon the privilege of engaging in service businesses and is measured by the selling price of tangible personal property transferred as an incident to providing a service. The Service Use Tax is imposed upon the privilege of using or consuming tangible personal property transferred as an incident to the provision of a service. An example would be a printer of business cards. The printer owes Service Occupation Tax on the value of the paper and ink transferred to the customer in the form of printed business cards. The serviceperson may satisfy this tax by paying Use Tax to his supplier of paper and ink or, alternatively, may charge Service Use Tax to the purchaser of the business cards and remit the amount collected as Service Occupation Tax on the serviceperson's tax return. The service itself, however, is not subject to tax.   Qualifying food, drugs, medicines and medical appliances [ 37 ]  have sales tax of 1% plus local home rule tax depending on the location where purchased. Newspapers and magazines are exempt from sales tax as are legal tender, currency, medallions, bullion or gold or silver coinage issued by the State of Illinois, the government of the United States of America, or the government of any foreign country.   Illinois' system is exceptionally complicated. A brief overview is detailed on the Illinois Department of Revenue website. [ 38 ]   The city of Chicago has the highest total sales tax of all major U.S. cities. [ 39 ]  It is also one of the most complex. 10.25% is levied on all non-perishable goods purchased, while 2% is levied on qualifying food, drugs, medicines and medical appliances. [ 39 ]  The Illinois Department of Revenue collects a 3% Chicago Soft Drink Tax and a 1%  Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority  (MPEA) ""Food and Beverage Tax"", on prepared food and beverage purchases in the downtown area (These ""downtown"" boundaries are: Surf Street on the north, Ashland Avenue on the west, Stevenson Expressway (I-55) on the south, & Lake Michigan on the east. Furthermore, O'Hare and Midway airports also fall under the 1% MPEA tax district). [ 40 ]  In addition, the Chicago Department of Revenue collects additional sales taxes on items such as fountain drinks, bottled water, liquor, and cigarettes. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Indiana   Indiana  has a 7% state sales tax. The tax rate was raised from 6% on  April 1 ,  2008 , to offset the loss of revenue from the statewide property tax reform, which is expected to significantly lower property taxes. Untaxed retail items include medications, water, ice and unprepared, raw staple foods or fruit juices. Many localities, inclusive of either counties or cities, in the state of Indiana also have a sales tax on restaurant food and beverages consumed in the restaurant or purchased to go. Revenues are usually used for economic development and tourism projects. This additional tax rate may be 1% or 2% or other amounts depending on the county in which the business is located. For example, in  Marion County, Indiana , the sales tax for restaurants is 9%.     [ edit ]   Iowa   As of July 1, 2008,  Iowa  has a 6% state sales tax. Most counties impose local option sales taxes of up to 1% each, bringing the total up to 7%. There is no tax on most unprepared food, excluding corn. The Iowa Department of Revenue provides information about local option sales taxes, [ 42 ]  including sales tax rate lookup.     [ edit ]   Kansas   Kansas  has a 5.3% state sales tax. More than 700 jurisdictions within the state (cities, counties, and special districts) may impose additional taxes. For example, in the capital city of  Topeka , retailers must collect 5.3% for the state, 1.15% for  Shawnee County , and 1% for the city, for a total rate of 7.45%. As of February 2007, the highest rate was 8.65%, in the  Roeland Park  Transportation District.     [ edit ]   Kentucky   Kentucky  has a 6% state sales tax. Alcohol (until April 1, 2009) and most staple grocery foods are exempt.     [ edit ]   Louisiana   Louisiana  has a 4% state sales tax: 3.97% to sales tax and .03% to Louisiana tourism district. [ 43 ]  There are also taxes on the  parish  (county) level and some on the city levels. [ 44 ]  Parishes may add local taxes up to 5%, while local jurisdictions within parishes may add more. Louisiana also bids out sales tax audits to private companies, with many being paid on a percentage collected basis.   Orleans Parish collects the maximum 5% tax rate for a total of 9% on general purpose items. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Maine   Maine  has a 5% general, service provider and use tax. [ 46 ]  The tax on lodging and prepared food is 7% and short term auto rental is 10%. These are all generally known as ""sales tax"".     [ edit ]   Maryland   Maryland  has a 6% state sales and use tax as of  January 3 ,  2008  (it was 5% before this), with exceptions for medicine, residential energy, and most non-prepared foods. Currently, many services (e.g., auto repair labor, haircuts, accounting) are not taxed. With this tax increase, Maryland added sales tax on Internet purchases and other mail items such as magazine subscriptions. Clothing is also taxable.   Certain computer services were to be subject to sales tax and use tax effective July 1, 2008 after being approved without public hearing during the 2007 Special Legislative Session. [ 47 ]  However, after effective lobbying by computer services professionals, the tax was repealed April 6th during the final days of the General Assembly. Following declining approval ratings and intense public pressure, Governor  Martin O'Malley  relented and authorized the repeal.     [ edit ]   Massachusetts   Massachusetts  has a 5% sales tax, replete with numerous exceptions including (among other things): ""food products"" (but excluding prepared meals); residential water, gas, electric services; returnable containers, clothing and footwear up to $175 (for clothing over $175, tax is due only on the amount over $175 per item [ 48 ] ); prescription medicines, prostheses and medical appliances or services; publications for use in education or religious worship; poultry and livestock, as well as their feed; fruit and vegetable stock for generating food for humans; tools, machinery, parts, etc., for use in agriculture; cloth or other materials used for making clothing; residential heat pump, solar or wind power system; items purchasable with federal food stamps; the American Flag; etc. An enacted change in 2006 taxes computer software that is downloaded for use in Massachusetts, whereas previously this was viewed as a non-taxable ""service"". [ 49 ]   Every year since 2004, the State Government has enacted tax holidays suspending the sales tax on purchases for one weekend in August. Motor vehicles, motorboats, meals, telecommunications services, gas, steam, electricity, tobacco products, and any single item with a price exceeding $2,500 were excluded from the holiday. [ 50 ]     [ edit ]   Michigan   Michigan  has a 6% sales tax. Michigan has a use tax of 6%, which is a tax that is applied to items brought into Michigan but not bought there, and on rentals in some situations, and is supposed to be paid when filing income tax. [ 51 ]  A service tax was approved in September 2007, effective December 1st, 2007, allowing certain services to be taxed. The services tax was repealed the same day it went into effect. There is no local sales tax in Michigan. Food, periodicals [ 52 ] , and prescription drugs are not taxed. Restaurants, however, do have a tax, but the tax is for the service and not on the food. Michigan also has recently introduced a business tax called the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) which replaces the Single Business Tax (SBT). [ 53 ]     [ edit ]   Minnesota   Minnesota  currently has a 6.5% state sales tax. A statewide referendum passed on Nov. 4, 2008 which will add 3/8 of 1 percent, bringing the total to 6.875%. The new rate will go into effect on July 1, 2009. [ 54 ]  As of  July 1 ,  2008 , an additional 0.25%  Transit Improvement tax  was phased in across five counties in the  Minneapolis-St. Paul  metropolitan area for transit development. These counties include  Hennepin ,  Ramsey ,  Anoka ,  Dakota ,  Washington . The Transit Improvement tax brings taxes in these counties to 7.125%. Saint Paul imposes an additional 0.5% tax, bringing the total to 7.625%. An additional 0.15% is imposed in  Hennepin County  to finance a new  Minnesota Twins  stadium, in addition to 0.5% imposed in Minneapolis, bringing the total rate in the city of Minneapolis to 7.775% and 7.275% in the rest of Hennepin County. Food (not including prepared food, some beverages such as soda pop, and other items such as candy) and clothing are exempt from the sales tax. Prescription drugs are also exempt. [ 55 ]  Municipalities may be allowed by the state legislature to institute local option taxes. Rochester imposes a 0.5% for a total of 7.375% sales tax. Current local option taxes include a ""lodging"" tax in Duluth (3%), Minneapolis (3%), and Rochester (4%), as well as served ""food and beverage"" tax in Duluth (2.25%). An additional 1% sales tax is imposed in Duluth, bringing the total to 7.875%. Alcohol has a 9% sales tax statewide (6.5% sales tax, plus 2.5% gross receipts tax) not including any applicable local taxes. In addition to the local 1% sales tax added to Duluth sales, Duluth imposes an additional 2.25% tax on all food, beverage and alcohol sales at restaurants.     [ edit ]   Mississippi   Mississippi  has a 7% state sales tax. Cities and towns may implement an additional tourism tax on restaurant and hotel sales. The city of Tupelo has a 0.25% tax in addition to other taxes. Restaurant and fast food tax is 9%. The city of Hattiesburg also has a 9% sales tax on Restaurant and fast food tax.     [ edit ]   Missouri   Missouri  has a 4.225% state sales & use tax rate. The state sales tax rate on certain foods is 1.225%. Counties, cities, and special taxing districts may impose additional sales & use taxes.   Transportation Development Districts and Museum Districts may impose sales tax (but not use tax) up to 1%, in addition to all other sales taxes. However, the Missouri Department of Revenue does not administer sales tax for these districts, nor does it publish their sales tax rates. As of August 2007, there is no public, comprehensive and complete list of these districts, their locations, and the sales tax rates they impose.     [ edit ]   Montana   Montana  does not have a state sales tax but some municipalities which are big tourist destinations, such as  Whitefish ,  Red Lodge ,  Big Sky , and  West Yellowstone , have a small sales tax (0.25%).     [ edit ]   Nebraska   Nebraska  has a 5.5% state sales tax. Municipalities have the option of imposing an additional sales tax of up to 1.5%. Specific tax rates per counties are available on the web. [ 56 ]     [ edit ]   Nevada   Nevada 's state sales tax rate is 6.5 percent. Counties may impose additional rates via voter approval or through approval of the Legislature; therefore, the applicable sales tax varies by county from 6.5 percent to 7.75 percent (in Clark County), as of  October 1 ,  2007 . Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, imposes four separate county option taxes in addition to the statewide rate - 0.25 percent for flood control, 0.50 percent for mass transit, 0.25 to fund the Southern Nevada Water Authority, and 0.25 percent for the addition of police officers in that county. In Washoe County (which includes Reno), the sales tax rate is 7.375 percent, due to county option rates for flood control, the ReTRAC train trench project, mass transit, and an additional county rate approved under the Local Government Tax Act of 1991. [ 57 ]   For travelers to Las Vegas, note that the lodging tax rate in unincorporated Clark County, which includes the  Las Vegas Strip , is 9%. Within the boundaries of the City of Las Vegas, the lodging tax rate is 11%.     [ edit ]   New Hampshire   New Hampshire  is one of only five states that do not impose any form of general sales tax on the sale or use of tangible personal property within the state. New Hampshire does, however, levy a tax on meals, room occupancies, motor vehicle rentals, and use of electricity (55 cents per megawatt-hour) and phone services (7 percent). A transfer tax is levied on real estate sales, currently 0.15 percent.   In New Hampshire, any food or beverage that is prepared and served by a ""restaurant,"" whether served for consumption on or off the restaurant premises, is considered to be a meal. Excluded from the tax is any food and beverage that is wholly packaged off the premises and sold in the original package, such as chips, candy, soda or fruit beverages in sealed containers, and frozen novelties. Catered or delivered meals or party platters are taxable, as are charges for any service or items related to preparing or serving the food (plates, ovens, etc). Restaurants include most places where you can buy any food. There are several other exceptions. For example, meals served or furnished on the premises of a religious or charitable nonprofit organization are not taxable, nor are bakery products sold in quantity of 6 or more servings, or a whole pie, cake, or loaf of bread with multiple servings.   The New Hampshire meals and rooms tax rate is 8% on any amount over 35 cents (including any alcohol served on premise). The rooms tax is imposed on any occupancy in a hotel, house, apartment, dormitory, camp, cottage or any similar establishment offering sleeping accommodations in the State of New Hampshire, for any rental less than 185 days, not including bare campsites without shelter. The tax rate is currently 8% of the rent for each occupancy. A motor vehicle rental tax is imposed under the meals and room tax classification at a rate of 8% on the gross rental receipts of each rental, but not including separately itemized fuel, insurance or damage charges.   Gasoline tax is 20.6 per gallon. Cigarettes: $1.08 per pack. Beer: 30 per gallon.     See also   tax-free shopping .       [ edit ]   New Jersey   New Jersey  The State of New Jerseys sales and use tax rate is seven percent (7%). However, there are exceptions to this statewide rate. In Urban Enterprise Zones, UEZ-impacted business districts, and in Salem County, sales tax may be charged at 3.5% (50% of the regular rate) on certain items. In addition, local sales taxes are imposed on sales of certain items sold in Atlantic City and Cape May County. For additional information, see Tax Topic Bulletin S&U-4, New Jersey Sales Tax Guide, available at:  http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/pubs/sales/su4.pdf   A full list of Urban Enterprise Zones is available on the State of New Jersey Web site. [ 58 ]   New Jersey does not charge sales tax on unprepared food (except certain sweets and pet food), household paper products, medicine, and clothing. New Jersey does not charge sales tax on goods purchased for resale or on capital improvements but does charge sales tax on certain services. See the NJ Division of Taxation website at:  http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/su.shtml   New Jersey does not charge sales tax on gasoline, but gasoline is subject to a $0.145/gallon  excise tax .   Sales of clothing and accessories that are made of fur from the hide or pelt of an animal that is valued at $500 or more are subject to a 6% Fur Clothing Gross Receipts Tax.     [ edit ]   New Mexico   The state of  New Mexico  does not have a sales tax. It instead has a statewide  gross receipts tax  of 5%, with municipalities assessing an additional gross receipts tax. The gross receipts tax rate is between 5.125% and 8.4375% throughout the state  [ 59 ]  . In New Mexico's gross receipts tax, all receipts from sales of goods or service within the state are taxed (with the exception of food for offsite consumption, such as grocery store sales).   The state does not prohibit retailers from collecting this tax directly from the consumer, so the gross receipts tax is commonly just passed on from the retailer to the consumer as if it were a sales tax.     [ edit ]   New York   New York  has a 4% state sales tax. All counties and some cities add local taxes ranging from 3% to 4.75%. The combined sales tax in  Utica, New York , for example, is 8.75%. In  New York City , total sales tax is 8.375%, which includes 0.375% charged for the service of the  Metropolitan Transportation Authority .   There is no New York City sales tax imposed on the purchase of clothing and footwear regardless of the amount. As of September 1, 2007, New York State has eliminated sales tax on all clothing and shoes if the single item is priced under $110. Most counties and cities have not eliminated their local sales taxes on clothing and shoes. There are however, 11 counties and 5 cities (most notably New York City, New York, Queens, Kings, Richmond, and Bronx, which make up New York City are not counted)) that have done so. The counties where the year-round exemption will apply include: Chautauqua, Chenango, Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, Hamilton, Madison (outside the City of Oneida), Rensselaer, Tioga, Broome, and Wayne. The cities where the year-round exemption will apply include: Gloversville, New York City, Norwich, Olean, Binghamton, and Sherrill. New York also exempts college textbooks from sales tax.   As of  June 1 ,  2008 , when products are purchased online and shipped within New York State, the retailer must charge the tax amount appropriate to the locality where the goods are shipped, and in addition, must also charge the appropriate tax on the cost of shipping and handling.     [ edit ]   North Carolina   North Carolina  has a state-levied sales tax of 4.5%, effective October 1, 2008, with most counties adding an additional 2.5% tax, for a total tax of 7%.  Mecklenburg County  levies an additional 0.5% tax, which is directed towards funding the  light rail system , for a total of 7.5%.   There is a 30.2 tax per gallon on  gas , a 35 tax per pack of cigarettes, a 79 tax per gallon on wine, and a 53 tax per gallon on beer. Most non-prepared food purchases are taxed at a reduced rate of 2%. Candy, soft drinks, and prepared foods are taxed at the full combined 7% rate, with some counties levying an additional 1% tax on prepared foods. In order to benefit back-to-school shoppers, there is a  sales tax holiday  that exempts certain items of tangible personal property sold between the first Friday in August and the following Sunday.     [ edit ]   North Dakota   North Dakota  has a 5% state sales tax for general sales. Sales Tax in North Dakota varies depending on the category. (5%, 7%, 3% and 2%)  [ 60 ]     [ edit ]   Ohio   Ohio  has a 5.5% state sales tax.  [ 61 ]  Counties may levy a permissive sales tax of from 1/4% up to 2.5% and transit authorities, mass transit districts usually centered on one primary county, may levy a sales tax of from 1/4% up to 2.5%. Cuyahoga county has the highest sales tax of 7.75%. Tax increments may not be less than 1/4%, and the total tax rate, including the state rate, may not exceed 8.5%. County permissive taxes may be levied by emergency resolution of the county boards of commissioners. Transit authority taxes must and county permissive taxes may be levied by a vote of the electors of the district or county. Shipping and handling charges are considered part of the retail price and are also taxable. Ohio also has a  gross receipts tax  called the  Commercial Activity Tax (CAT)  that is applicable only to businesses but shares some similarities to a sales tax.     [ edit ]   Oklahoma   Oklahoma  has a 4.5% sales tax rate. Cities have an additional sales tax which varies, but is generally 3-4% resulting in a total sales tax rate of 7.5% to 8.5%.     [ edit ]   Oregon   Oregon  has no statewide sales tax, although local municipalities may impose sales taxes if they so choose. The city of  Ashland , for example, charges a 5% sales tax on prepared food. Several Oregon communities assess sales taxes on lodging.     [ edit ]   Pennsylvania   Pennsylvania  has a 6% sales tax rate.  Allegheny County  and  Philadelphia County  have an additional 1% sales tax.   Food, most clothing, and footwear are among the items most frequently exempted. [ 62 ]  However, taxed food items include  soft drinks  and powdered mixes,  sports drinks , hot beverages, hot prepared foods,  sandwiches , and  salad bar  meals, unless these items are purchased with  food stamps . Additionally, catering and delivery fees are taxed if the food itself is taxed.   Additional exemptions include internet service, [ 63 ]   newspapers ,  textbooks ,  disposable diapers ,  feminine hygiene  products,  toilet paper ,  wet wipes ,  prescription drugs , many  over-the-counter drugs  and supplies,  oral hygiene  items (including  toothbrushes  and  toothpaste ),  contact lenses  and  eyeglasses ,  health club  and  tanning booth  fees, burial items (like  coffins ,  urns , and  headstones ),  personal protective equipment  for production personnel, work  uniforms ,  veterinary  services, pet medications,  fuel  for residential use (including  coal ,  firewood ,  fuel oil ,  natural gas ,  steam , and  electricity ), many  farming  supplies and equipment, and  ice . [ 64 ]     [ edit ]   Puerto Rico   Puerto Rico  has a 5.5%  commonwealth sales tax  that applies to both products and services with few exemptions (including items such as unprocessed foods, prescription medicines and business-to-business services). Additionally, most municipalities have a city sales tax of 1.5% for a total of 7%. Some items that are exempt from commonwealth sales tax, specifically unprocessed foods, may still be subject to the city sales tax in the municipalities.  [ 65 ]     [ edit ]   Rhode Island   Rhode Island  has a state sales tax of 7%. The rate was raised from 1% to 6% as a temporary measure in the 1970s, but has not since been lowered.   Rhode Island raised its sales tax from 6% to 7% in the early 1990s to pay for the bailout of the state's failed credit unions. The change was initially proposed as a temporary measure, but was later made permanent.   Other taxes may also apply, such as the state's 1% restaurant tax.   Many items are exempt from the state sales tax, e.g., food, prescription drugs, clothing and footwear, newspapers, coffins, and original artwork. [ 66 ]     [ edit ]   South Carolina   South Carolina  has a 6% state sales tax, as of  June 1 ,  2007  (7% for accommodations), but counties and some cities may impose an additional 1% or 2% sales tax. As of mid-2005, 35 of 46 counties do so. Restaurants may also charge an extra 1-2% tax on prepared food (fast food or take-out) in some places. The state's sales tax on unprepared food disappeared completely  November 1 ,  2007 . There is a cap of $300 on sales tax for most vehicles.   Additionally, signs posted in many places of business inform that South Carolina residents over the age of 85 are entitled to a 1% reduction in sales tax.     [ edit ]   South Dakota   South Dakota  has a 4% state sales tax, plus any additional local taxes. An additional 1% sales tax is added during the summer season on sales occurring in tourism-related businesses and dedicated to the state's office of tourism.     [ edit ]   Tennessee   Tennessee  charges 5.5% sales tax on groceries as of  January 1 ,  2008 , and 7% on other items. Counties also tax up to 2.75% in increments of 0.25%  most do so around 2.25%. If a county does not charge the maximum, its cities can charge and keep all or part of the  remainder . Several cities are in more than one county, but none charge a city tax, thus paying only the county taxes. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]     [ edit ]   Texas   The  Texas  state sales and use tax rate is 6.25%, but local taxing jurisdictions (cities, counties, special purpose districts, and transit authorities) may also impose sales and use taxes up to 2% for a total of 8.25%. [ 69 ]  Medicine, produce, eggs, meats, bakery products, and others are exempt from tax. [ 70 ]  In May 2006, Texas imposed a 1% tax on the  gross receipts  of businesses (retailers pay a .5 percent rate), but exempts sole proprietorships and general partnerships. [ 71 ]   If merchants file and pay their sales & use tax on time, they may subtract 1/2 percent of the tax collected as a discount, to encourage prompt payment and to compensate the merchant for collecting the tax from consumers for the state.  [ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Utah   Utah  has a 4.75% state sales tax. Additionally, local taxing authorities can impose their own sales tax. Currently the majority of Utah's aggregate sales taxes are in the range of 5.5% - 7.0%. [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Vermont   Vermont  has a 6% sales tax. [ 74 ]     [ edit ]   Virginia   Virginia  has a general sales tax rate of 5% (4% state tax and 1% local tax). Consumers are taxed on every 'eligible food item.' For example, fresh local  produce  sold at farmers markets and grocery stores, or basic, unprepared cold  grocery  foods, are taxed 2.5% (1.5% state tax and 1% local tax). [ 75 ]  Cities and counties may also charge an additional ""Food and Beverage Tax"" on restaurant meals. [ 76 ]   Virginia's use tax also applies at the same rate for out of state purchases (food 2.5%, non-food 5%)exceeding $100 per year. [ 77 ]  Various exemptions include prescription and non-prescription medicine [ 78 ] , gasoline [need citation, but was told not to report gas purchases], and postage stamps, or the labor portion of vehicle repair (parts portion only, citation needed). ""Cost price"" does not include separately stated shipping or delivery charges but it does include a ""shipping and handling"" charge if listed as a combined item on the sales invoice. [ 79 ]  However, unlike Maryland and West Virginia consumer use tax forms, the Virginia CU-7 Consumer Use Tax Form does not recognize that it is possible to be  under-taxed  in another state and so only addresses  untaxed  items only. Unlike Maryland's quarterly filing, Virginia's CU-7 is due annually between  January 1  and  May 1  or can be filed optionally instead with Schedule ADJ with Form 760, or Schedule NPY with Form 760PY. As with all states, Virginia has penalties and interest for non-filing, but Virginia's use tax is no more practically enforceable than that of any other state.     [ edit ]   Washington   Washington  has a 6.5% statewide sales tax. As of  October 31 ,  2007 , sales tax is not applied on most food items and prescription medications (not including over-the-counter medications). Individual counties, municipalities and regional transit authorities are entitled to collect a sales tax, which vary from 0.5% to 2.5%. Within King County, the King County Food & Beverage (KCF&B) tax adds an additional .5% to food and beverages purchased in bars, taverns and restaurants resulting in an effective tax rate of 9.5% (9.0% on all other items). [ 80 ]  Additionally, the sale or lease of motor vehicles for use on the road incur an additional 0.3% tax, rental of a car for less than 30 days has an additional state/local tax of 8.9%. [ 80 ]  When renting a car for less than 30 days in Seattle, the total sales tax is 18.6%. When purchasing an automobile, if you trade in a car, the state subtracts the price of the trade when calculating the sales tax to be paid on the automobile (e.g., purchasing a $40,000 car and trading a $20,000 car, you would be taxed on the difference of $20,000 only, not the full amount of the new vehicle).   When staying at hotel (60+ rooms capacity) in Seattle, the sales tax is 15.6%. Residents of Canada and US states or possessions (only US and Canadian locations having a sales tax of less than 3%, e.g., Oregon, Alaska & Alberta) are exempt from sales tax on purchases of tangible  personal property  for use outside the state. Stores at the border will inquire about residency and exempt qualified purchasers from the tax. [ 81 ]  Washington also has a  Gross receipts tax  called the Business and Occupations Tax (B&O).   Also, the seller of a house pays excise taxes on the full sale price. The amount of the varies by county. In King and Snohomish counties, it is up to 1.78%. For example, selling a house for $500K will cost you $8900 in taxes.   Residents of Washington are also obligated to pay a sales and use tax, which is incurred when a resident makes a purchase in another state and uses it within state lines, regardless of whether or not sales tax was paid in another state. This tax is based on an honor system for its residents and is seldom, if ever, paid.   The lowest combined sales tax (statewide and municipality) in Washington is 7.0% in most of Klickitat and Skamania Counties, while the highest combined sales tax in Washington is the aforementioned 9.5% tax on prepared food and beverages in King County.   April 1, 2008 saw tax increases in King County (+.001), Kittitas County (+.003), Mason County (+.001), and the city of Union Gap (+.002) [ 82 ] .   On July 1, 2008, Washington stopped charging an origin-based sales tax, and started charging a destination-based sales tax. This change only applies to transactions beginning and ending within state lines and does not apply to other states. [ 80 ]  Additionally, Washington started collecting taxes from online retailers that have voluntarily agreed to start collecting the sales tax in return for not being sued for back taxes. [ 83 ]   The city of Seattle charges a 7.5% tax on charges for parking garages to go toward mass transit.   On November 4, 2008, voters in King County (Seattle) approved a 0.5% increase in the sales tax. Taxes within the city will increase to 9.5% on retail purchases. This increase was supposed to be effective Jan. 1, 2009 but has been pushed back until April. For the first quarter of 2009 the tax rate in Seattle is 9%.     [ edit ]   West Virginia   West Virginia  has the distinction of being the first US state to enact a sales tax. [ 1 ]  It currently stands at 6%. The sales tax on food currently stands at 3%. Effective  January 1 ,  2006 , the sales tax on food was lowered to 5%, and on  July 1 ,  2007 , it was lowered further to 4%. The sales tax on food was again lowered to 3% on  July 1 ,  2008 . [ 84 ]  However, the reduced rate of tax does not apply to sales, purchases and uses by consumers of prepared food. Prescription drugs are not subject to sales tax. Credit is allowed for sales or use taxes paid to another state with respect to the purchase.   An individual who titles a motor vehicle with the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles must pay a $5.00 title fee and a 5 percent title privilege tax (rather than the 6 percent sales tax). For vehicles purchased new by West Virginia residents, the measure of this tax is the net sales price of the vehicle. For used vehicles, and for vehicles previously titled in other states, the tax is measured by the  National Automobile Dealers Association  book value of the vehicle at the time of registration. No credit is issued for any taxes paid to another state. Trailers, motorboats, all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles are also subject to this tax. [ 85 ]  As of June 7, 2007, new residents of West Virginia no longer have to pay the 5 percent title privilege tax on vehicles, as long as the vehicles were validly titled to the same owner outside the state. [ 86 ]     [ edit ]   Wisconsin   Wisconsin  has a 5% state sales tax, with most of the 72 counties charging an extra 0.5% ""County Tax"". Five counties ( Milwaukee ,  Ozaukee ,  Racine ,  Washington ,  Waukesha ) have a 0.1% tax for purchases over $10 that funds the building of  Miller Park  in  Milwaukee .  Brown County  ( Green Bay ) has a 0.5% tax for purchases over $10 which funds the reconstruction of  Lambeau Field . Prescriptions, most non-prepared foods (including meat and dairy), and newspapers are exempt; however over-the-counter medications are not. [ 87 ]     [ edit ]   Wyoming   Wyoming  has a 4% state sales tax, with counties adding an additional 0% to 2%, resulting in a maximum rate of 6%. In addition, resort district areas have the option to impose an additional 1% tax. Food for domestic home consumption is exempt from sales tax.

[ edit ]   Sales tax planning   See also:  Sales tax audit   In the United States, corporate sales tax planning may include the following:     Determination of ways to legally reduce the amount of tax due on a transaction. For instance, how a company structures its invoices can affect the taxability of the entire transaction. Each U.S. state has different rules for applying sales tax. Some states laws are more advantageous to taxpayer for certain types of transactions. If a business operates in several states, choosing the best state to take delivery in can reduce or eliminate sales tax liability. [ 89 ]  In many states an item can become taxable if not separately stated on the invoice.   Review of company purchases to determine which assets may qualify for exemptions. Finding overlooked exemptions often results in significant savings.   Periodic review of procedures relating to Sales & Use Tax data gathering and retention so that proper supporting documentation, including exemption and resale certificates, are available in the event of a State audit.

It was widely used in more than five thousand manufacturing processes and products throughout the twentieth century. Asbestos was most widely used in the manufacture of construction materials and in the ship-building industry.    Asbestos rope and yarn has been used as packing and insulation on jointing and pipes, as around windows, as insulation for electrical equipment, and for a variety of other purposes. Asbestos rope typically contained at least 40% asbestos depending on its function.    The Dangers of Asbestos    Asbestos poses serious health hazards because it is made of tiny fibers that can become airborne, and inhaled into the lungs or otherwise ingested. These fibers cannot be excreted once they are in the lungs, and over time and repeated exposure the presence of asbestos fibers leads to the development of lethal lung diseases such as asbestosis and mesothelioma cancer.    Mesothelioma is a particularly lethal form of cancer because it is very difficult to diagnose. The symptoms of mesothelioma are non-specific, and in the early stages of the disease may be mistaken for symptoms of influenza or pneumonia. In addition, there is no cure for mesothelioma, and treatments are often ineffective because the disease is diagnosed too late. Of the two thousand Americans diagnosed with mesothelioma every year, only fifty percent will survive more than two years after diagnosis.    The presence of asbestos in residential or commercial buildings is not always a health risk. The fibers are dangerous only when airborne, and if asbestos-containing materials are in good condition and left undisturbed, the chances of this occurring are minimal. The greatest danger is to people who were involved in manufacturing processes that involved the use of asbestos, and people working in construction industries such as ship-building when asbestos products were in use.    Asbestos and your Legal Rights    In 1977, the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the use of asbestos in most construction materials, and asbestos use for other industrial purposes became more tightly regulated. However, this ban came far too late for many thousands of workers, even though the dangers of asbestos had been known as early as the 1930s. Many companies that used asbestos in manufacturing did not provide their workers with adequate protection. The greatest tragedy of the use of asbestos is that many thousands of workers were exposed to asbestos unnecessarily.    If you or a family member has developed an asbestos-related disease such as mesothelioma, you may be able to claim financial compensation from the company that was responsible. Compensation can provide for the costs of medical treatment and care, replace lost income if you are unable to work, and provide some justice for the emotional suffering and loss of quality of life that diseases such as mesothelioma inflict on victims and their loved ones. Just as important, the company responsible is held accountable for their failure to protect you from asbestos exposure, and you can obtain some justice for this. Don't hesitate to contact an experienced mesothelioma lawyer who can explain your legal rights, help you gather information about your asbestos exposure, and help you start legal proceedings.

A  sales tax  is a tax on  consumption , which is displayed as a  percentage  of the sale price. Sales taxes are assessed by every  state  except Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon. Hawaii has a similar  tax  although it is charged to businesses instead of consumers. In some cases, sales taxes are also assessed at the  county  or  municipal  level.   The sales tax is the responsibility of the merchant to collect and remand to the state, and stated separately (or implicitly added at the time of sale) to consumers. Usually only consumers are charged the tax; resellers are exempt if they do not make use of the goods. In some jurisdictions, a reseller's certificate is required to make use of this privilege. This is in contrast to a  Value Added Tax  (VAT), where resellers are also taxed (resellers may then claim the VAT paid on their purchases from the applicable authority). States which have exemptions for specific types of organizations (such as schools), may also require a certificate. A  sales tax audit  is the examination of a companys financial documents by the states tax agency to verify if they have collected the correct amount of sales tax from their customers.   The  Constitution of the United States  limits the power of the states to subjects within their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction over interstate commerce is reserved to the federal government. Nevertheless, a  resident  of a state with a sales tax who purchases goods from a place with no sales tax (or at a lower rate) might be subject to pay a "" use tax "" (often at the same rate as the state sales tax) for non-exempt purchases  (see also  tax-free shopping ) . While there is no  national sales tax  in the United States, the  Fair Tax Act , which would replace  federal income taxes  with a sales tax and monthly rebate, has attracted interest in the  United States Congress  and the  2008 presidential campaign .

Georgia passed legislation enacting a sales tax in 1929. 11 other states enacted sales taxes in 1933 alone. By 1940, at least 30 states had a sales tax. [ 1 ]  Currently, 45 of the 50 U.S. States levy a sales and use tax against purchases.  [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   States and federal districts     [ edit ]   Alabama   Alabama  has a state general sales tax of 4%, plus any additional local taxes which can amount to a combined total sales tax of up to 10% in some cities such as Montgomery. Alabama is one of several states that do not exempt food from state taxes. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Alaska   There is no state sales tax in  Alaska ; however, local governments (boroughs and their municipalities) may levy up to 7%, and 108 of them do so. [ 4 ]  Municipal sales taxes are collected in addition to borough sales taxes, if any. Regulations and exemptions vary widely across the state. [ 5 ]   Anchorage  and  Fairbanks  do not charge a local sales tax.     [ edit ]   Arizona   Arizona  has a  transaction privilege tax (TPT)  that differs from a ""true"" sales tax in that the tax is levied on the gross receipts of the vendor and is not a liability of the consumer. [ 6 ]  (As explained in Arizona Administrative Code rule R15-5-2202, [ 7 ]  vendors are permitted to pass the amount of the tax on to the consumer, but remain the liable parties for the tax to the state.) TPT is imposed under sixteen tax classifications (as of November 1, 2006), [ 8 ]  with the tax rate most commonly encountered by Arizona consumers (e.g., for retail transactions) set at 5.6%. The current tax as of 2009 is 6.1%, [ 9 ]  though cities and counties can add as much as 6% to the total rate. [ 10 ]  Food for home consumption and prescription drugs (including  legend drugs  and certain prescribed  homeopathic medication ) are two of many items of tangible personal property that are statutorily exempt from the retail TPT. Arizona's TPT is one of the few excise taxes in the country imposed on contracting activities rather than sales of construction materials. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Arkansas   Arkansas  has a state sales tax of 6%, plus any additional local taxes.   Effective  July 1 ,  2007 , Arkansas state sales tax on unprepared food (groceries) reduced to 3%. Local sales taxes on groceries remained unchanged.     [ edit ]   California   California  has a statewide sales tax of 7.25%, and local supplementary taxes are allowed up to 9.25%. Sales and use taxes in the state of California are collected by the publicly elected tax commission in the United States. The statewide 7.25% is allocated as: [ 12 ]     7.25% - State    5.00% - State - General Fund   0.25% - State - Fiscal Recovery Fund   0.50% - State - Local Revenue Fund   0.50% - State - Local Public Safety Fund   1.00% -  Uniform Local Tax     0.25% - Local County - Transportation funds   0.75% - Local City/County - Operational funds             On April 1, 2009 the state sales and use tax will increase by 1% as a result of the  2008-2009 California budget crisis . The minimum sales tax statewide will be 8.25%. [ 13 ] [ 14 ]   Supplementary sales tax may be added (with voter approval) by cities, counties, service authorities, and various special districts (such as the  Bay Area Rapid Transit  district). The effect is that sales tax rates vary from 7.25% (in areas where no additional taxes are charged) to 8.75% (for example, in the city of  Avalon , on  Santa Catalina Island , in  National City , and in  Alameda County ). On Oct. 1, 2008, the city of  South Gate  increased their sales-tax rate to 9.25%, the highest in California. [ 15 ]   The last changes to the published local tax rates took effect on  April 1 ,  2007 . Official updates are published on the Board of Equalization website and also in Publication 71. [ 16 ] [ 17 ]   In general, sales tax is required on all purchases of tangible personal property to its ultimate consumer. Services are not subject to sales tax (but may be subject to other taxes).   Vehicle purchases are taxed based on the city and county in which the purchaser registers the vehicle, and not on the county in which the vehicle is purchased. There is therefore no advantage in purchasing a car in a cheaper county to save on sales tax (a one-percent difference in sales tax rate would otherwise result in an additional $300 loss on a $30,000 car).   In grocery stores, unprepared food items are not taxed but vitamins and all other items are. Ready-to-eat hot foods, whether sold by supermarkets or other vendors, are taxed. Restaurant bills are taxed. As an exception, hot beverages and bakery items are tax-exempt if and only if they are for take-out and are not sold with any other hot food. If consumed on the seller's premises, such items are taxed like restaurant meals. All other food is exempt from sales tax.   Also excluded are food animals (livestock), food plants and seeds, fertilizer used to grow food, prescription drugs and certain medical supplies, energy utilities, certain alternative energy devices and supplies, art for display by public agencies, and veterans' pins. There are many specific exemptions for various veterans', non-profit, educational, religious, and youth organizations. Sale of items to certain out-of-state or national entities (mostly transportation companies) is exempt, as are some goods sold while in transit through California to a foreign destination.   Occasional or one-time sales not part of a regular business are exempt, except that sales of three or more non-food animals (puppies, kittens, etc.) per year are taxed.  [ 18 ]   There are also exemptions for numerous specific products, from telephone lines and poles, to liquid petroleum gas for farm machinery, to coins, to public transit vehicles. There are  partial  exemptions for such varied items as racehorse breeding stock, teleproduction service equipment, farm machinery, and timber-harvesting equipment. [ 19 ]  For an organized list of exemptions, with estimates for how much revenue the state loses and the people saves for each, see Publication 61 of the Board of Equalization. [ 20 ]   Sales tax is charged on gasoline. The tax is levied on both the gasoline and on the federal and state excise taxes, resulting in double taxation. The sales tax is included in the metered price at the pump. The California excise tax on gasoline is 18 cents a gallon. [ 21 ]   Motor vehicle gasoline and jet fuel are subject to special taxation regimes. In 2005, there was a political dispute in the San Francisco Bay Area about whether revenues for jet fuel should be credited to  San Mateo County  (where  San Francisco International Airport  is physically located), the City and County of  San Francisco , which owns the airport, or  Alameda County , where  Oakland International Airport  is located. (The distinction is largely point of delivery vs. point of negotiation for the sale.) This is controlled by Regulation 1802, [ 22 ]  which has other provisions about businesses which have multiple locations.   Critics of the current sales tax regime charge that it gives local governments an incentive to promote commercial development (through zoning and other regulations) over residential development, including the use of eminent domain condemnation proceedings to transfer real estate to higher sales tax generating businesses. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Colorado   Colorado 's state sales tax is 2.9% with some cities and counties levying additional taxes.  Denver 's tangibles tax is 3.62%, with food eaten away from the home being taxed at 4%. There is also a football stadium tax, mass transit tax, and scientific and cultural facilities tax. Most transactions in Denver and the surrounding area are taxed at a total of about 8%. Colorado does not charge sales tax on unprepared food (groceries).     [ edit ]   Connecticut   Connecticut  has a 6% sales tax, with no additional local taxes. Most non-prepared food products are exempt, as are most prescription and nonprescription medications, all internet services, all magazine and newspaper subscriptions, and textbooks (for college students only). Most clothing costing less than $50 per item is also exempt; items costing more than $50 are charged sales tax on the entire price. [ 24 ]   Shipping and delivery charges (including charges for U.S. postage) made by a retailer to a customer are subject to sales and use taxes when provided in connection with the sales of taxable tangible personal property or services. The tax applies even if the charges are separately stated and applies regardless of whether the shipping or delivery is provided by the seller or by a third party. No tax is due on shipping and delivery charges in connection with any sale that is not subject to sales or use tax. Shipping or delivery charges related to sales for resale or sales of exempt items are not taxable. Likewise, charges for mailing or delivery services are not subject to tax if they are made in connection with the sale of nontaxable services. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Delaware   Delaware does not assess a sales tax on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096 percent to 1.92 percent, depending upon the category of business activity.     [ edit ]   District of Columbia   Washington, D.C.  has a sales tax rate of 5.75%. The tax is imposed on sale of tangible personal property and selected services. A 9% tax is imposed on liquor sold for off premises consumption, 10% on restaurant meals and rental cars, 12% on parking, and 14% on hotel accommodations. Groceries, prescription and non-prescription drugs, and residential utilities services are exempt from the District's sales tax.  [ 26 ]   The District has two sales tax holidays each year, one during ""back-to-school"" and one preceding the holiday shopping season. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Florida   Florida  has a general sales tax rate of 6%. [ 28 ]  The tax is imposed on the sale or rental of goods, the sale of admissions, the lease, license, or rental of real property, the lease or rental of transient living accommodations, and the sale of a limited number of services such as commercial pest control, commercial cleaning, and certain protection services. There are a variety of exemptions from the tax, including groceries and prescriptions. [ 29 ]   A ""discretionary sales surtax"" may be imposed by the counties of up to 1.5%, charged at the rate of the destination county (if shipped). This is 1% in most counties, 0.5% in many, 1.5% in very few, and 0.25% in one county. A few have none at all. Most have an  expiration date , but a few do not. Only the first $5,000 of a large purchase is subject to the surtax rate. [ 30 ]  Most counties levy the surtax for education or transportation improvements.   There are annual sales tax holidays, such as a back-to-school holiday on clothing, books, and school supplies under a certain price, as well as a new one in June 2007 to promote  hurricane preparedness . The 2008 Legislators did not enact any sales tax holidays.   Florida also permits counties to raise a ""tourist development tax"" of up to an additional 6% on hotel rooms.     [ edit ]   Georgia   Georgia  has a 4% state sales tax rate. Groceries are exempt from the state sales tax, but still subject to tax by the local sales tax rate. Counties may impose local sales tax of 1%, 2%, or 3%, consisting of up to three 1% local-option sales taxes (out of a set of five) as permitted by Georgia law. These include a  SPLOST , a  homestead exemption  (HOST), and one for  public schools  which can be put forth for a  referendum  by the  school board  instead of the  county commission  (in cooperation with its  city councils ). Also, the city of  Atlanta  imposes an additional 1% municipal-option sales tax (MOST), as allowed by  special legislation  of the  Georgia General Assembly , solely for the purpose of fixing its  water  and  sewerage  systems.   As of July 2008, total sales tax rates in Georgia are 3% for groceries and 7% for other items in the vast majority of  its 159 counties . A few counties charge only 2% local tax (6% total on non-grocery items), and four partially exempt groceries from the local tax by charging 2% on food, and 3% (7% total) on other items. Fulton and DeKalb counties charge 1% for  MARTA , and adjacent  metro Atlanta  counties may do so by referendum if they so choose. For the portions of Fulton and DeKalb within the city of Atlanta, the total is at 8% (4% on groceries) due to the MOST. [ 31 ]   Similar to Florida and certain other states, Georgia has two sales tax holidays per year. One is for  back-to-school  sales the first weekend in August, but sometimes starting at the end of July. A second usually occurs in October, for  energy-efficient   appliances  with the  Energy Star   certification .   Georgia has many exemptions available to specific businesses and industries. To identify potential exemptions, businesses and consumers must research the laws and rules for sales and use tax and review current exemption forms.  [ 32 ]     [ edit ]   Hawaii   Hawaii  does not have a sales tax, but it does have an  excise tax  which applies to nearly every conceivable type of  transaction  (including  services ), and is technically charged to the  business  rather than the  consumer . Unlike other states, businesses may or may not show the tax separately on the  receipt , as it is technically part of the selling price. 4.0% is charged at  retail  with an additional 0.5% surcharge in the  City and County of Honolulu  (for a total of 4.5% on Oahu sales), and 0.5% is charged on  wholesale   [7] . However the state also allows ""tax on tax"" to be charged, which effectively means a customer is billed 4.166% (4.712% on Oahu). The exact dollar or percentage amount to be added must be quoted to customers within or along with the price. The 0.5% surcharge on Oahu was implemented to fund the new rail transport system.  [ 33 ]  The use of an excise tax means that  tax-exempt   non-profit organizations  must pay the tax, unlike states where they are exempt from sales taxes.     [ edit ]   Idaho   Idaho  has a 6.0% state sales tax. Some localities levy an additional local sales tax. [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   Illinois   Illinois'  sales and use tax scheme includes four major divisions. Retailers' Occupation Tax, Use Tax, Service Occupation Tax and the Service Use Tax. Each of these taxes is administered by the Illinois Department of Revenue. The Retailers' Occupation Tax is imposed upon persons engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property to purchasers for use or consumption. It is measured by the gross receipts of the retailer. The base rate of 6.25% is broken down as follows: 5% State, 1% City, 0.25% County. Local governments may impose additional tax resulting in a combined rate that ranges from the State minimum of 6.25% to a current high of 11.50% in certain business districts in Cook County. [ 35 ] . A complementary Use Tax is imposed upon the privilege of using or consuming property purchased anywhere at retail from a retailer. Illinois registered retailers are authorized to collect the Use Tax from their customers and use it to offset their obligations under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. Since the Use Tax rate is equivalent to the corresponding Retailers' Occupation Tax rate, the amount collected by the retailer matches the amount the retailer must submit to the Illinois Department of Revenue. The combination of these two taxes is what is commonly referred to as ""sales tax"". If the purchaser does not pay the Use Tax directly to a retailer (for instance, on an item purchased from an Internet seller), they must remit it directly to the Illinois Department of Revenue. [ 36 ]   The Service Occupation Tax is imposed upon the privilege of engaging in service businesses and is measured by the selling price of tangible personal property transferred as an incident to providing a service. The Service Use Tax is imposed upon the privilege of using or consuming tangible personal property transferred as an incident to the provision of a service. An example would be a printer of business cards. The printer owes Service Occupation Tax on the value of the paper and ink transferred to the customer in the form of printed business cards. The serviceperson may satisfy this tax by paying Use Tax to his supplier of paper and ink or, alternatively, may charge Service Use Tax to the purchaser of the business cards and remit the amount collected as Service Occupation Tax on the serviceperson's tax return. The service itself, however, is not subject to tax.   Qualifying food, drugs, medicines and medical appliances [ 37 ]  have sales tax of 1% plus local home rule tax depending on the location where purchased. Newspapers and magazines are exempt from sales tax as are legal tender, currency, medallions, bullion or gold or silver coinage issued by the State of Illinois, the government of the United States of America, or the government of any foreign country.   Illinois' system is exceptionally complicated. A brief overview is detailed on the Illinois Department of Revenue website. [ 38 ]   The city of Chicago has the highest total sales tax of all major U.S. cities. [ 39 ]  It is also one of the most complex. 10.25% is levied on all non-perishable goods purchased, while 2% is levied on qualifying food, drugs, medicines and medical appliances. [ 39 ]  The Illinois Department of Revenue collects a 3% Chicago Soft Drink Tax and a 1%  Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority  (MPEA) ""Food and Beverage Tax"", on prepared food and beverage purchases in the downtown area (These ""downtown"" boundaries are: Surf Street on the north, Ashland Avenue on the west, Stevenson Expressway (I-55) on the south, & Lake Michigan on the east. Furthermore, O'Hare and Midway airports also fall under the 1% MPEA tax district). [ 40 ]  In addition, the Chicago Department of Revenue collects additional sales taxes on items such as fountain drinks, bottled water, liquor, and cigarettes. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Indiana   Indiana  has a 7% state sales tax. The tax rate was raised from 6% on  April 1 ,  2008 , to offset the loss of revenue from the statewide property tax reform, which is expected to significantly lower property taxes. Untaxed retail items include medications, water, ice and unprepared, raw staple foods or fruit juices. Many localities, inclusive of either counties or cities, in the state of Indiana also have a sales tax on restaurant food and beverages consumed in the restaurant or purchased to go. Revenues are usually used for economic development and tourism projects. This additional tax rate may be 1% or 2% or other amounts depending on the county in which the business is located. For example, in  Marion County, Indiana , the sales tax for restaurants is 9%.     [ edit ]   Iowa   As of July 1, 2008,  Iowa  has a 6% state sales tax. Most counties impose local option sales taxes of up to 1% each, bringing the total up to 7%. There is no tax on most unprepared food, excluding corn. The Iowa Department of Revenue provides information about local option sales taxes, [ 42 ]  including sales tax rate lookup.     [ edit ]   Kansas   Kansas  has a 5.3% state sales tax. More than 700 jurisdictions within the state (cities, counties, and special districts) may impose additional taxes. For example, in the capital city of  Topeka , retailers must collect 5.3% for the state, 1.15% for  Shawnee County , and 1% for the city, for a total rate of 7.45%. As of February 2007, the highest rate was 8.65%, in the  Roeland Park  Transportation District.     [ edit ]   Kentucky   Kentucky  has a 6% state sales tax. Alcohol (until April 1, 2009) and most staple grocery foods are exempt.     [ edit ]   Louisiana   Louisiana  has a 4% state sales tax: 3.97% to sales tax and .03% to Louisiana tourism district. [ 43 ]  There are also taxes on the  parish  (county) level and some on the city levels. [ 44 ]  Parishes may add local taxes up to 5%, while local jurisdictions within parishes may add more. Louisiana also bids out sales tax audits to private companies, with many being paid on a percentage collected basis.   Orleans Parish collects the maximum 5% tax rate for a total of 9% on general purpose items. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Maine   Maine  has a 5% general, service provider and use tax. [ 46 ]  The tax on lodging and prepared food is 7% and short term auto rental is 10%. These are all generally known as ""sales tax"".     [ edit ]   Maryland   Maryland  has a 6% state sales and use tax as of  January 3 ,  2008  (it was 5% before this), with exceptions for medicine, residential energy, and most non-prepared foods. Currently, many services (e.g., auto repair labor, haircuts, accounting) are not taxed. With this tax increase, Maryland added sales tax on Internet purchases and other mail items such as magazine subscriptions. Clothing is also taxable.   Certain computer services were to be subject to sales tax and use tax effective July 1, 2008 after being approved without public hearing during the 2007 Special Legislative Session. [ 47 ]  However, after effective lobbying by computer services professionals, the tax was repealed April 6th during the final days of the General Assembly. Following declining approval ratings and intense public pressure, Governor  Martin O'Malley  relented and authorized the repeal.     [ edit ]   Massachusetts   Massachusetts  has a 5% sales tax, replete with numerous exceptions including (among other things): ""food products"" (but excluding prepared meals); residential water, gas, electric services; returnable containers, clothing and footwear up to $175 (for clothing over $175, tax is due only on the amount over $175 per item [ 48 ] ); prescription medicines, prostheses and medical appliances or services; publications for use in education or religious worship; poultry and livestock, as well as their feed; fruit and vegetable stock for generating food for humans; tools, machinery, parts, etc., for use in agriculture; cloth or other materials used for making clothing; residential heat pump, solar or wind power system; items purchasable with federal food stamps; the American Flag; etc. An enacted change in 2006 taxes computer software that is downloaded for use in Massachusetts, whereas previously this was viewed as a non-taxable ""service"". [ 49 ]   Every year since 2004, the State Government has enacted tax holidays suspending the sales tax on purchases for one weekend in August. Motor vehicles, motorboats, meals, telecommunications services, gas, steam, electricity, tobacco products, and any single item with a price exceeding $2,500 were excluded from the holiday. [ 50 ]     [ edit ]   Michigan   Michigan  has a 6% sales tax. Michigan has a use tax of 6%, which is a tax that is applied to items brought into Michigan but not bought there, and on rentals in some situations, and is supposed to be paid when filing income tax. [ 51 ]  A service tax was approved in September 2007, effective December 1st, 2007, allowing certain services to be taxed. The services tax was repealed the same day it went into effect. There is no local sales tax in Michigan. Food, periodicals [ 52 ] , and prescription drugs are not taxed. Restaurants, however, do have a tax, but the tax is for the service and not on the food. Michigan also has recently introduced a business tax called the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) which replaces the Single Business Tax (SBT). [ 53 ]     [ edit ]   Minnesota   Minnesota  currently has a 6.5% state sales tax. A statewide referendum passed on Nov. 4, 2008 which will add 3/8 of 1 percent, bringing the total to 6.875%. The new rate will go into effect on July 1, 2009. [ 54 ]  As of  July 1 ,  2008 , an additional 0.25%  Transit Improvement tax  was phased in across five counties in the  Minneapolis-St. Paul  metropolitan area for transit development. These counties include  Hennepin ,  Ramsey ,  Anoka ,  Dakota ,  Washington . The Transit Improvement tax brings taxes in these counties to 7.125%. Saint Paul imposes an additional 0.5% tax, bringing the total to 7.625%. An additional 0.15% is imposed in  Hennepin County  to finance a new  Minnesota Twins  stadium, in addition to 0.5% imposed in Minneapolis, bringing the total rate in the city of Minneapolis to 7.775% and 7.275% in the rest of Hennepin County. Food (not including prepared food, some beverages such as soda pop, and other items such as candy) and clothing are exempt from the sales tax. Prescription drugs are also exempt. [ 55 ]  Municipalities may be allowed by the state legislature to institute local option taxes. Rochester imposes a 0.5% for a total of 7.375% sales tax. Current local option taxes include a ""lodging"" tax in Duluth (3%), Minneapolis (3%), and Rochester (4%), as well as served ""food and beverage"" tax in Duluth (2.25%). An additional 1% sales tax is imposed in Duluth, bringing the total to 7.875%. Alcohol has a 9% sales tax statewide (6.5% sales tax, plus 2.5% gross receipts tax) not including any applicable local taxes. In addition to the local 1% sales tax added to Duluth sales, Duluth imposes an additional 2.25% tax on all food, beverage and alcohol sales at restaurants.     [ edit ]   Mississippi   Mississippi  has a 7% state sales tax. Cities and towns may implement an additional tourism tax on restaurant and hotel sales. The city of Tupelo has a 0.25% tax in addition to other taxes. Restaurant and fast food tax is 9%. The city of Hattiesburg also has a 9% sales tax on Restaurant and fast food tax.     [ edit ]   Missouri   Missouri  has a 4.225% state sales & use tax rate. The state sales tax rate on certain foods is 1.225%. Counties, cities, and special taxing districts may impose additional sales & use taxes.   Transportation Development Districts and Museum Districts may impose sales tax (but not use tax) up to 1%, in addition to all other sales taxes. However, the Missouri Department of Revenue does not administer sales tax for these districts, nor does it publish their sales tax rates. As of August 2007, there is no public, comprehensive and complete list of these districts, their locations, and the sales tax rates they impose.     [ edit ]   Montana   Montana  does not have a state sales tax but some municipalities which are big tourist destinations, such as  Whitefish ,  Red Lodge ,  Big Sky , and  West Yellowstone , have a small sales tax (0.25%).     [ edit ]   Nebraska   Nebraska  has a 5.5% state sales tax. Municipalities have the option of imposing an additional sales tax of up to 1.5%. Specific tax rates per counties are available on the web. [ 56 ]     [ edit ]   Nevada   Nevada 's state sales tax rate is 6.5 percent. Counties may impose additional rates via voter approval or through approval of the Legislature; therefore, the applicable sales tax varies by county from 6.5 percent to 7.75 percent (in Clark County), as of  October 1 ,  2007 . Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, imposes four separate county option taxes in addition to the statewide rate - 0.25 percent for flood control, 0.50 percent for mass transit, 0.25 to fund the Southern Nevada Water Authority, and 0.25 percent for the addition of police officers in that county. In Washoe County (which includes Reno), the sales tax rate is 7.375 percent, due to county option rates for flood control, the ReTRAC train trench project, mass transit, and an additional county rate approved under the Local Government Tax Act of 1991. [ 57 ]   For travelers to Las Vegas, note that the lodging tax rate in unincorporated Clark County, which includes the  Las Vegas Strip , is 9%. Within the boundaries of the City of Las Vegas, the lodging tax rate is 11%.     [ edit ]   New Hampshire   New Hampshire  is one of only five states that do not impose any form of general sales tax on the sale or use of tangible personal property within the state. New Hampshire does, however, levy a tax on meals, room occupancies, motor vehicle rentals, and use of electricity (55 cents per megawatt-hour) and phone services (7 percent). A transfer tax is levied on real estate sales, currently 0.15 percent.   In New Hampshire, any food or beverage that is prepared and served by a ""restaurant,"" whether served for consumption on or off the restaurant premises, is considered to be a meal. Excluded from the tax is any food and beverage that is wholly packaged off the premises and sold in the original package, such as chips, candy, soda or fruit beverages in sealed containers, and frozen novelties. Catered or delivered meals or party platters are taxable, as are charges for any service or items related to preparing or serving the food (plates, ovens, etc). Restaurants include most places where you can buy any food. There are several other exceptions. For example, meals served or furnished on the premises of a religious or charitable nonprofit organization are not taxable, nor are bakery products sold in quantity of 6 or more servings, or a whole pie, cake, or loaf of bread with multiple servings.   The New Hampshire meals and rooms tax rate is 8% on any amount over 35 cents (including any alcohol served on premise). The rooms tax is imposed on any occupancy in a hotel, house, apartment, dormitory, camp, cottage or any similar establishment offering sleeping accommodations in the State of New Hampshire, for any rental less than 185 days, not including bare campsites without shelter. The tax rate is currently 8% of the rent for each occupancy. A motor vehicle rental tax is imposed under the meals and room tax classification at a rate of 8% on the gross rental receipts of each rental, but not including separately itemized fuel, insurance or damage charges.   Gasoline tax is 20.6 per gallon. Cigarettes: $1.08 per pack. Beer: 30 per gallon.     See also   tax-free shopping .       [ edit ]   New Jersey   New Jersey  The State of New Jerseys sales and use tax rate is seven percent (7%). However, there are exceptions to this statewide rate. In Urban Enterprise Zones, UEZ-impacted business districts, and in Salem County, sales tax may be charged at 3.5% (50% of the regular rate) on certain items. In addition, local sales taxes are imposed on sales of certain items sold in Atlantic City and Cape May County. For additional information, see Tax Topic Bulletin S&U-4, New Jersey Sales Tax Guide, available at:  http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/pubs/sales/su4.pdf   A full list of Urban Enterprise Zones is available on the State of New Jersey Web site. [ 58 ]   New Jersey does not charge sales tax on unprepared food (except certain sweets and pet food), household paper products, medicine, and clothing. New Jersey does not charge sales tax on goods purchased for resale or on capital improvements but does charge sales tax on certain services. See the NJ Division of Taxation website at:  http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/su.shtml   New Jersey does not charge sales tax on gasoline, but gasoline is subject to a $0.145/gallon  excise tax .   Sales of clothing and accessories that are made of fur from the hide or pelt of an animal that is valued at $500 or more are subject to a 6% Fur Clothing Gross Receipts Tax.     [ edit ]   New Mexico   The state of  New Mexico  does not have a sales tax. It instead has a statewide  gross receipts tax  of 5%, with municipalities assessing an additional gross receipts tax. The gross receipts tax rate is between 5.125% and 8.4375% throughout the state  [ 59 ]  . In New Mexico's gross receipts tax, all receipts from sales of goods or service within the state are taxed (with the exception of food for offsite consumption, such as grocery store sales).   The state does not prohibit retailers from collecting this tax directly from the consumer, so the gross receipts tax is commonly just passed on from the retailer to the consumer as if it were a sales tax.     [ edit ]   New York   New York  has a 4% state sales tax. All counties and some cities add local taxes ranging from 3% to 4.75%. The combined sales tax in  Utica, New York , for example, is 8.75%. In  New York City , total sales tax is 8.375%, which includes 0.375% charged for the service of the  Metropolitan Transportation Authority .   There is no New York City sales tax imposed on the purchase of clothing and footwear regardless of the amount. As of September 1, 2007, New York State has eliminated sales tax on all clothing and shoes if the single item is priced under $110. Most counties and cities have not eliminated their local sales taxes on clothing and shoes. There are however, 11 counties and 5 cities (most notably New York City, New York, Queens, Kings, Richmond, and Bronx, which make up New York City are not counted)) that have done so. The counties where the year-round exemption will apply include: Chautauqua, Chenango, Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, Hamilton, Madison (outside the City of Oneida), Rensselaer, Tioga, Broome, and Wayne. The cities where the year-round exemption will apply include: Gloversville, New York City, Norwich, Olean, Binghamton, and Sherrill. New York also exempts college textbooks from sales tax.   As of  June 1 ,  2008 , when products are purchased online and shipped within New York State, the retailer must charge the tax amount appropriate to the locality where the goods are shipped, and in addition, must also charge the appropriate tax on the cost of shipping and handling.     [ edit ]   North Carolina   North Carolina  has a state-levied sales tax of 4.5%, effective October 1, 2008, with most counties adding an additional 2.5% tax, for a total tax of 7%.  Mecklenburg County  levies an additional 0.5% tax, which is directed towards funding the  light rail system , for a total of 7.5%.   There is a 30.2 tax per gallon on  gas , a 35 tax per pack of cigarettes, a 79 tax per gallon on wine, and a 53 tax per gallon on beer. Most non-prepared food purchases are taxed at a reduced rate of 2%. Candy, soft drinks, and prepared foods are taxed at the full combined 7% rate, with some counties levying an additional 1% tax on prepared foods. In order to benefit back-to-school shoppers, there is a  sales tax holiday  that exempts certain items of tangible personal property sold between the first Friday in August and the following Sunday.     [ edit ]   North Dakota   North Dakota  has a 5% state sales tax for general sales. Sales Tax in North Dakota varies depending on the category. (5%, 7%, 3% and 2%)  [ 60 ]     [ edit ]   Ohio   Ohio  has a 5.5% state sales tax.  [ 61 ]  Counties may levy a permissive sales tax of from 1/4% up to 2.5% and transit authorities, mass transit districts usually centered on one primary county, may levy a sales tax of from 1/4% up to 2.5%. Cuyahoga county has the highest sales tax of 7.75%. Tax increments may not be less than 1/4%, and the total tax rate, including the state rate, may not exceed 8.5%. County permissive taxes may be levied by emergency resolution of the county boards of commissioners. Transit authority taxes must and county permissive taxes may be levied by a vote of the electors of the district or county. Shipping and handling charges are considered part of the retail price and are also taxable. Ohio also has a  gross receipts tax  called the  Commercial Activity Tax (CAT)  that is applicable only to businesses but shares some similarities to a sales tax.     [ edit ]   Oklahoma   Oklahoma  has a 4.5% sales tax rate. Cities have an additional sales tax which varies, but is generally 3-4% resulting in a total sales tax rate of 7.5% to 8.5%.     [ edit ]   Oregon   Oregon  has no statewide sales tax, although local municipalities may impose sales taxes if they so choose. The city of  Ashland , for example, charges a 5% sales tax on prepared food. Several Oregon communities assess sales taxes on lodging.     [ edit ]   Pennsylvania   Pennsylvania  has a 6% sales tax rate.  Allegheny County  and  Philadelphia County  have an additional 1% sales tax.   Food, most clothing, and footwear are among the items most frequently exempted. [ 62 ]  However, taxed food items include  soft drinks  and powdered mixes,  sports drinks , hot beverages, hot prepared foods,  sandwiches , and  salad bar  meals, unless these items are purchased with  food stamps . Additionally, catering and delivery fees are taxed if the food itself is taxed.   Additional exemptions include internet service, [ 63 ]   newspapers ,  textbooks ,  disposable diapers ,  feminine hygiene  products,  toilet paper ,  wet wipes ,  prescription drugs , many  over-the-counter drugs  and supplies,  oral hygiene  items (including  toothbrushes  and  toothpaste ),  contact lenses  and  eyeglasses ,  health club  and  tanning booth  fees, burial items (like  coffins ,  urns , and  headstones ),  personal protective equipment  for production personnel, work  uniforms ,  veterinary  services, pet medications,  fuel  for residential use (including  coal ,  firewood ,  fuel oil ,  natural gas ,  steam , and  electricity ), many  farming  supplies and equipment, and  ice . [ 64 ]     [ edit ]   Puerto Rico   Puerto Rico  has a 5.5%  commonwealth sales tax  that applies to both products and services with few exemptions (including items such as unprocessed foods, prescription medicines and business-to-business services). Additionally, most municipalities have a city sales tax of 1.5% for a total of 7%. Some items that are exempt from commonwealth sales tax, specifically unprocessed foods, may still be subject to the city sales tax in the municipalities.  [ 65 ]     [ edit ]   Rhode Island   Rhode Island  has a state sales tax of 7%. The rate was raised from 1% to 6% as a temporary measure in the 1970s, but has not since been lowered.   Rhode Island raised its sales tax from 6% to 7% in the early 1990s to pay for the bailout of the state's failed credit unions. The change was initially proposed as a temporary measure, but was later made permanent.   Other taxes may also apply, such as the state's 1% restaurant tax.   Many items are exempt from the state sales tax, e.g., food, prescription drugs, clothing and footwear, newspapers, coffins, and original artwork. [ 66 ]     [ edit ]   South Carolina   South Carolina  has a 6% state sales tax, as of  June 1 ,  2007  (7% for accommodations), but counties and some cities may impose an additional 1% or 2% sales tax. As of mid-2005, 35 of 46 counties do so. Restaurants may also charge an extra 1-2% tax on prepared food (fast food or take-out) in some places. The state's sales tax on unprepared food disappeared completely  November 1 ,  2007 . There is a cap of $300 on sales tax for most vehicles.   Additionally, signs posted in many places of business inform that South Carolina residents over the age of 85 are entitled to a 1% reduction in sales tax.     [ edit ]   South Dakota   South Dakota  has a 4% state sales tax, plus any additional local taxes. An additional 1% sales tax is added during the summer season on sales occurring in tourism-related businesses and dedicated to the state's office of tourism.     [ edit ]   Tennessee   Tennessee  charges 5.5% sales tax on groceries as of  January 1 ,  2008 , and 7% on other items. Counties also tax up to 2.75% in increments of 0.25%  most do so around 2.25%. If a county does not charge the maximum, its cities can charge and keep all or part of the  remainder . Several cities are in more than one county, but none charge a city tax, thus paying only the county taxes. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]     [ edit ]   Texas   The  Texas  state sales and use tax rate is 6.25%, but local taxing jurisdictions (cities, counties, special purpose districts, and transit authorities) may also impose sales and use taxes up to 2% for a total of 8.25%. [ 69 ]  Medicine, produce, eggs, meats, bakery products, and others are exempt from tax. [ 70 ]  In May 2006, Texas imposed a 1% tax on the  gross receipts  of businesses (retailers pay a .5 percent rate), but exempts sole proprietorships and general partnerships. [ 71 ]   If merchants file and pay their sales & use tax on time, they may subtract 1/2 percent of the tax collected as a discount, to encourage prompt payment and to compensate the merchant for collecting the tax from consumers for the state.  [ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Utah   Utah  has a 4.75% state sales tax. Additionally, local taxing authorities can impose their own sales tax. Currently the majority of Utah's aggregate sales taxes are in the range of 5.5% - 7.0%. [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Vermont   Vermont  has a 6% sales tax. [ 74 ]     [ edit ]   Virginia   Virginia  has a general sales tax rate of 5% (4% state tax and 1% local tax). Consumers are taxed on every 'eligible food item.' For example, fresh local  produce  sold at farmers markets and grocery stores, or basic, unprepared cold  grocery  foods, are taxed 2.5% (1.5% state tax and 1% local tax). [ 75 ]  Cities and counties may also charge an additional ""Food and Beverage Tax"" on restaurant meals. [ 76 ]   Virginia's use tax also applies at the same rate for out of state purchases (food 2.5%, non-food 5%)exceeding $100 per year. [ 77 ]  Various exemptions include prescription and non-prescription medicine [ 78 ] , gasoline [need citation, but was told not to report gas purchases], and postage stamps, or the labor portion of vehicle repair (parts portion only, citation needed). ""Cost price"" does not include separately stated shipping or delivery charges but it does include a ""shipping and handling"" charge if listed as a combined item on the sales invoice. [ 79 ]  However, unlike Maryland and West Virginia consumer use tax forms, the Virginia CU-7 Consumer Use Tax Form does not recognize that it is possible to be  under-taxed  in another state and so only addresses  untaxed  items only. Unlike Maryland's quarterly filing, Virginia's CU-7 is due annually between  January 1  and  May 1  or can be filed optionally instead with Schedule ADJ with Form 760, or Schedule NPY with Form 760PY. As with all states, Virginia has penalties and interest for non-filing, but Virginia's use tax is no more practically enforceable than that of any other state.     [ edit ]   Washington   Washington  has a 6.5% statewide sales tax. As of  October 31 ,  2007 , sales tax is not applied on most food items and prescription medications (not including over-the-counter medications). Individual counties, municipalities and regional transit authorities are entitled to collect a sales tax, which vary from 0.5% to 2.5%. Within King County, the King County Food & Beverage (KCF&B) tax adds an additional .5% to food and beverages purchased in bars, taverns and restaurants resulting in an effective tax rate of 9.5% (9.0% on all other items). [ 80 ]  Additionally, the sale or lease of motor vehicles for use on the road incur an additional 0.3% tax, rental of a car for less than 30 days has an additional state/local tax of 8.9%. [ 80 ]  When renting a car for less than 30 days in Seattle, the total sales tax is 18.6%. When purchasing an automobile, if you trade in a car, the state subtracts the price of the trade when calculating the sales tax to be paid on the automobile (e.g., purchasing a $40,000 car and trading a $20,000 car, you would be taxed on the difference of $20,000 only, not the full amount of the new vehicle).   When staying at hotel (60+ rooms capacity) in Seattle, the sales tax is 15.6%. Residents of Canada and US states or possessions (only US and Canadian locations having a sales tax of less than 3%, e.g., Oregon, Alaska & Alberta) are exempt from sales tax on purchases of tangible  personal property  for use outside the state. Stores at the border will inquire about residency and exempt qualified purchasers from the tax. [ 81 ]  Washington also has a  Gross receipts tax  called the Business and Occupations Tax (B&O).   Also, the seller of a house pays excise taxes on the full sale price. The amount of the varies by county. In King and Snohomish counties, it is up to 1.78%. For example, selling a house for $500K will cost you $8900 in taxes.   Residents of Washington are also obligated to pay a sales and use tax, which is incurred when a resident makes a purchase in another state and uses it within state lines, regardless of whether or not sales tax was paid in another state. This tax is based on an honor system for its residents and is seldom, if ever, paid.   The lowest combined sales tax (statewide and municipality) in Washington is 7.0% in most of Klickitat and Skamania Counties, while the highest combined sales tax in Washington is the aforementioned 9.5% tax on prepared food and beverages in King County.   April 1, 2008 saw tax increases in King County (+.001), Kittitas County (+.003), Mason County (+.001), and the city of Union Gap (+.002) [ 82 ] .   On July 1, 2008, Washington stopped charging an origin-based sales tax, and started charging a destination-based sales tax. This change only applies to transactions beginning and ending within state lines and does not apply to other states. [ 80 ]  Additionally, Washington started collecting taxes from online retailers that have voluntarily agreed to start collecting the sales tax in return for not being sued for back taxes. [ 83 ]   The city of Seattle charges a 7.5% tax on charges for parking garages to go toward mass transit.   On November 4, 2008, voters in King County (Seattle) approved a 0.5% increase in the sales tax. Taxes within the city will increase to 9.5% on retail purchases. This increase was supposed to be effective Jan. 1, 2009 but has been pushed back until April. For the first quarter of 2009 the tax rate in Seattle is 9%.     [ edit ]   West Virginia   West Virginia  has the distinction of being the first US state to enact a sales tax. [ 1 ]  It currently stands at 6%. The sales tax on food currently stands at 3%. Effective  January 1 ,  2006 , the sales tax on food was lowered to 5%, and on  July 1 ,  2007 , it was lowered further to 4%. The sales tax on food was again lowered to 3% on  July 1 ,  2008 . [ 84 ]  However, the reduced rate of tax does not apply to sales, purchases and uses by consumers of prepared food. Prescription drugs are not subject to sales tax. Credit is allowed for sales or use taxes paid to another state with respect to the purchase.   An individual who titles a motor vehicle with the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles must pay a $5.00 title fee and a 5 percent title privilege tax (rather than the 6 percent sales tax). For vehicles purchased new by West Virginia residents, the measure of this tax is the net sales price of the vehicle. For used vehicles, and for vehicles previously titled in other states, the tax is measured by the  National Automobile Dealers Association  book value of the vehicle at the time of registration. No credit is issued for any taxes paid to another state. Trailers, motorboats, all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles are also subject to this tax. [ 85 ]  As of June 7, 2007, new residents of West Virginia no longer have to pay the 5 percent title privilege tax on vehicles, as long as the vehicles were validly titled to the same owner outside the state. [ 86 ]     [ edit ]   Wisconsin   Wisconsin  has a 5% state sales tax, with most of the 72 counties charging an extra 0.5% ""County Tax"". Five counties ( Milwaukee ,  Ozaukee ,  Racine ,  Washington ,  Waukesha ) have a 0.1% tax for purchases over $10 that funds the building of  Miller Park  in  Milwaukee .  Brown County  ( Green Bay ) has a 0.5% tax for purchases over $10 which funds the reconstruction of  Lambeau Field . Prescriptions, most non-prepared foods (including meat and dairy), and newspapers are exempt; however over-the-counter medications are not. [ 87 ]     [ edit ]   Wyoming   Wyoming  has a 4% state sales tax, with counties adding an additional 0% to 2%, resulting in a maximum rate of 6%. In addition, resort district areas have the option to impose an additional 1% tax. Food for domestic home consumption is exempt from sales tax.

[ edit ]   Sales tax planning   See also:  Sales tax audit   In the United States, corporate sales tax planning may include the following:     Determination of ways to legally reduce the amount of tax due on a transaction. For instance, how a company structures its invoices can affect the taxability of the entire transaction. Each U.S. state has different rules for applying sales tax. Some states laws are more advantageous to taxpayer for certain types of transactions. If a business operates in several states, choosing the best state to take delivery in can reduce or eliminate sales tax liability. [ 89 ]  In many states an item can become taxable if not separately stated on the invoice.   Review of company purchases to determine which assets may qualify for exemptions. Finding overlooked exemptions often results in significant savings.   Periodic review of procedures relating to Sales & Use Tax data gathering and retention so that proper supporting documentation, including exemption and resale certificates, are available in the event of a State audit.
