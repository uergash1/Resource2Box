Finding a condo or a house to buy in Florida just got easier.  With our help, you can find the house you are looking for at great deals.  While foreclosures are not as cheap as we are led to believe, we can help you find a home at a price that will fit your budget.   These homes are located in gated communities in Florida.  The close proximity to the beach make these houses great to live in if you are looking for a place to relax after years of running the rat race working eight or more hours per day.  You can enjoy the warmth of the sun and the cooling ocean breeze any time you want to if you own a house near the Florida coast.   Find condos or houses that will fit the way you live.  There are available houses which can accommodate a large family and the occasional party.  If you are just starting a family and would want a not too large house, there are available single-storey homes.  You can buy a house and lease it and occupy it when you are ready to retire.  It is a good investment.   Owning these homes not only mean you get to have a great view of the sea.  Being a homeowner also allows you to join clubs in these gated communities.  Joining these clubs lets you use all amenities inside the community including golf courses and tennis courts.  Or you can spend time on their fitness centers or spas.

Grace.  The mineral from this mine has been found to contain substantial amounts of asbestos; over 100,000 tons of it was shipped to Tampa.  The mineral is heated to a very high temperature in order to use it for manufacturing: vermiculite from Libby released asbestos fibers in plants across the country for decades.     Tampas vermiculite processing plant is not the only source of asbestos exposure in the state.  There are a number of chemical plants and power plants that certainly contained asbestos insulation at one time and perhaps still do.  There are military installations and shipyards in Florida, as well as NASAs facility for launching rockets for satellites and the manned spaceflight program.  Florida has an extensive collection of power plants that provide electricity to the state and to the multistate grid in the area.  The state has a wide assortment of potential asbestos contamination sites: as a result, Florida has one of the highest death rates from mesothelioma in the United States.   Here are some of the Florida facilities that may have exposed employees to asbestos:   Tampa Electric Power Plant    Apollo Beach, FL Armour Chemical Plant   Bartow, FL W.R.

As of 2007 Census Bureau estimates, the population was 1,066,113.  [1]  The  county seat  is  Orlando . [ 1 ]   Orange County is led by the six-seat  Board of County Commissioners , headed by the  Mayor of Orange County . Before the approval by voters of a 2004 charter amendment, the position of Mayor was called ""Orange County Chairman"", which became an elected position in 1990. The current Mayor of Orange County is  Richard Crotty .   Although the seat of government is located in a building in Downtown Orlando, the government declared a region of the county as ""Downtown Orange County"" in 2005. The region of largely unincorporated land (portions of the northern fringe are annexed by Orlando) encompasses the southern portions of the  International Drive  and  Universal Boulevard  corridors. The County Government keeps an office in the area at the North/South Building of the  Orange County Convention Center .  [2]   The primary law enforcement body of Orange County is the  Orange County Sheriff's Office . The Sheriff of Orange County, also an elected position, is Jerry Demings.

In 1824, the area to the south of St. Johns County became Mosquito County, and Enterprise was named the County Seat. This massive county took up much of Central Florida. Mosquito County was renamed Orange County in 1845 when Florida became a state. Several counties, such as Osceola, Seminole, and Volusia County, were carved out of Orange County.   Orange County was renamed from Mosquito County for the  fruit  that constituted the county's main product. At its peak in the early 1970s, some 80,000 acres (320 km) were planted in citrus in Orange County. A truly impressive sight while driving through the rolling hills of the region were the vast vistas of the dark green foliage of orange trees and the intoxicating scent of the orange blossoms when in bloom. Today, far fewer commercial orange groves remain. The vast majority of groves were destroyed by the devastating freezing temperatures experienced in several severe winters of the early 1980s. The financial setbacks, (not the first in the history of the grove region), was just too much for many growers and many, economically destroyed, just walked away from the land and its outstanding obligations. Others hung on awaiting any opportunities. One of the major land owners and growers in the region was the Tropicana company. They, however, also threw in the towel rather than try to come back again from these seemingly generational decimations. With no realistic avenues for agricultural utilization of this rural land and Florida's continuing strong population growth and its attendant needs, (not the least of which was aided and abetted by the great success of nearby Disney World and Universal Studios), these areas began and continue to be, swallowed up by growing housing developments. However, several packing facilities and wholesalers are still in Orange County.     [ edit ]   Paved roads   The first paved roads in Orange County, outside the cities, were built in 1915 and 1916 under a $600,000  bond issue , approved by voters on  November 11 ,  1913 . These five roads were paved 9 feet (3 m) wide with brick:     Orlando  south to  Osceola County  via  Edgewood ,  Pine Castle  and  Taft  (later  SR 2 , part of the  Dixie Highway )   Orlando  east and south to  Conway  (later  SR 29 )   Orlando  north to  Seminole County  via  Winter Park  and  Lake Maitland  (later  SR 3 , part of the  Dixie Highway )   Orlando  west to  Oakland  via  Ocoee  and  Winter Garden  (later  SR 22 )   Orlando  northwest to  Apopka  and beyond, probably to  Plymouth  (later  SR 2 , part of the  Dixie Highway )            The roads built and planned in the 1926 bond issue, and earlier paved roads.       In the next ten years, the following roads also received a hard surface:     Conway  south and west to  Pine Castle  (asphalt) (later  SR 29  and  SR 285 )   Orlando  east to  Brevard  via  Bithlo  (brick east to  Lake Barton  and then asphalt) (later  SR 22 )   west of  Bithlo  north to  Seminole County  (brick) (later  SR 203 )   Orlando  east and north to  Winter Park , passing east of  Lake Sue  (asphalt)   Winter Park  northeast to  Seminole County  via  Goldenrod  (asphalt) (later  SR 202 )   Plymouth  northwest to  Lake County  via  Zellwood  (asphalt) (later  SR 2 )   Ocoee  north to  Apopka  (asphalt) (later  SR 24  and  SR 443 )   Oakland  west to  Lake County  (brick) (later  SR 22 )   south two miles (3 km) from  Tildenville  (asphalt) (later  SR 208 )   south 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from  Winter Garden  (asphalt) (later  SR 24 )   north of  Gotha  south to  Windermere  via  Gotha  (asphalt) (later  SR 437 )     Another  bond issue , this time for $7,000,000, was approved by voters on  March 23 ,  1926 . These asphalt roads covered almost all parts of the county; most of them are still main roads. There are too many to list here but a map is available.

Fundamentally, the lack of east-west mobility in the area creates severe traffic issues every weekday.     [ edit ]   Geography   According to the  U.S. Census Bureau , the county has a total area of 1,004 square miles (2,601 km), of which, 907 square miles (2,350 km) of it is land and 97 square miles (251 km) of it (9.63%) is water.

[ edit ]   Urban sprawl   Orange County is experiencing major sprawl; land is being developed at an average of 7,800 acres (32 km 2 ) of farmland per year. The sprawl has facilitated the county's large population growth, and if current trends continue, the county could have a population of 2,500,000 by the year 2050. That is up from 896,000 in the year 2000. Because of such rapid growth, roads have become outdated and are not able to hold enough cars. Growth started around the 1950s and the 1960s. The sprawl has started around 1990s. There are plans for new interstate roads along and crossing I-4 and a new commuter rail line. There are new highways being built now, but has been worked on for about 20-25 years, plans have been constantly revised because of such growth.

The per-cost race then to rent a car from an established car owner was ""$3,000, and a set of tires,"" Schrader said.    Now, unless you have about $15 million in sponsorship money for the season, don't bother.    As it is most everywhere, the economy is the hot topic at the 21st Annual Performance Racing Industry trade show, which runs through Saturday at the Orange County Convention Center. The show, which is not open to the public, is for racers and others involved in the industry.

The conference addresses business and technical issues in the power industry.  On Wednesday, the show's owner, Oklahoma-based PennWell Corp.  projected a total attendance of about 19,000 by the event's close today.  That would be an increase of 9 percent over last year's event, the company said.    The show's exhibition included more than 1,200 companies in one million square feet of exhibit space.      ""These impressive numbers indicate that the power industry is experiencing anything but a recession,"" said Robert Biolchini, president and chief executive officer of PennWell Corp.

The visitors bureau's 2007 tax return shows that former President Bill Peeper earned $744,441 following his Dec. 31, 2006, retirement, thanks to a complex retirement package negotiated with the agency's board of directors in the mid-1990s.    The compensation was on top of the bureau's regular retirement plan and the $416,000 salary that Peeper was paid in 2006, his 23rd and final year as the visitors bureau's chief executive.    Representatives for the visitors bureau, which receives both public and private money, declined to provide copies of Peeper's contracts or discuss their terms, calling them confidential personnel matters.    But Mark McHugh, president of Gatorland and chairman of the agency's board of directors, said the retirement compensation was ""appropriate"" because the nearly $750,000 accumulated over time. McHugh credited Peeper, who was the first chief executive in the bureau's history, for building the agency from a small group of staffers into a major player in global tourism.

""That's my team,"" said Gunter, who was at the National Funeral Directors Association Expo on Tuesday in Orlando, checking outthe baseball-themed and other latest casket offerings from Eternal Image, a Michigan outfit that offers licensed brand-image caskets, urns, monuments and vaults.    Gunter, owner of Gunter Funeral Home and Cremation Services in St. Petersburg, said that while custom coffins are a small slice of the multimillion-dollar burial business, more families these days look for a way to honor their dearly departed in a personal way.    That might mean a scarlet and gray Ohio State Buckeyes casket, a snazzy blue and gray Star Trek coffin, or maybe a nice New York Yankees urn sitting atop a home-plate base.

Organizers of the National Business Aviation Association's annual convention say the show has drawn just a shade fewer than 30,000 industry people this year, with the crowds split between the Orange County Convention Center and Orlando Executive Airport. That's about 3,000 fewer people than the convention attracted last year in Atlanta.    Still, promoters say they are pleased with the turnout considering the hurdles now facing aviation businesses -- from tightening credit markets to unprecedented fuel prices.    ""We're delighted with this level of attendance,"" said Dan Hubbard, a spokesman for the NBAA, which represents more than 8,000 companies. ""I think we recognize that the industry is going through some economic gyrations.""    That's not to say the NBAA's three-day convention, which is primarily for industry professionals and concludes today, is a quiet affair.    More  here .

At the moment, it doesn't look like the economic troubles will cause negative fallout, Ackert said, adding, None of them have expressed any concern about their ability to proceed.  Before anything does proceed, Ackert noted, there needs to be a plan that is approved by the County Commission.    Earlier this year, Orange County officials gave the green light for Universal City Property Management to explore the possibility of building hotels, restaurants and other businesses on public land alongside the Convention Center.  Hilton is already constructing a 1,400 room hotel adjacent to the center, and The Peabody is in the midst of an expansion.                Add a comment    Filed under:  Conventions                          Convention Center creates guest and community relations division        posted by Sara Clarke on Sep 29, 2008 11:03:14 AM      Discuss This:  Comments (0)      |  TrackBack (0)  |  Linking Blogs  |  Add to del.icio.us  |  Digg it                   The Orange County Convention Center announced Friday that it has created a new division focused on guest services and community relations.      The Guest and Community Relations Division will aim to support the facilitys reputation as a Center of Hospitality and to strengthen relationships within the Central Florida community, according to an announcement released by the Convention Center.     The goals of this division have always been priorities at the Convention Center, said Kathie Canning, deputy general manager of the Center, in the announcement. Now, were carving out a group of professionals to focus on this effort and reinforce our commitments to our guests and our community.      Among other things, the division will create new ways for integrating customer feedback and work on a community outreach effort to educate local civic groups about the donations that events at the Center can provide to local non-profit organizations.

And the group used the forum to repeat the tourism industry's longstanding mantra that local hotel taxes should be spent on tourism advertising -- rather than, as some community activists have long argued, on local needs such as roads, schools and cops.     Council member Pat Engfer, the general manager of the Hyatt hotel at Orlando International Airport, said the community should remember ""what the purpose of the tax was"" when it was originally imposed. ""It is to promote tourism, so we can keep our industry healthy, so we can keep our economy healthy,"" she said.    Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty, clearly stung by criticism that his administration is spending more money on tourism ads than on bus service, said the local economy would likely be in worse shape if the county hadn't set aside $46 million this year for marketing. ""I'm pretty proud that we authorized the advertising campaign,"" Crotty said.    Crotty also made sure to note that state law currently restricts how counties can spend the bed tax. But then again, there are often efforts to expand that law, though such efforts are usually snuffed out by tourism industry lobbying.     Aside from the tax talk, the brief meeting offered a glimpse of how things are going at the Orange County Convention Center.     County auditors report that the convention center's operating revenues are up 21.5 percent through the first nine months of its fiscal year to $54.2 million. Its operating expenses, on the other hand, have risen only 9.8 percent to $50.6 million. That means the convention center has churned out operating revenues of $3.6 million so far this year, which is good news because any shortfalls have to be patched with hotel taxes.

clueweb09-enwp01-87-19922	"                     Orange County Convention Center          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 North Concourse of the Orange County Convention Center       The  Orange County Convention Center  (OCCC) is the primary public  convention center  for the  Central Florida  region. The center currently ranks as the second largest convention center in the  United States  (the first is  McCormick Place  in  Chicago ). The center currently offers 7 million ft of total space. The large complex is located on  International Drive , a major tourist area in  Orlando ,  Florida .     [ edit ]   History   Originally the  Orange County Convention and Civic Center  (OCCCC), it was an idea born out of a 1977 law passed by Florida's State Legislature that permits counties to collect a ""Tourist Development Tax"" on top of regular  sales tax  on hotel room stays, with the approval of the county's voters, for state-approved purposes. In April 1978 in a special election, the voters of  Orange County  approved a 2% Tourist Development Tax (the limit set by the state) for the purpose of building a Convention and Civic Center. That August, the  Orange County Board of County Commissioners  (BCC) approved a location for the OCCCC in Orlando Central Park, on International Drive, and drew up plans for a 325,000 sq ft (30,200 m 2 ) gross area (32,800 m) facility. In 1979, Orlando Central Park and the BCC came to a deal whereby the Orlando Central Park would donate land for the initial facility, and give the county an option on 45 acres (180,000 m 2 ) additional for future expansion. Orlando Central Park agreed to commit adjacent lands for hotel and tourist development, with an incentive of one cent per taxed dollar of the TDT each year for 30 years.   Phase I was completed in February 1983 at a cost of $54 million. The  Boston Pops Orchestra  played at the Grand Opening, and 14,000 people attended the Open House.   In June 1984, the BCC exercised its 45-acre (180,000 m 2 ) option for $2 million and began planning Phase II. The TDT was raised to 3% by a State Law in 1986, and groundbreaking occurred in February 1987 on Phase II. It was completed in January 1989, adding 150,000 sq ft (14,000 m 2 ) of exhibition space to increase it to 344,790 sq ft (32,032 m 2 ) of total exhibition space, and adding an additional 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m 2 ) of meeting and support space.   That very month, an additional 1% was permitted for the TDT, increasing it to 4% The BCC approved an additional three phases to the OCCCC (Phases II A , III and IV), and improvements to the  Citrus Bowl , its first non-Convention Center TDT project.   Phase II A , completed in December 1990, added 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m 2 ) more support space, used largely for office space and registration. The next month, planning for Phase III was begun. By December 1992, ""Civic"" was dropped from the name, and the area became the Orange County Convention Center.   Phase III was completed in January 1996, adding 383,400 sq ft (35,620 m 2 ) of exhibition space, at a cost of $219.5 million. Phase IV followed that  August  at a cost of $198.7 million, adding another 367,200 sq ft (34,110 m 2 ) of exhibition space and about 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m 2 ) more meeting space. A retrofit of Phase I, completed in December 1997 at a cost of $32 million, opened up 8,200 sq ft (760 m 2 ) more. By 1998, the OCCC had 1,103,538 sq ft (102,522.0 m 2 ) of exhibition space over a total building space of over 4 million ft.   In June 1998, the BCC got a fifth cent approved for the TDT, partly for a grand Phase V, which would add a total of 3 million ft of space to the OCCC. That  December , they paid  Universal Orlando Resort  $69 million for 239 acres (0.97 km 2 ) of land across International Drive from the original OCCC. The Martinez Convention Center Commission, named after then-Orange County Chairman  Mel Martinez , was created to oversee planning and construction of Phase V.   Ground broke on Phase V in August 2000 after a large convention organizer, Reed Expositions, agreed to move 42 conventions to Orlando into the new phase. It opened one month ahead of schedule in September 2003. Today, the first four phases are referred to as the ""West Building"", and Phase V is referred to as the ""North/South Building"", as it is divided into North and South Exhibition Halls which can be joined to form one large exhibition space or subdivided into four different halls (North A, North B, South A, South B). The North/South Building has over 1.1 million ft of exhibition space. Around the same time, an elevated walkway was built over International Drive connecting the two buildings.   In 2004, OCCC acted as a staging area for relief operations following  Hurricane Charley , and  Frances  and  Jeanne  thereafter. Disruptions to convention operations were minimal, and a feared reduction of convention booking did not occur afterward.   In 2005, a second entrance was finished on the rear side of the West Building (facing  Interstate 4 ), coinciding with the completion of a flyover bridge, permitting traffic to cross from Westwood Blvd. over the  Beachline  to the rear of the West Building.   In 2006, the BCC raised the Tourist Development Tax to six cents. Half of the extra cent will be used to pay off bonds connected to the new  Orlando Events Center , further renovation of the  Citrus Bowl , and a new Performing Arts Center in Orlando.   In 2008, plans to expand the Convention Center to include an entertainment center ""Rivaling Las Vegas"" will be discussed. The addition, if approved, will cost an estimated 1 billion USD and be complete sometime in the near future. In addition, resort projects surrounding the convention center are currently under construction and will connect directly to the facility via elevated pedestrian walkways, a single elevated pedestrian walkway already exists between the North Concourse and West Concourse over  International Drive . Major resort projects surrounding the center include a 1,000+ room  Hilton  resort and a new tower expansion of the existing  Peabody  Orlando resort.

Do You want Elegance, Pizazz, Humor, and Tons of Personality at your event? Do you want the Most Confident, Professional, Motivated, and Highly Requested,  DJ, Entertainment Director,  Wedding Officiate , to Plan, Direct, Coordinate,  and Conduct your event for you? If your answer is yes then you have found the right Disc Jockey, DJ PorkChop is the answer to everything you want in a DJ! IMAGINE!  All the planning is now behind you; You've made the walk down the aisle, proclaimed your love,and exchanged those beautiful gold wedding bands.  Congratulations, you are now husband and wife. Now it's time to kick back, unwind, forget all the stress and let the DJ take over the formalities of the reception. The main reason couples choose a DJ is that the selection of music a DJ can play spans across all ages and tastes. Aside from the music, DJ PorkChop will  also act as  Master of Ceremonies  to help maintain proper flow of the reception. Let us help coordinate reception events like: First Dance, Cutting of the Cake,  Wedding Toast, Tossing of the Bouquet and Garter and the ever Popular $DOLLAR DANCE! Music is the most important and memorable part of the reception. Guests often do not remember the food or how beautiful the wedding cake was, but they will  always remember how great the party or reception was if you choose a Professional DJ.  Let us help to create a Musical Memory that will Last Forever! The Average Wedding budget in the USA has been over $20,000 for several years.  The DJ fee usually accounts for only 2% of the total wedding budget. Our  service will more than pay for itself in Memories and Peace of mind.  Some couples will actually pay more for a Vegetable tray or Cake cutting than they pay for  their DJ. Sadly is it any wonder why many guests don't stay much past the food Serving?  Your guest may not remember the food, flowers, wine and many never  see the Pictures. They will remember the good (or bad) time they had. The Disc Jockey is the person who can make or break your entire event. Take as much time and effort to select your DJ as you did in selecting your Wedding Dress. The DJ will have only one chance to do the show right. There is no  second opportunity to do it over again.  A quality, professional can actually save you money  in the long run. Let us help to ensure the success of your event. We give you what you expect for your event.

It is also the principal city of  Greater Orlando . The Orlando-Kissimmee MSA is Florida's third-largest metropolitan area, behind  Miami  and  Tampa . Orlando is also home to the  University of Central Florida , which is the second largest  university in Florida  in student enrollment and has the 5th  largest enrollment in the nation.   The city is well known for the many tourist attractions in the area, in particular the nearby  Walt Disney World Resort , which is located in  Lake Buena Vista  about 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Orlando city limits via  Interstate 4 . Other notable area attractions include  SeaWorld  and  Universal Orlando Resort . The region sees an estimated 52 million tourists a year. Orlando has the second largest number of hotel rooms in the country (after  Las Vegas, Nevada ), and is one of the busiest American cities for conferences and conventions with the  Orange County Convention Center , the country's second largest in square footage. It is also known for its wide array of golf courses, with numerous courses available for any level of golfer. Despite being several miles away from the main tourist attractions,  Downtown Orlando  is undergoing major redevelopment with a number of residential projects, commercial towers, and major public works projects including the  Orlando Events Center  and the  Dr. P. Phillips Orlando Performing Arts Center .   The city symbol is the fountain of  Lake Eola  and the current mayor is  Buddy Dyer .

It seems, however, that Orlando Reeves (sometimes Rees) operated a  sugar mill  and  plantation  about 30 miles (50 km) to the north at  Spring Garden  in  Volusia County , and pioneer settlers simply found his name carved into a tree and assumed it was a marker for his grave site. They then referred to the area as ""Orlando's grave"" and later simply Orlando. A memorial beside  Lake Eola  designates the spot where the city's namesake fell.   During the  Second Seminole War , the  U.S. Army  established an outpost at Fort Gatlin, a few miles south of the modern downtown, in 1838. But it was quickly abandoned when the war came to an end.   Prior to being known as its current name, Orlando was known as Jernigan, after the first permanent settler, cattleman  Aaron Jernigan , who acquired land along Lake Holden by the terms of the  Armed Occupation Act  of 1842. But most pioneers did not arrive until after the  Third Seminole War  in the 1850s. Most of the early residents made their living by  cattle ranching .   After  Mosquito County  was divided in 1845, Orlando became the county seat of the new Orange County in 1856. It remained a rural backwater during the  Civil War , and suffered greatly during the  Union blockade . The  Reconstruction  Era brought a population explosion, which led to Orlando's incorporation as a town on July 31, 1875, and as a city in 1885. [ 5 ]   The period from 1875 to 1895 is remembered as Orlando's Golden Era, when it became the hub of Florida's  citrus  industry. But the  Great Freeze  in 1894-1895 forced many owners to give up their independent  groves , thus consolidating holdings in the hands of a few ""citrus barons"" who shifted operations south, primarily around  Lake Wales  in  Polk County .          The Wyoming Hotel in c. 1905       There were a couple of notable homesteaders in the area, including the Curry family. Through their property in east Orlando flowed the  Econlockhatchee River , which travelers crossed by  fording . This would be commemorated by the street's name, Curry Ford Road. Also, just south of the airport in the Boggy Creek area was 150 acres (0.61 km 2 ) of property homesteaded in the late 1800s by the Ward family. This property is still owned by the Ward family, and can be seen from flights out of  MCO  southbound immediately on the south side of SR-417.   Orlando, as Florida's largest inland city, became a popular resort during the years between the  Spanish-American War  and  World War I . The city was also host to several SKEET, which serves as the basis for its hospitals today.   In the 1920s, Orlando experienced extensive housing development during the  Florida Land Boom . Land prices soared. During this period several neighborhoods in downtown were constructed, endowing it with many  bungalows . The boom ended when several  hurricanes  hit Florida in the late 20s and by the  Great Depression .   During  World War II , a number of Army personnel were stationed at the Orlando Army Air Base and nearby Pinecastle Army Air Field. Some of these servicemen stayed in Orlando to settle and raise families. In 1956 the aerospace/defense company  Martin Marietta  (now  Lockheed Martin ) established a plant in the city. Orlando AAB and Pinecastle AAF were transferred to the  United States Air Force  in 1947 when it became a separate service and were redesignated as Air Force Bases (AFB). In 1958, Pinecastle AFB was renamed  McCoy Air Force Base  after Colonel Michael N.W. McCoy, a former commander of the 320th Bombardment Wing at the installation, killed in the crash of a  B-47  Stratojet bomber north of Orlando. In the 1960s, the base subsequently became home to the 306th Bombardment Wing of the  Strategic Air Command  (SAC), operating  B-52 Stratofortress  and  KC-135  Stratotanker aircraft, in addition to detachment operations by  EC-121  and  U-2  aircraft.   Orlando is close enough to  Patrick Air Force Base ,  Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , and  Kennedy Space Center  for residents to commute to work from the city's suburbs. It also allows easy access to  Port Canaveral , an important  cruise ship  terminal. Because of its proximity to the  Space Coast  near the  Kennedy Space Center , many high-tech companies have shifted to the Orlando area.          Lucerne Circle in c. 1905       Perhaps the most critical event for Orlando's economy occurred in 1965 when  Walt Disney  announced plans to build  Walt Disney World . Although Disney had considered the regions of  Miami  and  Tampa  for his park, one of the major reasons behind his decision not to locate there was due to  hurricanes  Orlando's inland location, although not free from hurricane damage, exposed it to less threat than coastal regions. The famous vacation resort opened in October 1971, ushering in an explosive population and economic growth for the Orlando metropolitan area, which now encompasses  Orange ,  Seminole ,  Osceola , and  Lake  counties. As a result,  tourism  became the centerpiece of the area's economy. Orlando is consistently ranked as one of the top vacation destinations in the world, and now boasts more  theme parks  and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world.   Another major factor in Orlando's growth occurred in 1962, when the new Orlando Jetport, the precursor of the present day  Orlando International Airport , was built from a portion of the  McCoy Air Force Base . By 1970, four major airlines ( Delta Air Lines ,  National Airlines ,  Eastern Airlines  and  Southern Airways ) were providing scheduled flights.  McCoy Air Force Base  officially closed in 1975, and most of it is now part of the airport. The airport still retains the former Air Force Base airport code ( MCO ).   In addition to  McCoy Air Force Base , Orlando also had a  naval  presence with the establishment of Naval Training Center Orlando on the former Orlando AFB in 1968. The newest of three Naval Training Centers in the United States providing training to recruits, as well as being a base for selected post basic training programs for enlisted personnel, NTC Orlando also conducted nuclear power training for commissioned officers and the base had a prominent presence in the area. In 1993, the  Base Realignment and Closure Commission  ordered that NTC Orlando be closed, along with a companion installation, NTC San Diego. NTC Orlando continued in a diminished capacity until the base closed for good in 1999 with the last graduates of the base's  Naval Nuclear Power School  leaving in December 1998. The former base has been developed into tracts for upscale housing called  Baldwin Park . Other than Reserve and National Guard activities, the Orlando area's remaining military presence is the  Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division /Naval Support Activity Orlando, located just east of the city limits in the Central Florida Research Park. The U.S. Army's Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO-STRI), the  U.S. Marine Corps'  Program Manager for Training Systems (PMTRASYS) and the U.S. Air Force's Agency for Modeling and Simulation are also collocated at that location.          Lake Eola in 1911       The  SunTrust  Center, the tallest building in Orlando at 441 ft (134 m), was built in 1988. The next tallest buildings are the  Orange County Courthouse  (1997, 416 ft (127 m)./127 m), the  Bank of America  Center (Formerly  Barnett  Plaza, 1988, 409 ft (125 m)./123 m), Solaire at the Plaza (2006, 359 ft (109 m)./109 m) and the  Orlando International Airport   ATC  Tower (2002, 346 ft (105 m)./105 m). The VUE at Lake Eola, currently under construction, will become the second-tallest building in Orlando upon completion at 426 ft (130 m) tall, but with 35 stories it will have more stories than the SunTrust Center.  [ 6 ]   [ 7 ]  The  SeaWorld  SkyTower, at 400 ft (122 m) tall, is the tallest tower in Orange County outside Orlando proper. There are also several tall transmission towers in Orange County, the tallest of which is the  WFTV  transmission tower in  Christmas  at 1,617 ft (491.6 m) tall.   In the hurricane season of 2004,  Hurricanes Charley ,  Frances , and  Jeanne  battered the Orlando area, causing widespread damage and  flooding  and impeding tourism to the area.     [ edit ]   Geography     [ edit ]   Topography   Orlando is located at  28321N   812233W  /  28.53361N 81.37583W  /  28.53361; -81.37583  (28.533513, -81.375789). [ 8 ]  According to the  United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 261.5 km (101 mi). 242.2 km (93.5 mi) of it is land and 19.3 km (7.5 mi) of it (7.39%) is water. Orlando is, on average, 106 feet (32 m) above sea level.     [ edit ]   Climate   Orlando has a warm and  humid subtropical climate , and there are two major seasons each year. One of those seasons is hot and rainy, lasting from the break of June until late September (roughly coinciding with the  Atlantic hurricane season ). The other is the dry season (October through May) that brings more moderate temperatures and less frequent rainfall. The area's warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation and its position relatively close to the  Tropic of Cancer , and much of its weather is affected by the movement of the  Gulf Stream .   During the height of Orlando's very humid summer season, temperatures rarely fall below 70 F (21 C), and daytime highs average in the 90s (32-37 C). Although the city rarely records temperatures over 100 F (38 C), extreme humidity can push the  heat index  to over 110 F (45 C). The city's highest recorded temperature is 101 F (39 C), set July 2, 1998. During these months, strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily. These storms are caused by air masses from the  Gulf of Mexico  and the  Atlantic Ocean  colliding over Central Florida. They are highlighted by spectacular  lightning  and can also bring heavy  rainfall  (sometimes several inches per hour) and powerful  winds  as well as occasional damaging  hail .   During the cooler seasons, humidity is lower and temperatures are more moderate, and can fluctuate more readily. Average nighttime lows in January are around 50 F (10 C), and average daytime highs are about 72 F (22 C). Temperatures rarely reach below 32 F (0 C). Because the winter season is dry and rare freezing temperatures occur after cold fronts (and their accompanying precipitation) have passed, Orlando experiences no significant snowfall (only once has measurable snow accumulated since recording began at the airport in 1948). Very rarely the ingredients come together for flurries to occur, commonly  ocean effect snow . The area around Orlando recorded up to 6"" (15 cm) in 1977 during a snowstorm (which partly contributed to the idea of Disney's blizzard Beach Water Park 20 years later). Reports of flurries in the Central Florida area include December 23, 1989, January 24, 2003, November 24th, 2007, and January 3rd, 2008.  [2]   The average annual rainfall in Orlando is 50.1 in. (128 cm), most of it occurring in the period from June to September. The months of October through May are Orlando's driest season. During this period (especially in its later months), there is often a wildfire hazard. During some years, fires have been severe. In 1998, an  El Nio  condition caused an unusually wet January and February, followed by drought throughout the spring and early summer, causing a record wildfire season that created numerous air quality alerts in Orlando.   Orlando has a considerable  hurricane  risk, although it is not as high as it is in  South Florida 's urban corridor or other coastal regions. Since the city is located 42 miles (68 km) inland from the Atlantic and 77 miles (124 km) inland from the Gulf of Mexico, [ 9 ]  hurricanes usually weaken before arriving. Storm surges are not a concern since the region is 100 ft (30 m) above sea level. Despite its location, the city does see strong hurricanes. During the notorious  2004 hurricane season , Orlando was hit by three hurricanes that caused significant damage, with  Hurricane Charley  the worst of these. The city also experienced widespread damage during  Hurricane Donna  in 1960.         Weather averages for Orlando         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Record high F (C)   88  (31)   90  (32)   91  (33)   97  (36)   100  (38)   100  (38)   100  (38)   100  (38)   99  (37)   95  (35)   90  (32)   90  (32)   100  (38)       Average high F (C)   72  (22)   72  (22)   77  (25)   82  (28)   88  (31)   90  (32)   91  (33)   91  (33)   88  (31)   82  (28)   77  (25)   72  (22)   82  (28)       Average low F (C)   50  (10)   50  (10)   54  (12)   61  (16)   66  (19)   70  (21)   72  (22)   72  (22)   72  (22)   64  (18)   55  (13)   50  (10)   61  (16)       Record low F (C)   19  (-7)   27  (-3)   25  (-4)   39  (4)   48  (9)   54  (12)   64  (18)   64  (18)   55  (13)   43  (6)   28  (-2)   19  (-7)   19  (-7)       Precipitation  inches (cm)   2  (5)   2.8  (7)   3.1  (8)   2.4  (6)   2.8  (7)   6.3  (16)   7.1  (18)   7.9  (20)   6.7  (17)   3.5  (9)   1.6  (4)   2  (5)   50.4  (128)       Source: accuweather.com 2008-12-03         [ edit ]   Culture     [ edit ]   Entertainment and performing arts   The  hip hop music  scene,  metal  scene,  rock music  scene,  reggaeton  and  Latino  scene, are all active within the city, which is largely home to the  Florida Breakbeat  movement. Orlando has also been called Hollywood East because of numerous cinematic enterprises in the area. [ 10 ]          The Universal Studios globe       Until recently, Walt Disney Feature Animation operated a studio out of  Disney's Hollywood Studios  at the  Walt Disney World Resort . Feature Animation-Florida was primarily responsible for the films Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, and the early stages of Brother Bear and contributed on various other projects.  Universal Studios 's Soundstage 21 is home to The  TNA Impact  Zone. Nickelodeon Studios, which through the 90s produced hundreds of hours of GAK-filled game shows targeted at children, no longer operates out of Universal Studios Florida. The Florida Film Festival in nearby Maitland is one of the most respected regional film festivals in the country and attracts budding filmmakers from around the world. In addition, the implosion of Orlando's previous City Hall was filmed for the movie  Lethal Weapon 3 . Orlando's indie film scene has been picking back up since Haxan Film's The Blair Witch Project (1999) and a few years later with Charlize Theron winning her Academy Award for Monster (2003). A Florida state film incentive has also helped increase the amount of films being produced in Orlando and the rest of the state.   The Orlando Metropolitan Area is also home to a substantial theatre population. Several professional and semi-professional houses and many community theaters dot the area including  Orlando Shakespeare Theater , Orlando Repertory Theatre (Central Florida's only Professional Theatre for Young Audiences), Orlando Theatre Project, Mad Cow Theatre, Theatre Downtown, The Osceola Center for the Arts, Winter Park Playhouse, Theatre Winter Haven, and IceHouse Theatre. Disney also a cast theater company known as S.T.A.G.E. as well as Encore, a cast choir and orchestra whose annual charity concerts have raised thousands of dollars.   In addition, the  Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre  brings national tours through town on a regular basis. This venue, built in 1926, will be replaced by the  Dr. P. Phillips Orlando Performing Arts Center  in 2012. [ citation needed ]   Each spring, local theaters and downtown venues play host to the  Orlando International Fringe Theater Festival , which draws touring companies from all around the world as well as readings and fully staged productions of new and unknown plays by local artists. Also in the spring, there is The Harriett Lake Festival of New Plays, hosted by Orlando Shakespeare Theater.

The convention center is vital to Orlando's tourist-based economy, hosting lots of visitors every year.       A large part of the Orlando area economy is involved in the tourist industry. Over 48 million visitors came to the Orlando region in 2004. The convention industry is also critical to the region's economy. The  Orange County Convention Center , expanded in 2004 to over two million square feet (200,000 m) of exhibition space, is now the second-largest convention complex in terms of space in the United States, trailing only  McCormick Place  in  Chicago . The city vies with Chicago and  Las Vegas  for hosting the most convention attendees in the United States. [ 12 ]   Lockheed-Martin  has a large manufacturing facility for missile systems, aeronautical craft and related high tech research. Other notable engineering firms have offices or labs in the Central Florida area:  KDF ,  General Dynamics ,  Harris ,  Westinghouse ,  Siemens ,  Veritas / Seagate , multiple  USAF  facilities, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division ( NAWCTSD ),  Delta Connection  Academy,  Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University ,  GE , Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation ( AFAMS ), Army Simulation Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM), U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI),  AT&T ,  Boeing , CAE Systems Flight & Simulation Training,  HP , Institute for Simulation and Training,  Northrop Grumman ,  Raytheon  Systems. The Naval Training Center until a few years ago was one of the two places where nuclear engineers were trained for the  US Navy . Now the land has been converted into the  Baldwin Park  development.   Another developing sector is the film, television, and electronic gaming industries, aided by the presence of  Universal Studios ,  Disney's Hollywood Studios ,  Full Sail  School, the  Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy , and other entertainment companies and schools. Numerous office complexes for large corporations have popped up along the  Interstate 4  corridor north of Orlando, especially in  Maitland ,  Lake Mary  and  Heathrow . The U.S.  modeling, simulation, and training  (MS&T) industry is centered around the Orlando region as well, with a particularly strong presence in the  Central Florida Research Park  adjacent to  UCF .   Orlando is the home base of  Darden Restaurants , the parent company of  Red Lobster  and  Olive Garden  and the largest operator of restaurants in the world by revenue. They are building a new world headquarters and central distribution facility on John Young Parkway.

Originally Tiburon Entertainment, it was acquired by EA in 1998 after years of partnership, particularly in the famous  Madden NFL  series and  NCAA Football series  of video games.   Orlando has two non-profit hospital systems:  Orlando Health  and  Florida Hospital . Orlando Health's  Orlando Regional Medical Center  is home to Central Florida's only Level I  trauma center , and the adjacent  Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies  has the area's only Level 3  neonatal intensive care unit . Florida Hospital's main campus is ranked as one of the best hospitals in the nation, and has a renowned  brain attack  facility. [ citation needed ]  Orlando's medical leadership will be further advanced with the completion of  UCF 's College of Medicine and a new  VA Hospital , both of which will be located in a new medical district in the Lake Nona area of the city.  [ 13 ]   There is a very low unemployment rate in Greater Orlando, 3.1% as of March 2007. [ 14 ]  The result is growth that has led to  urban sprawl  in the surrounding area and, in combination with the  2007 Subprime mortgage financial crisis , to the rising cost of home prices. Housing prices in Greater Orlando went up 34% in one year, from an average of $182,000 in August 2004 to $245,000 in August 2005, and eventually to a record $255,000 in February 2007. They are tapering off, however, down to $211,000 in April 2008.

The airport was ranked by passengers as the #1 airport in the nation according to  J.D. Power & Associates . The airport features 2 terminals with radiating air-side terminals, flyers are transported via elevated trams. The airport also houses an on-site Hyatt Regency hotel.   The  Orlando Sanford International Airport  (SFB) located in Sanford, FL (far northern suburb) serves as a secondary airport, mainly for European discount carriers.   The  Orlando Executive Airport  located near Downtown Orlando serves primarily executive jets, flight training schools, and general small-aircraft aviation.       [ edit ]   Roads     [ edit ]   Major highways       Interstate 4  is Orlando's primary highway. The interstate begins in  Daytona Beach  and travels across the mid-section of the state directly through Orlando ending in  Tampa . As a key connector to Orlando's suburbs, downtown, area attractions, and both coasts; I-4 commonly experiences heavy traffic and congestion. I-4 is also known as State Road 400.     East-West Expressway  (Toll 408) is a major highway managed by the  Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority . The highway intersects with I-4 in  Downtown Orlando  providing a key artery for residents commuting from eastern and western suburbs including the  University of Central Florida  area. The highway also intersects with the  Central Florida Greeneway  (Toll 417) and  Florida's Turnpike . In late 2006 the I-4/408 interchange finished undergoing a major overhaul that created multiple fly-over bridges and connectors to ease heavy traffic flows. In addition, lane expansions, new toll plazas, and sound barriers are being added throughout the highway.     Beachline Expressway  (Toll 528) provides key access to the  Orlando International Airport  and serves as a gateway to the Atlantic coast, specifically  Cocoa Beach  and Cape Canaveral.     Central Florida Greeneway  (Toll 417) is a key highway for East Orlando, the highway is also managed by the  Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority  and serves as Orlando's eastern beltway. The highway intersects with the  East-West Expressway  (Toll 408), the  Beachline Expressway  (Toll 528), and begins and ends on Interstate 4. The highway is often praised for its green scenery and generally light traffic, however, recently the highway has seen a rapid rise in drivers during rush hours.     Florida's Turnpike  (Toll 91) is a major highway that connects northern Florida with Orlando and Miami. It is the gateway to Miami.     Daniel Webster Western Beltway  (Toll 429) serves as Orlando's western beltway. The highway serves as a new ""back entrance"" to Walt Disney World from Orlando's northwestern suburbs including Apopka.       [ edit ]   Rush hours and traffic   According to a recent national study by the Texas Transportation Institute; the average Orlando Resident spends about 54 hours per year stuck in traffic. Heavy traffic is unpredictable, however, rush hours (peak traffic hours) are usually weekday mornings (after 7am) and afternoons (after 4pm). There are various traffic advisory resources available for commuters including dialing  5-1-1  (a free automated traffic advisory system provided by the  Florida Department of Transportation , available by cellphone or landline by dialing 511), visiting the Florida 511 Web site, listening to traffic reports on major radio stations, and reading electronic traffic advisory displays (also called Dynamic Message Signs, information is also provided by FDOT) on the major highways and roadways.   The Orlando Regional Traffic Management Center (or Orlando RTMC for short) serves as the central hub for traffic operations in the region. It monitors traffic conditions on  Interstate 4 ,  Interstate 95 , The  OOCEA  Toll Roads, and other major surface streets throughout the DOT's District 5 and relays the information to motorists through the use of Dynamic Message Signs and the Florida  5-1-1  system.   There is also a free roadside assistance service on Interstate 4 provided by  Lynx (transportation)  called I-4 Road Rangers. These road rangers patrol during the weekdays looking to help stranded motorists who are in need of tire changing, a tow, or gas. Road Rangers also assist in debris removal on highways and traffic diversion during vehicle crashes. These trucks are highly identifiable by the red/white stripe down the sides ""FREE SERVICE"" decals on the sides and the Florida Department of Transportation Seal on the sides of the truck. Each truck is also equipped with large light up message board on its roof, usually displaying an arrow or urgent message. The toll roads have a similar service provided through OOCEA which is funded on toll fares.   Florida's Turnpike Enterprise  operates its own separate Road Ranger program. Road rangers from I-4 or the OOCEA Toll Road network will not respond to motorists on  State Road 91  otherwise known as  Florida's Turnpike .     [ edit ]   Rail   The Orlando area is served by one through railroad,  CSX Transportation 's A line (formerly the  Atlantic Coast Line Railroad 's main line), and some spurs, mostly operated by the  Florida Central Railroad .  Amtrak  passenger service runs along the CSX A line. See also  a map of these railroads .   The following major railroad stations have existed in Orlando:     Amtrak Orlando station  (originally built by ACL to replace Church Street Station, the only one still in use)   Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Orlando station  (now Church Street Station, a tourist attraction)   Seaboard Air Line Railroad Orlando station  (Central Avenue Station)       [ edit ]   Rail transit   In 2005, Federal and state funding was granted for the establishment of  SunRail , a local  commuter rail  service, to operate on the CSX A line tracks between DeLand and Poinciana, passing through the downtown area and surrounding urban neighborhoods along the way. The service is expected to substantially reduce traffic congestion along the I-4 corridor, especially between downtown Orlando and the suburban communities in Seminole and Volusia Counties. The Federal and state funds would cover approximately 80% of the estimated $400 million cost for track modifications and construction of stations along the route. The counties involved approved local matching funds in 2007, and the line is projected to begin operations in 2011. [ 25 ]   Attempts to study a  light rail  service for the Orlando area have met with resistance in the past. Orlando was also considered a focus of the  Florida High Speed Rail  system, which was mandated by state referendum in 2000 but repealed in 2004.     [ edit ]   Bus     [ edit ]   Regional   Orlando is served by  LYNX ; it provides local transit service covering a five-county area:  Orange ,  Seminole ,  Osceola ,  Lake , and  Volusia . [ 26 ]  Bus route schedules and maps can be found at  LYNX Official Website .     [ edit ]   National   Additionally,  Greyhound Lines  offers intercity bus service from Orlando to multiple locations across the country. The Orlando Greyhound Station is located west of Downtown Orlando.     [ edit ]   Crime   In 2006, based on the Department of Justice's FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division, Orlando reported 4,300 violent crimes including 49 murders, [ 27 ]  a record number since 36 in 1982. Crime in Orlando has been up 329% since 2006. Based on the  Morgan Quitno  Press ""Safest and Most Dangerous Cities of 2007"" rankings, Orlando ranks as the eleventh most dangerous city nationally.   Crime is being attacked by Orlando authorities with the installation of security cameras in Orlando. Traffic lights are merged with cameras cabable of detecting out of ordinary activity. Once a smart camera detects this activity it will zoom in on people of interest in an effort to identify them. It can also zoom in on a license plate.

It is also the principal city of  Greater Orlando . The Orlando-Kissimmee MSA is Florida's third-largest metropolitan area, behind  Miami  and  Tampa . Orlando is also home to the  University of Central Florida , which is the second largest  university in Florida  in student enrollment and has the 5th  largest enrollment in the nation.   The city is well known for the many tourist attractions in the area, in particular the nearby  Walt Disney World Resort , which is located in  Lake Buena Vista  about 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Orlando city limits via  Interstate 4 . Other notable area attractions include  SeaWorld  and  Universal Orlando Resort . The region sees an estimated 52 million tourists a year. Orlando has the second largest number of hotel rooms in the country (after  Las Vegas, Nevada ), and is one of the busiest American cities for conferences and conventions with the  Orange County Convention Center , the country's second largest in square footage. It is also known for its wide array of golf courses, with numerous courses available for any level of golfer. Despite being several miles away from the main tourist attractions,  Downtown Orlando  is undergoing major redevelopment with a number of residential projects, commercial towers, and major public works projects including the  Orlando Events Center  and the  Dr. P. Phillips Orlando Performing Arts Center .   The city symbol is the fountain of  Lake Eola  and the current mayor is  Buddy Dyer .

It seems, however, that Orlando Reeves (sometimes Rees) operated a  sugar mill  and  plantation  about 30 miles (50 km) to the north at  Spring Garden  in  Volusia County , and pioneer settlers simply found his name carved into a tree and assumed it was a marker for his grave site. They then referred to the area as ""Orlando's grave"" and later simply Orlando. A memorial beside  Lake Eola  designates the spot where the city's namesake fell.   During the  Second Seminole War , the  U.S. Army  established an outpost at Fort Gatlin, a few miles south of the modern downtown, in 1838. But it was quickly abandoned when the war came to an end.   Prior to being known as its current name, Orlando was known as Jernigan, after the first permanent settler, cattleman  Aaron Jernigan , who acquired land along Lake Holden by the terms of the  Armed Occupation Act  of 1842. But most pioneers did not arrive until after the  Third Seminole War  in the 1850s. Most of the early residents made their living by  cattle ranching .   After  Mosquito County  was divided in 1845, Orlando became the county seat of the new Orange County in 1856. It remained a rural backwater during the  Civil War , and suffered greatly during the  Union blockade . The  Reconstruction  Era brought a population explosion, which led to Orlando's incorporation as a town on July 31, 1875, and as a city in 1885. [ 5 ]   The period from 1875 to 1895 is remembered as Orlando's Golden Era, when it became the hub of Florida's  citrus  industry. But the  Great Freeze  in 1894-1895 forced many owners to give up their independent  groves , thus consolidating holdings in the hands of a few ""citrus barons"" who shifted operations south, primarily around  Lake Wales  in  Polk County .          The Wyoming Hotel in c. 1905       There were a couple of notable homesteaders in the area, including the Curry family. Through their property in east Orlando flowed the  Econlockhatchee River , which travelers crossed by  fording . This would be commemorated by the street's name, Curry Ford Road. Also, just south of the airport in the Boggy Creek area was 150 acres (0.61 km 2 ) of property homesteaded in the late 1800s by the Ward family. This property is still owned by the Ward family, and can be seen from flights out of  MCO  southbound immediately on the south side of SR-417.   Orlando, as Florida's largest inland city, became a popular resort during the years between the  Spanish-American War  and  World War I . The city was also host to several SKEET, which serves as the basis for its hospitals today.   In the 1920s, Orlando experienced extensive housing development during the  Florida Land Boom . Land prices soared. During this period several neighborhoods in downtown were constructed, endowing it with many  bungalows . The boom ended when several  hurricanes  hit Florida in the late 20s and by the  Great Depression .   During  World War II , a number of Army personnel were stationed at the Orlando Army Air Base and nearby Pinecastle Army Air Field. Some of these servicemen stayed in Orlando to settle and raise families. In 1956 the aerospace/defense company  Martin Marietta  (now  Lockheed Martin ) established a plant in the city. Orlando AAB and Pinecastle AAF were transferred to the  United States Air Force  in 1947 when it became a separate service and were redesignated as Air Force Bases (AFB). In 1958, Pinecastle AFB was renamed  McCoy Air Force Base  after Colonel Michael N.W. McCoy, a former commander of the 320th Bombardment Wing at the installation, killed in the crash of a  B-47  Stratojet bomber north of Orlando. In the 1960s, the base subsequently became home to the 306th Bombardment Wing of the  Strategic Air Command  (SAC), operating  B-52 Stratofortress  and  KC-135  Stratotanker aircraft, in addition to detachment operations by  EC-121  and  U-2  aircraft.   Orlando is close enough to  Patrick Air Force Base ,  Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , and  Kennedy Space Center  for residents to commute to work from the city's suburbs. It also allows easy access to  Port Canaveral , an important  cruise ship  terminal. Because of its proximity to the  Space Coast  near the  Kennedy Space Center , many high-tech companies have shifted to the Orlando area.          Lucerne Circle in c. 1905       Perhaps the most critical event for Orlando's economy occurred in 1965 when  Walt Disney  announced plans to build  Walt Disney World . Although Disney had considered the regions of  Miami  and  Tampa  for his park, one of the major reasons behind his decision not to locate there was due to  hurricanes  Orlando's inland location, although not free from hurricane damage, exposed it to less threat than coastal regions. The famous vacation resort opened in October 1971, ushering in an explosive population and economic growth for the Orlando metropolitan area, which now encompasses  Orange ,  Seminole ,  Osceola , and  Lake  counties. As a result,  tourism  became the centerpiece of the area's economy. Orlando is consistently ranked as one of the top vacation destinations in the world, and now boasts more  theme parks  and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world.   Another major factor in Orlando's growth occurred in 1962, when the new Orlando Jetport, the precursor of the present day  Orlando International Airport , was built from a portion of the  McCoy Air Force Base . By 1970, four major airlines ( Delta Air Lines ,  National Airlines ,  Eastern Airlines  and  Southern Airways ) were providing scheduled flights.  McCoy Air Force Base  officially closed in 1975, and most of it is now part of the airport. The airport still retains the former Air Force Base airport code ( MCO ).   In addition to  McCoy Air Force Base , Orlando also had a  naval  presence with the establishment of Naval Training Center Orlando on the former Orlando AFB in 1968. The newest of three Naval Training Centers in the United States providing training to recruits, as well as being a base for selected post basic training programs for enlisted personnel, NTC Orlando also conducted nuclear power training for commissioned officers and the base had a prominent presence in the area. In 1993, the  Base Realignment and Closure Commission  ordered that NTC Orlando be closed, along with a companion installation, NTC San Diego. NTC Orlando continued in a diminished capacity until the base closed for good in 1999 with the last graduates of the base's  Naval Nuclear Power School  leaving in December 1998. The former base has been developed into tracts for upscale housing called  Baldwin Park . Other than Reserve and National Guard activities, the Orlando area's remaining military presence is the  Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division /Naval Support Activity Orlando, located just east of the city limits in the Central Florida Research Park. The U.S. Army's Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO-STRI), the  U.S. Marine Corps'  Program Manager for Training Systems (PMTRASYS) and the U.S. Air Force's Agency for Modeling and Simulation are also collocated at that location.          Lake Eola in 1911       The  SunTrust  Center, the tallest building in Orlando at 441 ft (134 m), was built in 1988. The next tallest buildings are the  Orange County Courthouse  (1997, 416 ft (127 m)./127 m), the  Bank of America  Center (Formerly  Barnett  Plaza, 1988, 409 ft (125 m)./123 m), Solaire at the Plaza (2006, 359 ft (109 m)./109 m) and the  Orlando International Airport   ATC  Tower (2002, 346 ft (105 m)./105 m). The VUE at Lake Eola, currently under construction, will become the second-tallest building in Orlando upon completion at 426 ft (130 m) tall, but with 35 stories it will have more stories than the SunTrust Center.  [ 6 ]   [ 7 ]  The  SeaWorld  SkyTower, at 400 ft (122 m) tall, is the tallest tower in Orange County outside Orlando proper. There are also several tall transmission towers in Orange County, the tallest of which is the  WFTV  transmission tower in  Christmas  at 1,617 ft (491.6 m) tall.   In the hurricane season of 2004,  Hurricanes Charley ,  Frances , and  Jeanne  battered the Orlando area, causing widespread damage and  flooding  and impeding tourism to the area.     [ edit ]   Geography     [ edit ]   Topography   Orlando is located at  28321N   812233W  /  28.53361N 81.37583W  /  28.53361; -81.37583  (28.533513, -81.375789). [ 8 ]  According to the  United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 261.5 km (101 mi). 242.2 km (93.5 mi) of it is land and 19.3 km (7.5 mi) of it (7.39%) is water. Orlando is, on average, 106 feet (32 m) above sea level.     [ edit ]   Climate   Orlando has a warm and  humid subtropical climate , and there are two major seasons each year. One of those seasons is hot and rainy, lasting from the break of June until late September (roughly coinciding with the  Atlantic hurricane season ). The other is the dry season (October through May) that brings more moderate temperatures and less frequent rainfall. The area's warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation and its position relatively close to the  Tropic of Cancer , and much of its weather is affected by the movement of the  Gulf Stream .   During the height of Orlando's very humid summer season, temperatures rarely fall below 70 F (21 C), and daytime highs average in the 90s (32-37 C). Although the city rarely records temperatures over 100 F (38 C), extreme humidity can push the  heat index  to over 110 F (45 C). The city's highest recorded temperature is 101 F (39 C), set July 2, 1998. During these months, strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily. These storms are caused by air masses from the  Gulf of Mexico  and the  Atlantic Ocean  colliding over Central Florida. They are highlighted by spectacular  lightning  and can also bring heavy  rainfall  (sometimes several inches per hour) and powerful  winds  as well as occasional damaging  hail .   During the cooler seasons, humidity is lower and temperatures are more moderate, and can fluctuate more readily. Average nighttime lows in January are around 50 F (10 C), and average daytime highs are about 72 F (22 C). Temperatures rarely reach below 32 F (0 C). Because the winter season is dry and rare freezing temperatures occur after cold fronts (and their accompanying precipitation) have passed, Orlando experiences no significant snowfall (only once has measurable snow accumulated since recording began at the airport in 1948). Very rarely the ingredients come together for flurries to occur, commonly  ocean effect snow . The area around Orlando recorded up to 6"" (15 cm) in 1977 during a snowstorm (which partly contributed to the idea of Disney's blizzard Beach Water Park 20 years later). Reports of flurries in the Central Florida area include December 23, 1989, January 24, 2003, November 24th, 2007, and January 3rd, 2008.  [2]   The average annual rainfall in Orlando is 50.1 in. (128 cm), most of it occurring in the period from June to September. The months of October through May are Orlando's driest season. During this period (especially in its later months), there is often a wildfire hazard. During some years, fires have been severe. In 1998, an  El Nio  condition caused an unusually wet January and February, followed by drought throughout the spring and early summer, causing a record wildfire season that created numerous air quality alerts in Orlando.   Orlando has a considerable  hurricane  risk, although it is not as high as it is in  South Florida 's urban corridor or other coastal regions. Since the city is located 42 miles (68 km) inland from the Atlantic and 77 miles (124 km) inland from the Gulf of Mexico, [ 9 ]  hurricanes usually weaken before arriving. Storm surges are not a concern since the region is 100 ft (30 m) above sea level. Despite its location, the city does see strong hurricanes. During the notorious  2004 hurricane season , Orlando was hit by three hurricanes that caused significant damage, with  Hurricane Charley  the worst of these. The city also experienced widespread damage during  Hurricane Donna  in 1960.         Weather averages for Orlando         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Record high F (C)   88  (31)   90  (32)   91  (33)   97  (36)   100  (38)   100  (38)   100  (38)   100  (38)   99  (37)   95  (35)   90  (32)   90  (32)   100  (38)       Average high F (C)   72  (22)   72  (22)   77  (25)   82  (28)   88  (31)   90  (32)   91  (33)   91  (33)   88  (31)   82  (28)   77  (25)   72  (22)   82  (28)       Average low F (C)   50  (10)   50  (10)   54  (12)   61  (16)   66  (19)   70  (21)   72  (22)   72  (22)   72  (22)   64  (18)   55  (13)   50  (10)   61  (16)       Record low F (C)   19  (-7)   27  (-3)   25  (-4)   39  (4)   48  (9)   54  (12)   64  (18)   64  (18)   55  (13)   43  (6)   28  (-2)   19  (-7)   19  (-7)       Precipitation  inches (cm)   2  (5)   2.8  (7)   3.1  (8)   2.4  (6)   2.8  (7)   6.3  (16)   7.1  (18)   7.9  (20)   6.7  (17)   3.5  (9)   1.6  (4)   2  (5)   50.4  (128)       Source: accuweather.com 2008-12-03         [ edit ]   Culture     [ edit ]   Entertainment and performing arts   The  hip hop music  scene,  metal  scene,  rock music  scene,  reggaeton  and  Latino  scene, are all active within the city, which is largely home to the  Florida Breakbeat  movement. Orlando has also been called Hollywood East because of numerous cinematic enterprises in the area. [ 10 ]          The Universal Studios globe       Until recently, Walt Disney Feature Animation operated a studio out of  Disney's Hollywood Studios  at the  Walt Disney World Resort . Feature Animation-Florida was primarily responsible for the films Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, and the early stages of Brother Bear and contributed on various other projects.  Universal Studios 's Soundstage 21 is home to The  TNA Impact  Zone. Nickelodeon Studios, which through the 90s produced hundreds of hours of GAK-filled game shows targeted at children, no longer operates out of Universal Studios Florida. The Florida Film Festival in nearby Maitland is one of the most respected regional film festivals in the country and attracts budding filmmakers from around the world. In addition, the implosion of Orlando's previous City Hall was filmed for the movie  Lethal Weapon 3 . Orlando's indie film scene has been picking back up since Haxan Film's The Blair Witch Project (1999) and a few years later with Charlize Theron winning her Academy Award for Monster (2003). A Florida state film incentive has also helped increase the amount of films being produced in Orlando and the rest of the state.   The Orlando Metropolitan Area is also home to a substantial theatre population. Several professional and semi-professional houses and many community theaters dot the area including  Orlando Shakespeare Theater , Orlando Repertory Theatre (Central Florida's only Professional Theatre for Young Audiences), Orlando Theatre Project, Mad Cow Theatre, Theatre Downtown, The Osceola Center for the Arts, Winter Park Playhouse, Theatre Winter Haven, and IceHouse Theatre. Disney also a cast theater company known as S.T.A.G.E. as well as Encore, a cast choir and orchestra whose annual charity concerts have raised thousands of dollars.   In addition, the  Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre  brings national tours through town on a regular basis. This venue, built in 1926, will be replaced by the  Dr. P. Phillips Orlando Performing Arts Center  in 2012. [ citation needed ]   Each spring, local theaters and downtown venues play host to the  Orlando International Fringe Theater Festival , which draws touring companies from all around the world as well as readings and fully staged productions of new and unknown plays by local artists.

The U.S.  modeling, simulation, and training  (MS&T) industry is centered around the Orlando region as well, with a particularly strong presence in the  Central Florida Research Park  adjacent to  UCF .   Orlando is the home base of  Darden Restaurants , the parent company of  Red Lobster  and  Olive Garden  and the largest operator of restaurants in the world by revenue. They are building a new world headquarters and central distribution facility on John Young Parkway. [ citation needed ]   Nearby  Maitland  is the home of Tiburon, a division of the video game company  Electronic Arts . Originally Tiburon Entertainment, it was acquired by EA in 1998 after years of partnership, particularly in the famous  Madden NFL  series and  NCAA Football series  of video games.   Orlando has two non-profit hospital systems:  Orlando Health  and  Florida Hospital . Orlando Health's  Orlando Regional Medical Center  is home to Central Florida's only Level I  trauma center , and the adjacent  Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies  has the area's only Level 3  neonatal intensive care unit . Florida Hospital's main campus is ranked as one of the best hospitals in the nation, and has a renowned  brain attack  facility. [ citation needed ]  Orlando's medical leadership will be further advanced with the completion of  UCF 's College of Medicine and a new  VA Hospital , both of which will be located in a new medical district in the Lake Nona area of the city.  [ 13 ]   There is a very low unemployment rate in Greater Orlando, 3.1% as of March 2007. [ 14 ]  The result is growth that has led to  urban sprawl  in the surrounding area and, in combination with the  2007 Subprime mortgage financial crisis , to the rising cost of home prices. Housing prices in Greater Orlando went up 34% in one year, from an average of $182,000 in August 2004 to $245,000 in August 2005, and eventually to a record $255,000 in February 2007. They are tapering off, however, down to $211,000 in April 2008.

The area encompasses four counties ( Orange ,  Osceola ,  Seminole  and  Lake ), and is currently the  27th-largest metro area  in the United States with a 2007 Census-estimated population of 2,032,496. [ 17 ]   When  Combined Statistical Areas  were instituted in 2000, Orlando was initially joined together with  The Villages, Florida , Micropolitan Statistical Area, to form the Orlando-The Villages, Florida,  Combined Statistical Area . In 2006, the metropolitan areas of  Deltona  ( Volusia County ) and  Palm Coast  ( Flagler County ) were added to create the  Orlando-Deltona-Daytona Beach, Florida, Combined Statistical Area .  [ 18 ]  This new larger CSA carries a total population (as of 2007) of 2,693,552.  [ 19 ] , and carries three of the 25 fastest-growing counties in the nation--Flagler ranks 1st; Osceola, 17th; and Lake, 23rd. [ 20 ]   The metro area is one of the fastest-growing areas in the nation, and the surrounding counties, such as  Polk ,  Brevard  and  Marion , are also seeing high growth rates.

The airport was ranked by passengers as the #1 airport in the nation according to  J.D. Power & Associates . The airport features 2 terminals with radiating air-side terminals, flyers are transported via elevated trams. The airport also houses an on-site Hyatt Regency hotel.   The  Orlando Sanford International Airport  (SFB) located in Sanford, FL (far northern suburb) serves as a secondary airport, mainly for European discount carriers and charters.   The  Orlando Executive Airport  located near Downtown Orlando serves primarily executive jets, flight training schools, and general small-aircraft aviation.       [ edit ]   Roads     [ edit ]   Major highways       Interstate 4  is Orlando's primary highway. The interstate begins in  Daytona Beach  and travels across the mid-section of the state directly through Orlando ending in  Tampa . As a key connector to Orlando's suburbs, downtown, area attractions, and both coasts; I-4 commonly experiences heavy traffic and congestion. I-4 is also known as State Road 400.     East-West Expressway  (Toll 408) is a major highway managed by the  Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority . The highway intersects with I-4 in  Downtown Orlando  providing a key artery for residents commuting from eastern and western suburbs including the  University of Central Florida  area. The highway also intersects with the  Central Florida Greeneway  (Toll 417) and  Florida's Turnpike . In late 2006 the I-4/408 interchange finished undergoing a major overhaul that created multiple fly-over bridges and connectors to ease heavy traffic flows. In addition, lane expansions, new toll plazas, and sound barriers are being added throughout the highway.     Beachline Expressway  (Toll 528) provides key access to the  Orlando International Airport  and serves as a gateway to the Atlantic coast, specifically  Cocoa Beach  and Cape Canaveral.     Central Florida Greeneway  (Toll 417) is a key highway for East Orlando, the highway is also managed by the  Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority  and serves as Orlando's eastern beltway. The highway intersects with the  East-West Expressway  (Toll 408), the  Beachline Expressway  (Toll 528), and begins and ends on Interstate 4. The highway is often praised for its green scenery and generally light traffic, however, recently the highway has seen a rapid rise in drivers during rush hours.     Florida's Turnpike  (Toll 91) is a major highway that connects northern Florida with Orlando and Miami. It is the gateway to Miami.     Daniel Webster Western Beltway  (Toll 429) serves as Orlando's western beltway. The highway serves as a new ""back entrance"" to Walt Disney World from Orlando's northwestern suburbs including Apopka.       [ edit ]   Rush hours and traffic   According to a recent national study by the Texas Transportation Institute; the average Orlando Resident spends about 54 hours per year stuck in traffic. Heavy traffic is unpredictable, however, rush hours (peak traffic hours) are usually weekday mornings (after 7am) and afternoons (after 4pm). There are various traffic advisory resources available for commuters including dialing  5-1-1  (a free automated traffic advisory system provided by the  Florida Department of Transportation , available by cellphone or landline by dialing 511), visiting the Florida 511 Web site, listening to traffic reports on major radio stations, and reading electronic traffic advisory displays (also called Dynamic Message Signs, information is also provided by FDOT) on the major highways and roadways.   The Orlando Regional Traffic Management Center (or Orlando RTMC for short) serves as the central hub for traffic operations in the region. It monitors traffic conditions on  Interstate 4 ,  Interstate 95 , The  OOCEA  Toll Roads, and other major surface streets throughout the DOT's District 5 and relays the information to motorists through the use of Dynamic Message Signs and the Florida  5-1-1  system.   There is also a free roadside assistance service on Interstate 4 provided by  Lynx (transportation)  called I-4 Road Rangers. These road rangers patrol during the weekdays looking to help stranded motorists who are in need of tire changing, a tow, or gas. Road Rangers also assist in debris removal on highways and traffic diversion during vehicle crashes. These trucks are highly identifiable by the red/white stripe down the sides ""FREE SERVICE"" decals on the sides and the Florida Department of Transportation Seal on the sides of the truck. Each truck is also equipped with large light up message board on its roof, usually displaying an arrow or urgent message. The toll roads have a similar service provided through OOCEA which is funded on toll fares.   Florida's Turnpike Enterprise  operates its own separate Road Ranger program. Road rangers from I-4 or the OOCEA Toll Road network will not respond to motorists on  State Road 91  otherwise known as  Florida's Turnpike .     [ edit ]   Rail   The Orlando area is served by one through railroad,  CSX Transportation 's A line (formerly the  Atlantic Coast Line Railroad 's main line), and some spurs, mostly operated by the  Florida Central Railroad .  Amtrak  passenger service runs along the CSX A line. See also  a map of these railroads .   The following major railroad stations have existed in Orlando:     Amtrak Orlando station  (originally built by ACL to replace Church Street Station, the only one still in use)   Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Orlando station  (now Church Street Station, a tourist attraction)   Seaboard Air Line Railroad Orlando station  (Central Avenue Station)       [ edit ]   Rail transit   In 2005, Federal and state funding was granted for the establishment of  SunRail , a local  commuter rail  service, to operate on the CSX A line tracks between DeLand and Poinciana, passing through the downtown area and surrounding urban neighborhoods along the way. The service is expected to substantially reduce traffic congestion along the I-4 corridor, especially between downtown Orlando and the suburban communities in Seminole and Volusia Counties. The Federal and state funds would cover approximately 80% of the estimated $400 million cost for track modifications and construction of stations along the route. The counties involved approved local matching funds in 2007, and the line is projected to begin operations in 2011. [ 25 ]   Attempts to study a  light rail  service for the Orlando area have met with resistance in the past. Orlando was also considered a focus of the  Florida High Speed Rail  system, which was mandated by state referendum in 2000 but repealed in 2004.     [ edit ]   Bus     [ edit ]   Regional   Orlando is served by  LYNX ; it provides local transit service covering a five-county area:  Orange ,  Seminole ,  Osceola ,  Lake , and  Volusia . [ 26 ]  Bus route schedules and maps can be found at  LYNX Official Website .     [ edit ]   National   Additionally,  Greyhound Lines  offers intercity bus service from Orlando to multiple locations across the country. The Orlando Greyhound Station is located west of Downtown Orlando.     [ edit ]   Crime   In 2006, based on the Department of Justice's FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division, Orlando reported 4,300 violent crimes including 49 murders, [ 27 ]  a record number since 36 in 1982. Crime in Orlando has been up 329% since 2006. Based on the  Morgan Quitno  Press ""Safest and Most Dangerous Cities of 2007"" rankings, Orlando ranks as the eleventh most dangerous city nationally.   Crime is being attacked by Orlando authorities with the installation of security cameras in Orlando. Traffic lights are merged with cameras cabable of detecting out of ordinary activity. Once a smart camera detects this activity it will zoom in on people of interest in an effort to identify them. It can also zoom in on a license plate.

The owner must               purchase an RP (real               property) series sticker               from the Department of               Highway Safety and Motor               Vehicles. This is a one-time               purchase under Chapter 320,               Florida Statutes. RP mobile               homes are required to be               assessed by the county               property appraiser, placed               on the real property               assessment roll and taxed               annually as real property.                              2)   Annual               license tax                The owner of               a mobile home who does not               own the lot or land on which               the mobile home is situated               is required to pay the               annual license tax under               Chapter 320, F.S. He must               purchase an MH (mobile home)               series sticker from the               Department of Highway Safety               and Motor Vehicles.                 3)   Assessed               and taxed as tangible               personal property                Mobile homes               that meet the criteria for a               MH series sticker under 2)               above but do not bear a               proper, current sticker are               presumed to be tangible               personal property. Mobile               homes that do not bear the               required current sticker are               required to be assessed by               the county property               appraiser, placed on the               tangible personal property               assessment roll and taxed               annually as tangible               personal property.                Real               Property Q & A                Q.    If               a mobile home owner               permanently affixes his home               to land that he owns, can he               declare the mobile home as               real property and take               advantage of the homestead               exemption?                 A.   Yes;               the taxation of the mobile               home as real property is not               optional, but required.                 Q.    Who               determines the listing of a               mobile home as real               property?                 A.   The               legislature has required the               property appraiser to list               mobile homes as real               property based on the               ownership of the land and               the mobile home and whether               it is tied down and               connected to utilities.                 Q.    If               a mobile home is listed by               the property appraiser as               real property, does the               owner still have to pay the               annual license tax?                 A.   No.               If a mobile home is listed               by the property appraiser as               real property, the owner               pays only the real property               tax and the $3 fee for               issuance of an RP series               sticker.                 Q.    If               a mobile home owner               permanently affixes his               mobile home to land that he               owns with another person,               how will the mobile home be               listed for tax purposes?                                A.   As               a general rule the mobile               home is listed by the               property appraiser as real               property. According to               section 193.075, F.S., with               multiple owners, if the               owner(s) of a mobile home is               a subset of the owner(s) of               the land on which the mobile               home is permanently affixed,               the mobile home is listed               and taxed as ""real               property."" Multiple owners               can individually claim               homestead exemption only on               their proportionate share of               the total value of the               mobile home and land.                 Q.    How               does sales tax apply to the               repairs of mobile homes               classified as real property?                              A.   Sales               tax applies to the repairs               of mobile homes classified               and taxed as real property,               as provided in Rule               12A-1.051, Florida               Administrative Code,               Improvements to Real               Property.

""Not               Real Property"" Q & A                Q.    If               the owner of a mobile home               that does not qualify as               real property receives an               assessment for tangible               personal property tax, can               he or she cancel the               assessment by paying the               previous year's annual               license tax and purchasing               the required MH series               sticker?                 A.   No.               Paying the license tax after               the assessment is made does               not cancel the assessment.               Any mobile home that does               not bear a current MH series               sticker on January 1, is               classified as tangible               personal property and taxed               as such for that year.                 Q.    What               if the mobile home owner               purchased the MH series               sticker but did not have it               properly affixed on January               1?                 A.   The               mobile home owner could               request relief from the               tangible personal property               tax if he or she could               provide proof that the MH               series sticker was purchased               prior to January 1 of the               current tax year.                 Q.    Does               the occasional or isolated               sale exemption apply to               mobile homes classified as               tangible personal property?                              A.   No.               Any transfer of ownership of               a mobile home classified as               tangible personal property               would be subject to sales               and use tax as an occasional               or isolated sale. The               occasional or isolated sale               provision in Rule 12A-1.037,               F.A.C., is not extended to               mobile homes which are               classified as tangible               personal property.                 Q.    Does               sales tax apply to the               repairs of mobile homes               classified as tangible               personal property?                 A.   Yes,               repairs and improvements to               mobile homes classified as               tangible personal property               are subject to sales tax on               the total charge, materials               and labors, as provided in               Rule 12A-1.006, F.A.C.                 Q.    How               does sales tax apply to               appurtenances?                Appurtenances means               furniture, freezers,               refrigerators, drapes, air               conditioner               compressor/condenser units               located outside the mobile               home, or other appurtenance,               which are sold in               conjunction with the mobile               home.                 A.   The               sale of a mobile home in               conjunction with               appurtenances classified as               tangible personal property               by persons or dealers who               hold themselves out as               engaged in the business of               selling mobile homes and               appurtenances is taxable.

It is also the principal city of  Greater Orlando . The Orlando-Kissimmee MSA is Florida's third-largest metropolitan area, behind  Miami  and  Tampa . Orlando is also home to the  University of Central Florida , which is the second largest  university in Florida  in student enrollment and has the 5th  largest enrollment in the nation.   The city is well known for the many tourist attractions in the area, in particular the nearby  Walt Disney World Resort , which is located in  Lake Buena Vista  about 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Orlando city limits via  Interstate 4 . Other notable area attractions include  SeaWorld  and  Universal Orlando Resort . The region sees an estimated 52 million tourists a year. Orlando has the second largest number of hotel rooms in the country (after  Las Vegas, Nevada ), and is one of the busiest American cities for conferences and conventions with the  Orange County Convention Center , the country's second largest in square footage. It is also known for its wide array of golf courses, with numerous courses available for any level of golfer. Despite being several miles away from the main tourist attractions,  Downtown Orlando  is undergoing major redevelopment with a number of residential projects, commercial towers, and major public works projects including the  Orlando Events Center  and the  Dr. P. Phillips Orlando Performing Arts Center .   The city symbol is the fountain of  Lake Eola  and the current mayor is  Buddy Dyer .

It seems, however, that Orlando Reeves (sometimes Rees) operated a  sugar mill  and  plantation  about 30 miles (50 km) to the north at  Spring Garden  in  Volusia County , and pioneer settlers simply found his name carved into a tree and assumed it was a marker for his grave site. They then referred to the area as ""Orlando's grave"" and later simply Orlando. A memorial beside  Lake Eola  designates the spot where the city's namesake fell.   During the  Second Seminole War , the  U.S. Army  established an outpost at Fort Gatlin, a few miles south of the modern downtown, in 1838. But it was quickly abandoned when the war came to an end.   Prior to being known as its current name, Orlando was known as Jernigan, after the first permanent settler, cattleman  Aaron Jernigan , who acquired land along Lake Holden by the terms of the  Armed Occupation Act  of 1842. But most pioneers did not arrive until after the  Third Seminole War  in the 1850s. Most of the early residents made their living by  cattle ranching .   After  Mosquito County  was divided in 1845, Orlando became the county seat of the new Orange County in 1856. It remained a rural backwater during the  Civil War , and suffered greatly during the  Union blockade . The  Reconstruction  Era brought a population explosion, which led to Orlando's incorporation as a town on July 31, 1875, and as a city in 1885. [ 5 ]   The period from 1875 to 1895 is remembered as Orlando's Golden Era, when it became the hub of Florida's  citrus  industry. But the  Great Freeze  in 1894-1895 forced many owners to give up their independent  groves , thus consolidating holdings in the hands of a few ""citrus barons"" who shifted operations south, primarily around  Lake Wales  in  Polk County .          The Wyoming Hotel in c. 1905       There were a couple of notable homesteaders in the area, including the Curry family. Through their property in east Orlando flowed the  Econlockhatchee River , which travelers crossed by  fording . This would be commemorated by the street's name, Curry Ford Road. Also, just south of the airport in the Boggy Creek area was 150 acres (0.61 km 2 ) of property homesteaded in the late 1800s by the Ward family. This property is still owned by the Ward family, and can be seen from flights out of  MCO  southbound immediately on the south side of SR-417.   Orlando, as Florida's largest inland city, became a popular resort during the years between the  Spanish-American War  and  World War I . The city was also host to several SKEET, which serves as the basis for its hospitals today.   In the 1920s, Orlando experienced extensive housing development during the  Florida Land Boom . Land prices soared. During this period several neighborhoods in downtown were constructed, endowing it with many  bungalows . The boom ended when several  hurricanes  hit Florida in the late 20s and by the  Great Depression .   During  World War II , a number of Army personnel were stationed at the Orlando Army Air Base and nearby Pinecastle Army Air Field. Some of these servicemen stayed in Orlando to settle and raise families. In 1956 the aerospace/defense company  Martin Marietta  (now  Lockheed Martin ) established a plant in the city. Orlando AAB and Pinecastle AAF were transferred to the  United States Air Force  in 1947 when it became a separate service and were redesignated as Air Force Bases (AFB). In 1958, Pinecastle AFB was renamed  McCoy Air Force Base  after Colonel Michael N.W. McCoy, a former commander of the 320th Bombardment Wing at the installation, killed in the crash of a  B-47  Stratojet bomber north of Orlando. In the 1960s, the base subsequently became home to the 306th Bombardment Wing of the  Strategic Air Command  (SAC), operating  B-52 Stratofortress  and  KC-135  Stratotanker aircraft, in addition to detachment operations by  EC-121  and  U-2  aircraft.   Orlando is close enough to  Patrick Air Force Base ,  Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , and  Kennedy Space Center  for residents to commute to work from the city's suburbs. It also allows easy access to  Port Canaveral , an important  cruise ship  terminal. Because of its proximity to the  Space Coast  near the  Kennedy Space Center , many high-tech companies have shifted to the Orlando area.          Lucerne Circle in c. 1905       Perhaps the most critical event for Orlando's economy occurred in 1965 when  Walt Disney  announced plans to build  Walt Disney World . Although Disney had considered the regions of  Miami  and  Tampa  for his park, one of the major reasons behind his decision not to locate there was due to  hurricanes  Orlando's inland location, although not free from hurricane damage, exposed it to less threat than coastal regions. The famous vacation resort opened in October 1971, ushering in an explosive population and economic growth for the Orlando metropolitan area, which now encompasses  Orange ,  Seminole ,  Osceola , and  Lake  counties. As a result,  tourism  became the centerpiece of the area's economy. Orlando is consistently ranked as one of the top vacation destinations in the world, and now boasts more  theme parks  and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world.   Another major factor in Orlando's growth occurred in 1962, when the new Orlando Jetport, the precursor of the present day  Orlando International Airport , was built from a portion of the  McCoy Air Force Base . By 1970, four major airlines ( Delta Air Lines ,  National Airlines ,  Eastern Airlines  and  Southern Airways ) were providing scheduled flights.  McCoy Air Force Base  officially closed in 1975, and most of it is now part of the airport. The airport still retains the former Air Force Base airport code ( MCO ).   In addition to  McCoy Air Force Base , Orlando also had a  naval  presence with the establishment of Naval Training Center Orlando on the former Orlando AFB in 1968. The newest of three Naval Training Centers in the United States providing training to recruits, as well as being a base for selected post basic training programs for enlisted personnel, NTC Orlando also conducted nuclear power training for commissioned officers and the base had a prominent presence in the area. In 1993, the  Base Realignment and Closure Commission  ordered that NTC Orlando be closed, along with a companion installation, NTC San Diego. NTC Orlando continued in a diminished capacity until the base closed for good in 1999 with the last graduates of the base's  Naval Nuclear Power School  leaving in December 1998. The former base has been developed into tracts for upscale housing called  Baldwin Park . Other than Reserve and National Guard activities, the Orlando area's remaining military presence is the  Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division /Naval Support Activity Orlando, located just east of the city limits in the Central Florida Research Park. The U.S. Army's Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO-STRI), the  U.S. Marine Corps'  Program Manager for Training Systems (PMTRASYS) and the U.S. Air Force's Agency for Modeling and Simulation are also collocated at that location.          Lake Eola in 1911       The  SunTrust  Center, the tallest building in Orlando at 441 ft (134 m), was built in 1988. The next tallest buildings are the  Orange County Courthouse  (1997, 416 ft (127 m)./127 m), the  Bank of America  Center (Formerly  Barnett  Plaza, 1988, 409 ft (125 m)./123 m), Solaire at the Plaza (2006, 359 ft (109 m)./109 m) and the  Orlando International Airport   ATC  Tower (2002, 346 ft (105 m)./105 m). The VUE at Lake Eola, currently under construction, will become the second-tallest building in Orlando upon completion at 426 ft (130 m) tall, but with 35 stories it will have more stories than the SunTrust Center.  [ 6 ]   [ 7 ]  The  SeaWorld  SkyTower, at 400 ft (122 m) tall, is the tallest tower in Orange County outside Orlando proper. There are also several tall transmission towers in Orange County, the tallest of which is the  WFTV  transmission tower in  Christmas  at 1,617 ft (491.6 m) tall.   In the hurricane season of 2004,  Hurricanes Charley ,  Frances , and  Jeanne  battered the Orlando area, causing widespread damage and  flooding  and impeding tourism to the area.     [ edit ]   Geography     [ edit ]   Topography   Orlando is located at  28321N   812233W  /  28.53361N 81.37583W  /  28.53361; -81.37583  (28.533513, -81.375789). [ 8 ]  According to the  United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 261.5 km (101 mi). 242.2 km (93.5 mi) of it is land and 19.3 km (7.5 mi) of it (7.39%) is water. Orlando is, on average, 106 feet (32 m) above sea level.     [ edit ]   Climate   Orlando has a warm and  humid subtropical climate , and there are two major seasons each year. One of those seasons is hot and rainy, lasting from the break of June until late September (roughly coinciding with the  Atlantic hurricane season ). The other is the dry season (October through May) that brings more moderate temperatures and less frequent rainfall. The area's warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation and its position relatively close to the  Tropic of Cancer , and much of its weather is affected by the movement of the  Gulf Stream .   During the height of Orlando's very humid summer season, temperatures rarely fall below 70 F (21 C), and daytime highs average in the 90s (32-37 C). Although the city rarely records temperatures over 100 F (38 C), extreme humidity can push the  heat index  to over 110 F (45 C). The city's highest recorded temperature is 101 F (39 C), set July 2, 1998. During these months, strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily. These storms are caused by air masses from the  Gulf of Mexico  and the  Atlantic Ocean  colliding over Central Florida. They are highlighted by spectacular  lightning  and can also bring heavy  rainfall  (sometimes several inches per hour) and powerful  winds  as well as occasional damaging  hail .   During the cooler seasons, humidity is lower and temperatures are more moderate, and can fluctuate more readily. Average nighttime lows in January are around 50 F (10 C), and average daytime highs are about 72 F (22 C). Temperatures rarely reach below 32 F (0 C). Because the winter season is dry and rare freezing temperatures occur after cold fronts (and their accompanying precipitation) have passed, Orlando experiences no significant snowfall (only once has measurable snow accumulated since recording began at the airport in 1948). Very rarely the ingredients come together for flurries to occur, commonly  ocean effect snow . The area around Orlando recorded up to 6"" (15 cm) in 1977 during a snowstorm (which partly contributed to the idea of Disney's blizzard Beach Water Park 20 years later). Reports of flurries in the Central Florida area include December 23, 1989, January 24, 2003, November 24th, 2007, and January 3rd, 2008.  [2]   The average annual rainfall in Orlando is 50.1 in. (128 cm), most of it occurring in the period from June to September. The months of October through May are Orlando's driest season. During this period (especially in its later months), there is often a wildfire hazard. During some years, fires have been severe. In 1998, an  El Nio  condition caused an unusually wet January and February, followed by drought throughout the spring and early summer, causing a record wildfire season that created numerous air quality alerts in Orlando.   Orlando has a considerable  hurricane  risk, although it is not as high as it is in  South Florida 's urban corridor or other coastal regions. Since the city is located 42 miles (68 km) inland from the Atlantic and 77 miles (124 km) inland from the Gulf of Mexico, [ 9 ]  hurricanes usually weaken before arriving. Storm surges are not a concern since the region is 100 ft (30 m) above sea level. Despite its location, the city does see strong hurricanes. During the notorious  2004 hurricane season , Orlando was hit by three hurricanes that caused significant damage, with  Hurricane Charley  the worst of these. The city also experienced widespread damage during  Hurricane Donna  in 1960.         Weather averages for Orlando         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Record high F (C)   88  (31)   90  (32)   91  (33)   97  (36)   100  (38)   100  (38)   100  (38)   100  (38)   99  (37)   95  (35)   90  (32)   90  (32)   100  (38)       Average high F (C)   72  (22)   72  (22)   77  (25)   82  (28)   88  (31)   90  (32)   91  (33)   91  (33)   88  (31)   82  (28)   77  (25)   72  (22)   82  (28)       Average low F (C)   50  (10)   50  (10)   54  (12)   61  (16)   66  (19)   70  (21)   72  (22)   72  (22)   72  (22)   64  (18)   55  (13)   50  (10)   61  (16)       Record low F (C)   19  (-7)   27  (-3)   25  (-4)   39  (4)   48  (9)   54  (12)   64  (18)   64  (18)   55  (13)   43  (6)   28  (-2)   19  (-7)   19  (-7)       Precipitation  inches (cm)   2  (5)   2.8  (7)   3.1  (8)   2.4  (6)   2.8  (7)   6.3  (16)   7.1  (18)   7.9  (20)   6.7  (17)   3.5  (9)   1.6  (4)   2  (5)   50.4  (128)       Source: accuweather.com 2008-12-03         [ edit ]   Culture     [ edit ]   Entertainment and performing arts   The  hip hop music  scene,  metal  scene,  rock music  scene,  reggaeton  and  Latino  scene, are all active within the city, which is largely home to the  Florida Breakbeat  movement. Orlando has also been called Hollywood East because of numerous cinematic enterprises in the area. [ 10 ]          The Universal Studios globe       Until recently, Walt Disney Feature Animation operated a studio out of  Disney's Hollywood Studios  at the  Walt Disney World Resort . Feature Animation-Florida was primarily responsible for the films Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, and the early stages of Brother Bear and contributed on various other projects.  Universal Studios 's Soundstage 21 is home to The  TNA Impact  Zone. Nickelodeon Studios, which through the 90s produced hundreds of hours of GAK-filled game shows targeted at children, no longer operates out of Universal Studios Florida.

In addition, lane expansions, new toll plazas, and sound barriers are being added throughout the highway.     Beachline Expressway  (Toll 528) provides key access to the  Orlando International Airport  and serves as a gateway to the Atlantic coast, specifically  Cocoa Beach  and Cape Canaveral.     Central Florida Greeneway  (Toll 417) is a key highway for East Orlando, the highway is also managed by the  Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority  and serves as Orlando's eastern beltway. The highway intersects with the  East-West Expressway  (Toll 408), the  Beachline Expressway  (Toll 528), and begins and ends on Interstate 4. The highway is often praised for its green scenery and generally light traffic, however, recently the highway has seen a rapid rise in drivers during rush hours.     Florida's Turnpike  (Toll 91) is a major highway that connects northern Florida with Orlando and Miami. It is the gateway to Miami.     Daniel Webster Western Beltway  (Toll 429) serves as Orlando's western beltway. The highway serves as a new ""back entrance"" to Walt Disney World from Orlando's northwestern suburbs including Apopka.       [ edit ]   Rush hours and traffic   According to a recent national study by the Texas Transportation Institute; the average Orlando Resident spends about 54 hours per year stuck in traffic. Heavy traffic is unpredictable, however, rush hours (peak traffic hours) are usually weekday mornings (after 7am) and afternoons (after 4pm). There are various traffic advisory resources available for commuters including dialing  5-1-1  (a free automated traffic advisory system provided by the  Florida Department of Transportation , available by cellphone or landline by dialing 511), visiting the Florida 511 Web site, listening to traffic reports on major radio stations, and reading electronic traffic advisory displays (also called Dynamic Message Signs, information is also provided by FDOT) on the major highways and roadways.   The Orlando Regional Traffic Management Center (or Orlando RTMC for short) serves as the central hub for traffic operations in the region. It monitors traffic conditions on  Interstate 4 ,  Interstate 95 , The  OOCEA  Toll Roads, and other major surface streets throughout the DOT's District 5 and relays the information to motorists through the use of Dynamic Message Signs and the Florida  5-1-1  system.   There is also a free roadside assistance service on Interstate 4 provided by  Lynx (transportation)  called I-4 Road Rangers. These road rangers patrol during the weekdays looking to help stranded motorists who are in need of tire changing, a tow, or gas. Road Rangers also assist in debris removal on highways and traffic diversion during vehicle crashes. These trucks are highly identifiable by the red/white stripe down the sides ""FREE SERVICE"" decals on the sides and the Florida Department of Transportation Seal on the sides of the truck. Each truck is also equipped with large light up message board on its roof, usually displaying an arrow or urgent message. The toll roads have a similar service provided through OOCEA which is funded on toll fares.   Florida's Turnpike Enterprise  operates its own separate Road Ranger program. Road rangers from I-4 or the OOCEA Toll Road network will not respond to motorists on  State Road 91  otherwise known as  Florida's Turnpike .     [ edit ]   Rail   The Orlando area is served by one through railroad,  CSX Transportation 's A line (formerly the  Atlantic Coast Line Railroad 's main line), and some spurs, mostly operated by the  Florida Central Railroad .  Amtrak  passenger service runs along the CSX A line. See also  a map of these railroads .   The following major railroad stations have existed in Orlando:     Amtrak Orlando station  (originally built by ACL to replace Church Street Station, the only one still in use)   Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Orlando station  (now Church Street Station, a tourist attraction)   Seaboard Air Line Railroad Orlando station  (Central Avenue Station)       [ edit ]   Rail transit   In 2005 Federal and state funding was granted for the establishment of  SunRail , a local  commuter rail  service, to operate on the CSX A line tracks between DeLand and Poinciana, passing through the downtown area and surrounding urban neighborhoods along the way. The service is expected to substantially reduce traffic congestion along the I-4 corridor, especially between downtown Orlando and the suburban communities in Seminole and Volusia Counties. The Federal and state funds would cover approximately 80% of the estimated $400 million cost for track modifications and construction of stations along the route. The counties involved approved local matching funds in  2007 , and the line is projected to begin operations in 2011. [ 25 ]   Attempts to study a  light rail  service for the Orlando area have met with resistance in the past. Orlando was also considered a focus of the  Florida High Speed Rail  system, which was mandated by state referendum in  2000  but repealed in  2004 .     [ edit ]   Bus     [ edit ]   Regional   Orlando is served by  LYNX ; it provides local transit service covering a five-county area:  Orange ,  Seminole ,  Osceola ,  Lake , and  Volusia . [ 26 ]  Bus route schedules and maps can be found at  LYNX Official Website .     [ edit ]   National   Additionally,  Greyhound Lines  offers intercity bus service from Orlando to multiple locations across the country. The Orlando Greyhound Station is located west of Downtown Orlando.     [ edit ]   Crime   In 2006, based on the Department of Justice's FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division, Orlando reported 4,300 violent crimes including 49 murders, [ 27 ]  a record number since 36 in 1982. Crime in Orlando has been up 329% since 2006. Based on the  Morgan Quitno  Press ""Safest and Most Dangerous Cities of 2007"" rankings, Orlando ranks as the eleventh most dangerous city nationally.   Crime is being attacked by Orlando authorities with the installation of security cameras in Orlando. Traffic lights are merged with cameras cabable of detecting out of ordinary activity. Once a smart camera detects this activity it will zoom in on people of interest in an effort to identify them. It can also zoom in on a license plate.

It is also the principal city of  Greater Orlando . The Orlando-Kissimmee MSA is Florida's third-largest metropolitan area, behind  Miami  and  Tampa . Orlando is also home to the  University of Central Florida , which is the second largest  university in Florida  in student enrollment and has the 5th  largest enrollment in the nation.   The city is well known for the many tourist attractions in the area, in particular the nearby  Walt Disney World Resort , which is located in  Lake Buena Vista  about 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Orlando city limits via  Interstate 4 . Other notable area attractions include  SeaWorld  and  Universal Orlando Resort . The region sees an estimated 52 million tourists a year. Orlando has the second largest number of hotel rooms in the country (after  Las Vegas, Nevada ), and is one of the busiest American cities for conferences and conventions with the  Orange County Convention Center , the country's second largest in square footage. It is also known for its wide array of golf courses, with numerous courses available for any level of golfer. Despite being several miles away from the main tourist attractions,  Downtown Orlando  is undergoing major redevelopment with a number of residential projects, commercial towers, and major public works projects including the  Orlando Events Center  and the  Dr. P. Phillips Orlando Performing Arts Center .   The city symbol is the fountain of  Lake Eola  and the current mayor is  Buddy Dyer .

It seems, however, that Orlando Reeves (sometimes Rees) operated a  sugar mill  and  plantation  about 30 miles (50 km) to the north at  Spring Garden  in  Volusia County , and pioneer settlers simply found his name carved into a tree and assumed it was a marker for his grave site. They then referred to the area as ""Orlando's grave"" and later simply Orlando. A memorial beside  Lake Eola  designates the spot where the city's namesake fell.   During the  Second Seminole War , the  U.S. Army  established an outpost at Fort Gatlin, a few miles south of the modern downtown, in 1838. But it was quickly abandoned when the war came to an end.   Prior to being known as its current name, Orlando was known as Jernigan, after the first permanent settler, cattleman  Aaron Jernigan , who acquired land along Lake Holden by the terms of the  Armed Occupation Act  of 1842. But most pioneers did not arrive until after the  Third Seminole War  in the 1850s. Most of the early residents made their living by  cattle ranching .   After  Mosquito County  was divided in 1845, Orlando became the county seat of the new Orange County in 1856. It remained a rural backwater during the  Civil War , and suffered greatly during the  Union blockade . The  Reconstruction  Era brought a population explosion, which led to Orlando's incorporation as a town on July 31, 1875, and as a city in 1885. [ 5 ]   The period from 1875 to 1895 is remembered as Orlando's Golden Era, when it became the hub of Florida's  citrus  industry. But the  Great Freeze  in 1894-1895 forced many owners to give up their independent  groves , thus consolidating holdings in the hands of a few ""citrus barons"" who shifted operations south, primarily around  Lake Wales  in  Polk County .          The Wyoming Hotel in c. 1905       There were a couple of notable homesteaders in the area, including the Curry family. Through their property in east Orlando flowed the  Econlockhatchee River , which travelers crossed by  fording . This would be commemorated by the street's name, Curry Ford Road. Also, just south of the airport in the Boggy Creek area was 150 acres (0.61 km 2 ) of property homesteaded in the late 1800s by the Ward family. This property is still owned by the Ward family, and can be seen from flights out of  MCO  southbound immediately on the south side of SR-417.   Orlando, as Florida's largest inland city, became a popular resort during the years between the  Spanish-American War  and  World War I . The city was also host to several SKEET, which serves as the basis for its hospitals today.   In the 1920s, Orlando experienced extensive housing development during the  Florida Land Boom . Land prices soared. During this period several neighborhoods in downtown were constructed, endowing it with many  bungalows . The boom ended when several  hurricanes  hit Florida in the late 20s and by the  Great Depression .   During  World War II , a number of Army personnel were stationed at the Orlando Army Air Base and nearby Pinecastle Army Air Field. Some of these servicemen stayed in Orlando to settle and raise families. In 1956 the aerospace/defense company  Martin Marietta  (now  Lockheed Martin ) established a plant in the city. Orlando AAB and Pinecastle AAF were transferred to the  United States Air Force  in 1947 when it became a separate service and were redesignated as Air Force Bases (AFB). In 1958, Pinecastle AFB was renamed  McCoy Air Force Base  after Colonel Michael N.W. McCoy, a former commander of the 320th Bombardment Wing at the installation, killed in the crash of a  B-47  Stratojet bomber north of Orlando. In the 1960s, the base subsequently became home to the 306th Bombardment Wing of the  Strategic Air Command  (SAC), operating  B-52 Stratofortress  and  KC-135  Stratotanker aircraft, in addition to detachment operations by  EC-121  and  U-2  aircraft.   Orlando is close enough to  Patrick Air Force Base ,  Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , and  Kennedy Space Center  for residents to commute to work from the city's suburbs. It also allows easy access to  Port Canaveral , an important  cruise ship  terminal. Because of its proximity to the  Space Coast  near the  Kennedy Space Center , many high-tech companies have shifted to the Orlando area.          Lucerne Circle in c. 1905       Perhaps the most critical event for Orlando's economy occurred in 1965 when  Walt Disney  announced plans to build  Walt Disney World . Although Disney had considered the regions of  Miami  and  Tampa  for his park, one of the major reasons behind his decision not to locate there was due to  hurricanes  Orlando's inland location, although not free from hurricane damage, exposed it to less threat than coastal regions. The famous vacation resort opened in October 1971, ushering in an explosive population and economic growth for the Orlando metropolitan area, which now encompasses  Orange ,  Seminole ,  Osceola , and  Lake  counties. As a result,  tourism  became the centerpiece of the area's economy. Orlando is consistently ranked as one of the top vacation destinations in the world, and now boasts more  theme parks  and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world.   Another major factor in Orlando's growth occurred in 1962, when the new Orlando Jetport, the precursor of the present day  Orlando International Airport , was built from a portion of the  McCoy Air Force Base . By 1970, four major airlines ( Delta Air Lines ,  National Airlines ,  Eastern Airlines  and  Southern Airways ) were providing scheduled flights.  McCoy Air Force Base  officially closed in 1975, and most of it is now part of the airport. The airport still retains the former Air Force Base airport code ( MCO ).   In addition to  McCoy Air Force Base , Orlando also had a  naval  presence with the establishment of Naval Training Center Orlando on the former Orlando AFB in 1968. The newest of three Naval Training Centers in the United States providing training to recruits, as well as being a base for selected post basic training programs for enlisted personnel, NTC Orlando also conducted nuclear power training for commissioned officers and the base had a prominent presence in the area. In 1993, the  Base Realignment and Closure Commission  ordered that NTC Orlando be closed, along with a companion installation, NTC San Diego. NTC Orlando continued in a diminished capacity until the base closed for good in 1999 with the last graduates of the base's  Naval Nuclear Power School  leaving in December 1998. The former base has been developed into tracts for upscale housing called  Baldwin Park . Other than Reserve and National Guard activities, the Orlando area's remaining military presence is the  Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division /Naval Support Activity Orlando, located just east of the city limits in the Central Florida Research Park. The U.S. Army's Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO-STRI), the  U.S. Marine Corps'  Program Manager for Training Systems (PMTRASYS) and the U.S. Air Force's Agency for Modeling and Simulation are also collocated at that location.          Lake Eola in 1911       The  SunTrust  Center, the tallest building in Orlando at 441 ft (134 m), was built in 1988. The next tallest buildings are the  Orange County Courthouse  (1997, 416 ft (127 m)./127 m), the  Bank of America  Center (Formerly  Barnett  Plaza, 1988, 409 ft (125 m)./123 m), Solaire at the Plaza (2006, 359 ft (109 m)./109 m) and the  Orlando International Airport   ATC  Tower (2002, 346 ft (105 m)./105 m). The VUE at Lake Eola, currently under construction, will become the second-tallest building in Orlando upon completion at 426 ft (130 m) tall, but with 35 stories it will have more stories than the SunTrust Center.  [ 6 ]   [ 7 ]  The  SeaWorld  SkyTower, at 400 ft (122 m) tall, is the tallest tower in Orange County outside Orlando proper. There are also several tall transmission towers in Orange County, the tallest of which is the  WFTV  transmission tower in  Christmas  at 1,617 ft (491.6 m) tall.   In the hurricane season of 2004,  Hurricanes Charley ,  Frances , and  Jeanne  battered the Orlando area, causing widespread damage and  flooding  and impeding tourism to the area.     [ edit ]   Geography     [ edit ]   Topography   Orlando is located at  28321N   812233W  /  28.53361N 81.37583W  /  28.53361; -81.37583  (28.533513, -81.375789). [ 8 ]  According to the  United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 261.5 km (101 mi). 242.2 km (93.5 mi) of it is land and 19.3 km (7.5 mi) of it (7.39%) is water. Orlando is, on average, 106 feet (32 m) above sea level.     [ edit ]   Climate   Orlando has a warm and  humid subtropical climate , and there are two major seasons each year. One of those seasons is hot and rainy, lasting from the break of June until late September (roughly coinciding with the  Atlantic hurricane season ). The other is the dry season (October through May) that brings more moderate temperatures and less frequent rainfall. The area's warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation and its position relatively close to the  Tropic of Cancer , and much of its weather is affected by the movement of the  Gulf Stream .   During the height of Orlando's very humid summer season, temperatures rarely fall below 70 F (21 C), and daytime highs average in the 90s (32-37 C). Although the city rarely records temperatures over 100 F (38 C), extreme humidity can push the  heat index  to over 110 F (45 C). The city's highest recorded temperature is 101 F (39 C), set July 2, 1998. During these months, strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily. These storms are caused by air masses from the  Gulf of Mexico  and the  Atlantic Ocean  colliding over Central Florida. They are highlighted by spectacular  lightning  and can also bring heavy  rainfall  (sometimes several inches per hour) and powerful  winds  as well as occasional damaging  hail .   During the cooler seasons, humidity is lower and temperatures are more moderate, and can fluctuate more readily. Average nighttime lows in January are around 50 F (10 C), and average daytime highs are about 72 F (22 C). Temperatures rarely reach below 32 F (0 C). Because the winter season is dry and rare freezing temperatures occur after cold fronts (and their accompanying precipitation) have passed, Orlando experiences no significant snowfall (only once has measurable snow accumulated since recording began at the airport in 1948). Very rarely the ingredients come together for flurries to occur, commonly  ocean effect snow . The area around Orlando recorded up to 6"" (15 cm) in 1977 during a snowstorm (which partly contributed to the idea of Disney's blizzard Beach Water Park 20 years later). Reports of flurries in the Central Florida area include December 23, 1989, January 24, 2003, November 24th, 2007, and January 3rd, 2008.  [2]   The average annual rainfall in Orlando is 50.1 in. (128 cm), most of it occurring in the period from June to September. The months of October through May are Orlando's driest season. During this period (especially in its later months), there is often a wildfire hazard. During some years, fires have been severe. In 1998, an  El Nio  condition caused an unusually wet January and February, followed by drought throughout the spring and early summer, causing a record wildfire season that created numerous air quality alerts in Orlando.   Orlando has a considerable  hurricane  risk, although it is not as high as it is in  South Florida 's urban corridor or other coastal regions. Since the city is located 42 miles (68 km) inland from the Atlantic and 77 miles (124 km) inland from the Gulf of Mexico, [ 9 ]  hurricanes usually weaken before arriving. Storm surges are not a concern since the region is 100 ft (30 m) above sea level. Despite its location, the city does see strong hurricanes. During the notorious  2004 hurricane season , Orlando was hit by three hurricanes that caused significant damage, with  Hurricane Charley  the worst of these. The city also experienced widespread damage during  Hurricane Donna  in 1960.         Weather averages for Orlando         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Record high F (C)   88  (31)   90  (32)   91  (33)   97  (36)   100  (38)   100  (38)   100  (38)   100  (38)   99  (37)   95  (35)   90  (32)   90  (32)   100  (38)       Average high F (C)   72  (22)   72  (22)   77  (25)   82  (28)   88  (31)   90  (32)   91  (33)   91  (33)   88  (31)   82  (28)   77  (25)   72  (22)   82  (28)       Average low F (C)   50  (10)   50  (10)   54  (12)   61  (16)   66  (19)   70  (21)   72  (22)   72  (22)   72  (22)   64  (18)   55  (13)   50  (10)   61  (16)       Record low F (C)   19  (-7)   27  (-3)   25  (-4)   39  (4)   48  (9)   54  (12)   64  (18)   64  (18)   55  (13)   43  (6)   28  (-2)   19  (-7)   19  (-7)       Precipitation  inches (cm)   2  (5)   2.8  (7)   3.1  (8)   2.4  (6)   2.8  (7)   6.3  (16)   7.1  (18)   7.9  (20)   6.7  (17)   3.5  (9)   1.6  (4)   2  (5)   50.4  (128)       Source: accuweather.com 2008-12-03         [ edit ]   Culture     [ edit ]   Entertainment and performing arts   The  hip hop music  scene,  metal  scene,  rock music  scene,  reggaeton  and  Latino  scene, are all active within the city, which is largely home to the  Florida Breakbeat  movement. Orlando has also been called Hollywood East because of numerous cinematic enterprises in the area. [ 10 ]          The Universal Studios globe       Until recently, Walt Disney Feature Animation operated a studio out of  Disney's Hollywood Studios  at the  Walt Disney World Resort . Feature Animation-Florida was primarily responsible for the films Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, and the early stages of Brother Bear and contributed on various other projects.  Universal Studios 's Soundstage 21 is home to The  TNA Impact  Zone. Nickelodeon Studios, which through the 90s produced hundreds of hours of GAK-filled game shows targeted at children, no longer operates out of Universal Studios Florida. The Florida Film Festival in nearby Maitland is one of the most respected regional film festivals in the country and attracts budding filmmakers from around the world. In addition, the implosion of Orlando's previous City Hall was filmed for the movie  Lethal Weapon 3 . Orlando's indie film scene has been picking back up since Haxan Film's The Blair Witch Project (1999) and a few years later with Charlize Theron winning her Academy Award for Monster (2003). A Florida state film incentive has also helped increase the amount of films being produced in Orlando and the rest of the state.   The Orlando Metropolitan Area is also home to a substantial theatre population. Several professional and semi-professional houses and many community theaters dot the area including  Orlando Shakespeare Theater , Orlando Repertory Theatre (Central Florida's only Professional Theatre for Young Audiences), Orlando Theatre Project, Mad Cow Theatre, Theatre Downtown, The Osceola Center for the Arts, Winter Park Playhouse, Theatre Winter Haven, and IceHouse Theatre. Disney also a cast theater company known as S.T.A.G.E. as well as Encore, a cast choir and orchestra whose annual charity concerts have raised thousands of dollars.   In addition, the  Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre  brings national tours through town on a regular basis. This venue, built in 1926, will be replaced by the  Dr. P. Phillips Orlando Performing Arts Center  in 2012. [ citation needed ]   Each spring, local theaters and downtown venues play host to the  Orlando International Fringe Theater Festival , which draws touring companies from all around the world as well as readings and fully staged productions of new and unknown plays by local artists. Also in the spring, there is The Harriett Lake Festival of New Plays, hosted by Orlando Shakespeare Theater.

The convention center is vital to Orlando's tourist-based economy, hosting lots of visitors every year.       A large part of the Orlando area economy is involved in the tourist industry. Over 48 million visitors came to the Orlando region in 2004. The convention industry is also critical to the region's economy. The  Orange County Convention Center , expanded in 2004 to over two million square feet (200,000 m) of exhibition space, is now the second-largest convention complex in terms of space in the United States, trailing only  McCormick Place  in  Chicago . The city vies with Chicago and  Las Vegas  for hosting the most convention attendees in the United States. [ 12 ]   Lockheed-Martin  has a large manufacturing facility for missile systems, aeronautical craft and related high tech research. Other notable engineering firms have offices or labs in the Central Florida area:  KDF ,  General Dynamics ,  Harris ,  Westinghouse ,  Siemens ,  Veritas / Seagate , multiple  USAF  facilities, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division ( NAWCTSD ),  Delta Connection  Academy,  Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University ,  GE , Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation ( AFAMS ), Army Simulation Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM), U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI),  AT&T ,  Boeing , CAE Systems Flight & Simulation Training,  HP , Institute for Simulation and Training,  Northrop Grumman ,  Raytheon  Systems. The Naval Training Center until a few years ago was one of the two places where nuclear engineers were trained for the  US Navy . Now the land has been converted into the  Baldwin Park  development.   Another developing sector is the film, television, and electronic gaming industries, aided by the presence of  Universal Studios ,  Disney's Hollywood Studios ,  Full Sail  School, the  Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy , and other entertainment companies and schools. Numerous office complexes for large corporations have popped up along the  Interstate 4  corridor north of Orlando, especially in  Maitland ,  Lake Mary  and  Heathrow . The U.S.  modeling, simulation, and training  (MS&T) industry is centered around the Orlando region as well, with a particularly strong presence in the  Central Florida Research Park  adjacent to  UCF .   Orlando is the home base of  Darden Restaurants , the parent company of  Red Lobster  and  Olive Garden  and the largest operator of restaurants in the world by revenue. They are building a new world headquarters and central distribution facility on John Young Parkway. [ citation needed ]   Nearby  Maitland  is the home of Tiburon, a division of the video game company  Electronic Arts . Originally Tiburon Entertainment, it was acquired by EA in 1998 after years of partnership, particularly in the famous  Madden NFL  series and  NCAA Football series  of video games.   Orlando has two non-profit hospital systems:  Orlando Health  and  Florida Hospital . Orlando Health's  Orlando Regional Medical Center  is home to Central Florida's only Level I  trauma center , and the adjacent  Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies  has the area's only Level 3  neonatal intensive care unit . Florida Hospital's main campus is ranked as one of the best hospitals in the nation, and has a renowned  brain attack  facility. [ citation needed ]  Orlando's medical leadership will be further advanced with the completion of  UCF 's College of Medicine and a new  VA Hospital , both of which will be located in a new medical district in the Lake Nona area of the city.  [ 13 ]   There is a very low unemployment rate in Greater Orlando, 3.1% as of March 2007. [ 14 ]  The result is growth that has led to  urban sprawl  in the surrounding area and, in combination with the  2007 Subprime mortgage financial crisis , to the rising cost of home prices. Housing prices in Greater Orlando went up 34% in one year, from an average of $182,000 in August 2004 to $245,000 in August 2005, and eventually to a record $255,000 in February 2007. They are tapering off, however, down to $211,000 in April 2008.

[ 17 ]   When  Combined Statistical Areas  were instituted in 2000, Orlando was initially joined together with  The Villages, Florida , Micropolitan Statistical Area, to form the Orlando-The Villages, Florida,  Combined Statistical Area . In 2006, the metropolitan areas of  Deltona  ( Volusia County ) and  Palm Coast  ( Flagler County ) were added to create the  Orlando-Deltona-Daytona Beach, Florida, Combined Statistical Area .  [ 18 ]  This new larger CSA carries a total population (as of 2007) of 2,693,552.  [ 19 ] , and carries three of the 25 fastest-growing counties in the nation--Flagler ranks 1st; Osceola, 17th; and Lake, 23rd. [ 20 ]   The metro area is one of the fastest-growing areas in the nation, and the surrounding counties, such as  Polk ,  Brevard  and  Marion , are also seeing high growth rates.

The airport was ranked by passengers as the #1 airport in the nation according to  J.D. Power & Associates . The airport features 2 terminals with radiating air-side terminals, flyers are transported via elevated trams. The airport also houses an on-site Hyatt Regency hotel.   The  Orlando Sanford International Airport  (SFB) located in Sanford, FL (far northern suburb) serves as a secondary airport, mainly for European discount carriers and charters.   The  Orlando Executive Airport  located near Downtown Orlando serves primarily executive jets, flight training schools, and general small-aircraft aviation.       [ edit ]   Roads     [ edit ]   Major highways       Interstate 4  is Orlando's primary highway. The interstate begins in  Daytona Beach  and travels across the mid-section of the state directly through Orlando ending in  Tampa . As a key connector to Orlando's suburbs, downtown, area attractions, and both coasts; I-4 commonly experiences heavy traffic and congestion. I-4 is also known as State Road 400.     East-West Expressway  (Toll 408) is a major highway managed by the  Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority . The highway intersects with I-4 in  Downtown Orlando  providing a key artery for residents commuting from eastern and western suburbs including the  University of Central Florida  area. The highway also intersects with the  Central Florida Greeneway  (Toll 417) and  Florida's Turnpike . In late 2006 the I-4/408 interchange finished undergoing a major overhaul that created multiple fly-over bridges and connectors to ease heavy traffic flows. In addition, lane expansions, new toll plazas, and sound barriers are being added throughout the highway.     Beachline Expressway  (Toll 528) provides key access to the  Orlando International Airport  and serves as a gateway to the Atlantic coast, specifically  Cocoa Beach  and Cape Canaveral.     Central Florida Greeneway  (Toll 417) is a key highway for East Orlando, the highway is also managed by the  Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority  and serves as Orlando's eastern beltway. The highway intersects with the  East-West Expressway  (Toll 408), the  Beachline Expressway  (Toll 528), and begins and ends on Interstate 4. The highway is often praised for its green scenery and generally light traffic, however, recently the highway has seen a rapid rise in drivers during rush hours.     Florida's Turnpike  (Toll 91) is a major highway that connects northern Florida with Orlando and Miami. It is the gateway to Miami.     Daniel Webster Western Beltway  (Toll 429) serves as Orlando's western beltway. The highway serves as a new ""back entrance"" to Walt Disney World from Orlando's northwestern suburbs including Apopka.       [ edit ]   Rush hours and traffic   According to a recent national study by the Texas Transportation Institute; the average Orlando Resident spends about 54 hours per year stuck in traffic. Heavy traffic is unpredictable, however, rush hours (peak traffic hours) are usually weekday mornings (after 7am) and afternoons (after 4pm). There are various traffic advisory resources available for commuters including dialing  5-1-1  (a free automated traffic advisory system provided by the  Florida Department of Transportation , available by cellphone or landline by dialing 511), visiting the Florida 511 Web site, listening to traffic reports on major radio stations, and reading electronic traffic advisory displays (also called Dynamic Message Signs, information is also provided by FDOT) on the major highways and roadways.   The Orlando Regional Traffic Management Center (or Orlando RTMC for short) serves as the central hub for traffic operations in the region. It monitors traffic conditions on  Interstate 4 ,  Interstate 95 , The  OOCEA  Toll Roads, and other major surface streets throughout the DOT's District 5 and relays the information to motorists through the use of Dynamic Message Signs and the Florida  5-1-1  system.   There is also a free roadside assistance service on Interstate 4 provided by  Lynx (transportation)  called I-4 Road Rangers. These road rangers patrol during the weekdays looking to help stranded motorists who are in need of tire changing, a tow, or gas. Road Rangers also assist in debris removal on highways and traffic diversion during vehicle crashes. These trucks are highly identifiable by the red/white stripe down the sides ""FREE SERVICE"" decals on the sides and the Florida Department of Transportation Seal on the sides of the truck. Each truck is also equipped with large light up message board on its roof, usually displaying an arrow or urgent message. The toll roads have a similar service provided through OOCEA which is funded on toll fares.   Florida's Turnpike Enterprise  operates its own separate Road Ranger program. Road rangers from I-4 or the OOCEA Toll Road network will not respond to motorists on  State Road 91  otherwise known as  Florida's Turnpike .     [ edit ]   Rail   The Orlando area is served by one through railroad,  CSX Transportation 's A line (formerly the  Atlantic Coast Line Railroad 's main line), and some spurs, mostly operated by the  Florida Central Railroad .  Amtrak  passenger service runs along the CSX A line. See also  a map of these railroads .   The following major railroad stations have existed in Orlando:     Amtrak Orlando station  (originally built by ACL to replace Church Street Station, the only one still in use)   Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Orlando station  (now Church Street Station, a tourist attraction)   Seaboard Air Line Railroad Orlando station  (Central Avenue Station)       [ edit ]   Rail transit   In 2005, Federal and state funding was granted for the establishment of  SunRail , a local  commuter rail  service, to operate on the CSX A line tracks between DeLand and Poinciana, passing through the downtown area and surrounding urban neighborhoods along the way. The service is expected to substantially reduce traffic congestion along the I-4 corridor, especially between downtown Orlando and the suburban communities in Seminole and Volusia Counties. The Federal and state funds would cover approximately 80% of the estimated $400 million cost for track modifications and construction of stations along the route. The counties involved approved local matching funds in 2007, and the line is projected to begin operations in 2011. [ 25 ]   Attempts to study a  light rail  service for the Orlando area have met with resistance in the past. Orlando was also considered a focus of the  Florida High Speed Rail  system, which was mandated by state referendum in 2000 but repealed in 2004.     [ edit ]   Bus     [ edit ]   Regional   Orlando is served by  LYNX ; it provides local transit service covering a five-county area:  Orange ,  Seminole ,  Osceola ,  Lake , and  Volusia . [ 26 ]  Bus route schedules and maps can be found at  LYNX Official Website .     [ edit ]   National   Additionally,  Greyhound Lines  offers intercity bus service from Orlando to multiple locations across the country. The Orlando Greyhound Station is located west of Downtown Orlando.     [ edit ]   Crime   In 2006, based on the Department of Justice's FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division, Orlando reported 4,300 violent crimes including 49 murders, [ 27 ]  a record number since 36 in 1982. Crime in Orlando has been up 329% since 2006. Based on the  Morgan Quitno  Press ""Safest and Most Dangerous Cities of 2007"" rankings, Orlando ranks as the eleventh most dangerous city nationally.   Crime is being attacked by Orlando authorities with the installation of security cameras in Orlando. Traffic lights are merged with cameras cabable of detecting out of ordinary activity. Once a smart camera detects this activity it will zoom in on people of interest in an effort to identify them. It can also zoom in on a license plate.

By  Theresa Johnston , About.com    See More About: orange county convention center orlando home & garden shows annual events in orlando               Thousands attend the Annual Orlando Home Show each  September  at the  Orange County Convention Center  in hopes of getting charged up and motivated to make improvements in their home life. Attending in record numbers, area residents come to view the largest consumer showcase of new products and services for the home, furnishings and landscaping. The annual event is held for just three days in mid September. Each year invitees include celebrity guests and national experts discussing topics pertaining to home repair, remodeling and purchasing. Some topics presented offer practical, home-related advice on everything from energy efficiency to wine and food pairing.    More than 500 exhibits representing over 50 products and home-improvement items line the isles at the Orange County Convention Center. Exhibitors hand out pamphlets, samples and sometimes ‘freebies’ in an effort to entice individuals to spend a few minutes at their booths. Products can be ordered, services scheduled and in some cases items are available for sale right on the spot.   On-site parking is available at the Convention Center for a fee. Locals should always remember to ask if Florida resident discounts apply for parking. Tickets can be purchased on-line which is a huge time saver. Each year the show does offer savings for different fundraiser participation and discounted days and times. It’s best to check their site for further information.     Orlando Home Show Tips:   Check the  schedule  of guest presenters to find times and topics that are of the most interest to you.  Wear shoes that will be comfortable for several hours of walking.   Bring a note pad to keep track of interesting ideas.   Check for directions to the  Orlando Convention Center .  Check the  Orlando Home Show  page for updated information regarding show dates/times, parking and cost.

It is this independence coupled with the fact that Tax Collectors deal with a variety of duties and responsibilities and provide a myriad of important public services, that allow them to exercise valuable leadership roles in Florida's government.   The elected county office of Tax Collector in Florida was established in the 1885  State Constitution  based on the idea that local taxes could best be collected at the local level. By being an elected office the Tax Collector would be more responsible to the needs of the community from which he was elected.   Along with their involvement in their own personnel and financial management matters, Tax Collectors participate in the management of the executive branches of state government which include the  Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission , the  Department of Highway Safety  and Motor Vehicles and the  Department of Revenue .   The Tax Collector sees all of these departments as a whole and, consequently, is able to coordinate and analyze the impact they have collectively. Staff members from various departments of state along with state legislators should and do draw heavily on the broad base of knowledge accumulated by the Tax Collectors in drafting tax legislation and establishing rules and regulations for carrying out the laws regarding the collection of taxes.   Mission Statement   The Tax Collector is a value-driven organization dedicated to responsive, respectful and courteous customer service. Alachua County will be viewed as an innovative and progressive leader in the provision of effective and efficient County Services, recognizing the needs of its diverse community.                                                            Duties and Responsibilities   The Office of Tax Collector is authorized by  Florida's Constitution , as a separate entity from other County Departments or Agencies. The Tax Collector is elected by the Citizens of Alachua County and is privileged to serve four year terms.   The Tax Collector is an agent for various state and local government agencies, for the collection of revenue and public funding. It is the responsibility of the Tax Collector to invest these revenues and funds, pending their timely distribution, to various state, local agencies, and taxing authorities.   The Tax Collector operates as a ""fee officer"", which means a fee or commission is earned for the services rendered. These fees and commissions are outlined in the  Florida Statutes , and established by the Florida Legislature. The annual budget must be approved by the Florida  Department of Revenue , and includes any amendments made during each fiscal year. Excess fees are remitted to each government agency, in the same proportion as they were paid, at the end of each fiscal year.       The following is a more detailed description of Tax Collector Responsibilities!    Ad Valorem and non-Ad Valorem Taxes    The Tax Collector is responsible for collecting and distributing taxes, from information provided on the annual tax roll, which is provided by the Property Appraiser's Office. The Ad Valorem tax roll consists of real estate taxes and tangible personal property taxes. The Non- Ad valorem tax roll is prepared and provided to the Board of County Commissioners by the Tax Collector's Office. Non-Ad Valorem assessments are primarily assessments for fire services and solid waste collection and disposal. The collection of taxes, as well as the assessment, is in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Florida Department of Revenue, and Florida Statutes. These taxes are collected; beginning November 1st each year, and become delinquent April 1st. Discounts are given for early payment.   On or before June 1st each year, the Tax Collector holds a tax certificate sale, on properties with unpaid real estate taxes. The purpose of the sale is to collect unpaid taxes on behalf of the numerous taxing authorities. A tax certificate represents a lien on the property. When a tax certificate is redeemed, the Tax Collector is responsible for remitting the funds to the certificate holder. Funds for a County held certificate are dispersed to the different taxing authorities.   Note: Real Estate Taxes and Tangible Personal Property Taxes may be paid in installments. You may download the application, or stop by the Main Office and pick them up. For more information please call the Main Office, 352-374-5236   Tangible Personal Property Taxes   This is a tax levied against equipment, furniture, and supplies of a business, or attachments to a mobile home located in a mobile home park. The assessed value is determined by the Property Appraiser, and the tangible roll is then certified to the tax Collector for collection. The statements are mailed at the same time as real estate bills, and receive the same discounts.   Note:  Real Estate Taxes and Tangible Personal Property Taxes may be paid in installments. You may  download  the application, or stop by the Main Office and pick them up. For more information please call the Main Office, 352-374-5236.   Local Business Tax   A Local Business Tax is a miscellaneous tax imposed by local government, in accordance with county ordinance, which also charges the Tax Collector with the responsibility of collection and disbursement of fees. The Receipt grants the privilege of engaging in or managing a business, the fee for these Receipts is $ 52.50-$ 525.00 per year. The receipt expires September 30th each year and is renewable on or before October 1st.   Tourist Development Tax   Florida Legislature amended the ""Local Option Tourist Development Act"", to allow for collection and administration of the tourist tax at the local level. The Alachua County Board of County Commissioners adopted an ordinance, which provides for collection, and administration of the tourist tax, and charged the Tax Collector with the duty of collection and distribution.   PRIVILEGE TAX COLLECTIONS    Hunting and Fishing Licenses    As an agent for  The Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission , the Tax Collector is responsible for the sale of hunting and fishing permits.

Tag/License Plates    As an agent for  The Department of Highway Safety , Division of Motor Vehicles, the Tax Collector is responsible for issuance of automobile license plates/decals, mobile home decals, disabled persons parking permits, vessel decals, and title applications where applicable. The Tax Collector is responsible for maintenance of records, reporting sales, accounting for inventory, and dispersing monies collected in a timely manner to the Division of Motor Vehicles. The issuance of registrations and title applications is done in accordance with rules and regulations of the Department of Highway Safety, Division of Motor Vehicles, and Florida Statutes.                                                              Sales Tax   Sales tax is required, by Florida Statute, at 6% of the purchase price, less trade-in, on vehicle purchases.

And the group used the forum to repeat the tourism industry's longstanding mantra that local hotel taxes should be spent on tourism advertising -- rather than, as some community activists have long argued, on local needs such as roads, schools and cops.     Council member Pat Engfer, the general manager of the Hyatt hotel at Orlando International Airport, said the community should remember ""what the purpose of the tax was"" when it was originally imposed. ""It is to promote tourism, so we can keep our industry healthy, so we can keep our economy healthy,"" she said.    Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty, clearly stung by criticism that his administration is spending more money on tourism ads than on bus service, said the local economy would likely be in worse shape if the county hadn't set aside $46 million this year for marketing. ""I'm pretty proud that we authorized the advertising campaign,"" Crotty said.    Crotty also made sure to note that state law currently restricts how counties can spend the bed tax. But then again, there are often efforts to expand that law, though such efforts are usually snuffed out by tourism industry lobbying.     Aside from the tax talk, the brief meeting offered a glimpse of how things are going at the Orange County Convention Center.     County auditors report that the convention center's operating revenues are up 21.5 percent through the first nine months of its fiscal year to $54.2 million. Its operating expenses, on the other hand, have risen only 9.8 percent to $50.6 million. That means the convention center has churned out operating revenues of $3.6 million so far this year, which is good news because any shortfalls have to be patched with hotel taxes.

It's the worst drop at the airport since October 2004 -- nearly four years ago -- when passenger counts plunged 6.2 percent in the midst of a chaotic hurricane season. This drop comes with airlines reducing flights and raising fares and the national economy sputtering.     OIA's June 2008 numbers were dragged down by domestic travel, which slumped 4 percent for the month to about 2.9 million passengers. International traffic fared much better, rising 9.3 percent to 184,000 travelers on the strength of a weak U.S. dollar and service from Lufthansa and Aer Lingus that only began last fall.     For the first half of the year, domestic travel was up 2.4 percent to 17.9 million passengers. International traffic was up 23.1 percent to 1.4 million.

During the Walt Disney Co.'s third-quarter earnings call yesterday afternoon, analyst Richard Greenfield of Pali Capital asked executives about the ""new Disney Vacation Club supposedly being opened up shortly next to the Contemporary.""     Not surprisingly, Disney CEO Bob Iger didn't take the bait, saying only that Disney is focused on selling the currently available time shares in the Animal Kingdom Lodge. (Disney still has yet to announce its plans for the Contemporary tower, though it has already applied for -- and received -- approval to sell time shares out of it under the resort name ""Bay Lake Tower."")     Here's Iger's full response:    ""The focus right now on the Vacation Clubs is in selling the Animal Kingdom property -- both the conversion of the Vacation Clubs in the Animal Kingdom hotel, as well as the additional Vacation Club units that we're creating in a new building structure adjacent to that hotel. And therefore the focus is on selling that. And that's why we've made no other announcements, nor have we put any other new Vacation properties online, meaning for sale.""    One other DVC note from the call: Disney CFO Tom Staggs said Vacation Club units sold during the third quarter at about the same pace as a year ago. ""They had nice sales, but they were about on par with the prior year,"" he said.

The extra ""eyes and ears"" would be paid for with a special tax assessment on some of the businesses in the area, said Luann Brooks, executive director of the International Drive Master Transit & Improvement District.    The program would supplement regular law enforcement each day with 10 additional officers, who would focus on known crime hot spots during peak hours.    It would also include community ""ambassadors,"" much like those now working in downtown Orlando.    More  here .

Disney's quarterly earnings of 66 cents a share included a one-time, 4-cent-a-share gain related to the company's reacquisition of the Disney Stores retail chain in North America. But even without that bonus, its earnings outpaced the 57 cents a share from last year's third quarter and the 61-cent consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.    Disney's fiscal third quarter, which ended June 28, generated $9.24 billion in revenue and a profit of $1.28 billion. Both were improvements from the same quarter in 2007, when Disney reported revenue of $9.05 billion and a profit of $1.18 billion.    ""We've had another solid quarter at the Walt Disney Company, further illustrating our creative momentum, the competitive strength of our brands and our ability to cohesively manage a great collection of assets to maximize shareholder value,"" said Robert A. Iger, the company's president and chief executive officer.    More  here .

Organized by the Orlando/Orange County Convention & Visitors Bureau, the task force is being led by Ed Fouche, senior vice president of travel industry sales and marketing for Walt Disney World and Disney Cruise Line.    It also includes representatives from Universal Orlando, SeaWorld Orlando, the Central Florida Hotel & Lodging Association and some broader business groups, such as the Metro Orlando Economic Development Commission.    Gary Sain, chief executive of the convention and visitors bureau, said the group intends to meet with executives of the airlines serving Orlando. The group plans to travel to the headquarters of three major carriers in August, he said, though he declined to identify the airlines.    ""Really, the overall goal is to ensure that we always have adequate/sufficient lift for the destination,"" he said.    More  here .

Airline analysts at Credit Suisse say concerns among some investors that Orlando-based AirTran Airways could eventually become a bankruptcy candidate are off base. Among their reasons? Because the Boeing Co. could very well come to AirTran's rescue, if necessary.     In a research note, analysts Daniel McKenzie and Bryan Brokmeier note that AirTran actually leases 77 of the 87 Boeing 717s in its fleet from Boeing, rather than owning the planes outright. That means, they write, Boeing ""is incented to keep AAI [AirTran] out of financial trouble.""     What's more, they add, ""Boeing has historically stepped up to help important customers, not just with a/c [aircraft] deferrals but financially...""

Thomson Reuters is projecting consensus earnings in the range of 61 cents and revenue in the neighborhood of $9.1 billion, based on that firm's survey of analysts. The range of earnings projections found in the survey was from 56 cents to 65 cents, while revenue projections ranged from $8.7 billion to $9.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.    If Disney meets the consensus expectations, both earnings and revenue would be up over the same quarter in 2007, when the company paid 57 cents in earnings on just about $9 billion in revenue.    After filing the report, Disney President and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger and Chief Financial Officer Thomas Staggs will present the earnings during a 4:30 p.m. eastern time conference call.

If the numbers are accurate, they could mark one of the first signs that airline schedule cuts and a slumping national economy are starting to erode travel to Orlando.    The newsletter, put out by the Orlando/Orange County Convention & Visitors Bureau, says just under 3.1 million passengers passed through OIA in June. That compares with just under 3.2 million who came through the airport in June 2007.    Airport traffic is still up just over 6.1 percent for the  entire year  last 12 months, according to the CVB's figures.     OIA itself hasn't formally released June traffic stats yet. An airport spokeswoman said she would check on the visitor bureau's figures. The last time monthly passenger traffic declined at OIA was March 2007, though it only dipped 0.13 percent when compared March 2006.    UPDATE : OIA spokeswoman Carolyn Fennell said she believes the visitor bureau obtained its numbers from internal meetings that included airport representatives. ""I think it was in a research meeting,"" she said.    Fennell said OIA is still working on official tallies, though she did not dispute the CVB's numbers. The airport is aiming to release formal figures sometime this week, she said.

The package offers two quick service meals and two snacks for each night of stay, as well as a refillable drink mug for unlimited refills of non-alcoholic beverages at Disney resort hotels.

The airline, which will also raise fees to check specialty items such as surfboards or skis, said it is increasing the charge in response to ever-higher fuel prices. The higher fee will apply to tickets purchased beginning this Thursday (July 31) for travel on or after Aug. 5.

""It's just prudent management to make sure we've got our bases covered and we're not losing money unnecessarily,"" said Steve Baker of Orlando-based Baker Leisure Group, hired at the start of the year to manage the Winter Haven attraction after the new owners purchased it out of bankruptcy.    With the economy stacked against it, the park will open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays only and focus on big weekend events. Baker couldn't say whether the reduced hours would continue in October or beyond.    ""It's just one step at a time here,"" he said.    More  here .

The low-fare airline's loss amounted to 12 cents a share, and it marked a dramatic plunge from the airline's profits of $42.1 million, or 42 cents a share, during the second quarter last year. AirTran's total fuel bill ballooned $167 million to $368 million.    AirTran also said it would make even deeper flight cuts, reducing capacity by between seven percent and eight percent during the final four months of the year. It had earlier projected capacity cuts of at least five percent. The airline also said it now plans to reduce capacity between four and eight percent next year.    Hoping to reassure anxious investors that it is still on solid financial footing, AirTran noted that it ended the quarter with $445.9 million in unrestricted cash and investment balance, the highest balance in company history. It also said it has obtained a letter of credit for up to $150 million to protect against the company's credit-card processors increasing the amount of money they withhold from AirTran between the time a ticket is sold and the actual flight.     ""As in recent quarters, AirTran Airways posted record revenues, but the steep cost of fuel costs is still an enormous challenge for the entire airline industry and revenue gains are not keeping pace with the all-time high fuel costs,"" AirTran Chairman and CEO Bob Fornaro said in a written statement.

Bracing for the possibility that revenue could tail off substantially this fall after airlines enact deep service cuts, airport Executive Director Steve Gardner has ordered several big-ticket construction projects postponed indefinitely.    Among them: an overhaul of the airport's main ticket lobbies. Boosters were hoping the project would give passengers more room for moving about during the often crowded check-in process.    The ticket-lobby overhaul was among the most expensive items included in a five-year, nearly $1 billion capital-improvement program that OIA recently negotiated with its major airline tenants. It was supposed to begin before the end of the year; now it won't begin until 2009 at the earliest, Gardner said.    He said several other construction projects also will be deferred until at least 2009.    More  here .

New financial reports show Disney in mid-June wrote a $10,000 check to a group called the ""Alliance for a Strong Economy."" That's a political fundraising organization that was recently formed by six Republican senators, including Senate President Ken Pruitt of Port St. Lucie and Central Florida Sens. Mike Haridopolos of Indialantic, J.D. Alexander of Winter Haven and Carey Baker of Eustis.     Disney is one of six donors to the group so far. Others include Florida Power & Light, which gave $15,000, and the American Insurance Association, which gave $25,000.

Despite falling home values and rising gas prices, Central Florida tourism prospered in early 2008. But now, tourism officials are wondering how long their good fortune will last.    ""We've become so accustomed to great growth in Orlando . . . that it's almost become the norm,"" said Scott Smith, an instructor and lodging expert in the University of Central Florida's Rosen College of Hospitality Management. ""We're spoiled in some ways.""    Theme parks reported bigger first-quarter crowds -- but nearly every major airline is cutting service to Orlando this fall. Hotels filled a few more rooms during the first few months of the year than they did a year earlier -- but the region's main convention center will host fewer shows this fall than it did last fall.    Once again, Americans are booking vacations on short notice -- as little as a week out in some cases. The same thing happened after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, but this time the fear is tied to rising unemployment.

A spokewoman for Osceola County Health Department said they tested the banquet food for  bacillus and staph after an illness broke out at the hotel July 6, sending nine people to the hospital.  While they've ruled out those two bacteria, which can cause foodborne illness, they haven't ruled out other causes of foodborne illness.  The department is still investigating and hopes to close the case in about two weeks.      Gaylord Palms has said that, based on interviews with guests who were affected, it does not believe its food was to blame.  After the incident, hotel spokesman Keith Salwoski said one person who got sick said she was trying to lose weight and had not eaten anything all day.

Empty storefronts spread in the strip shopping centers. The Festival Bay Mall was supposed to lead a revitalization but also has succumbed to a growing cancer of vacant spaces.    As a Category 4 recession approaches, you have to wonder how far the contagion will spread along one of the nation's top tourism strips.    More  here .

""It's an important day for Orange County, as we celebrate the home stretch of a Hilton Orlando convention center. The hotel will make -- and has already made -- a significant impact in Orlando to attract the larger conventions,"" said Orange County Commissioner Bill Segal, who was among the local politicians on hand for the ceremony.    Ira Mitzner, an executive with Rida Development Corp., the hotel developer, said the Hilton's construction helped spur the adjacent Peabody Hotel to press forward with its own long-planned expansion. He said the twin projects should benefit everyone in the area by helping to lure bigger trade shows to Orlando.     ""You have a whole menu of rooms  "
