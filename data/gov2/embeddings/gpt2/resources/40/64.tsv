Where 8 bits are allowed, the  EUC-KR  encoding is preferred.  These two encodings combine US-ASCII ( ISO 646 ) with the Korean standard  KS X 1001 :1992 [ 1 ]  (previously named KS C 5601:1987). In  North Korea , a separate character set called  KPS 9566  is in use, which is rather similar to KS X 1001.   The international  Unicode  standard contains special characters for representing the Korean language in the native  Hangul  phonetic system. There are two ways supported by Unicode. The way used by Windows is to have every one of the 11,571 syllable combinations as a code and a pre-formed font character. The other way is to encode  jamos , and to let the software combine them into correct combinations, which is not supported in Windows. Of course the former way needs more font memory, but gives the possibility of getting better shapes, since it is complicated to create fully correct combinations which may be preferred when creating documents.   There is also the possibility of simply stacking a (sequence of)  medial (s) ( jungseong )  and then a (sequence of)  final (s) ( jongseong ) and/or a Middle Korean pitch mark, if needed  on top of the (sequence of)  initial (s) ( choseong ), if the font has medial and final  jamos  with zero-width spacing that are inserted to the left of the cursor or caret, thus appearing in the right place below or to the right of the initial. If a syllable has a horizontal medial (  ,   ,   ,    or   ), the initial will probably appear further left in a complete syllable than is the case in pre-formed syllables due to the space that must be reserved for a vertical medial, giving an aesthetically poor appearance to what may be the only way to display Middle Korean Hangul text without resorting to images, romanisation, replacement of obsolete jamo or non-standard encodings. However, most current fonts do not support this.   The  Unicode  standard also has attempted to create a unified  CJK  character set that can represent Chinese ( Hanzi ) as well as the Japanese ( Kanji ) and Korean ( Hanja ) derivatives of this script through the  Han unification  process, which does not discriminate by language nor region for rendering Chinese characters, as long as the different typographic traditions have not resulted in major differences concerning what the character looks like  see  Image:Xin-jiu-zixing.png  for examples of characters whose appearance recently underwent only minor changes in Mainland China. Han unification has met with some criticism.     [ edit ]   Text input     See also:  Input method editor ,  List of input methods for UNIX platforms ,  Japanese input methods , and  Chinese input methods for computers     On a Korean computer keyboard, text is typically entered by simply pushing a key for the appropriate  Jamo ; the operating system creates each composite character on the fly. Depending on the IME and keyboard layout, double consonants can be entered by holding the shift button. When all jamo making up a syllabic block have been entered, the user may initiate a conversion to Hanja or other special characters using a keyboard shortcut or interface button; South Korean keyboards have a separate key for this. Subsequent semi-automated hanja conversion is supported to varying degrees in word processors.   When using a keyboard from another language, most operating systems require the user to type using an original Korean keyboard layout, the most common of which is  2(du)-beolsik . This is in contrast to some other languages like Japanese, where text can be entered using a Romanization system on non-native keyboards.     [ edit ]   Hanja   Apart from the conversion issues mentioned above, some Korean fonts do not include hanja to start with. At the same time, current word processors do not allow the user to specify which font to use as a fallback for any hanja that may occur in a text. In that case, each sequence of hanja must be manually formatted to appear in the desired font.     [ edit ]   Special situations   Having text run in vertical lines is poorly or not at all supported by HTML and most word processors, although this is not an issue for modern Korean, as it is usually written horizontally. Until the second half of the 20th century, however, Korean was often written vertically. 15th century texts written in Hangul had pitch marks to the left of syllables, which are included in Unicode, although most current fonts do not adequately support them, either.   See the section on  #Character encodings  above for obsolete jamo.     [ edit ]   Programs   Notable programs specifically designed for Korean language-related use include:     Language recognition    A North Korean  speech recognition  program is said to recognise 100,000 words and to achieve a success rate of more than 90%. [ 2 ]   Mongnan  (  ;  KCC [ 3 ] , North Korea)   Optical character recognition software  with an alleged success rate of 99% for printed text and 95% for  handwriting recognition . [ 2 ]       Input method editors     Tan'gun  (  ;  Pyongyang Information Center , North Korea)  Allows the use of Hangul on English editions of Windows.

(Only works on Microsoft Windows)   Nabi  (  ),  ami  (  ; South Korea) - Allows to type Hangul on  Linux .       Word processors   All programs listed below include domestic Hangul fonts, non-Hangul fonts and a Hangul hanja  conversion utility.    Hangul  ( Haansoft , South Korea)   Ch'angdk  (  ; PIC, [ 3 ]  North Korea)  This popular program exists in an  MS-DOS  version developed in April 1990 [1]  and a Windows version developed in 1996. [ 4 ]  It includes a peculiar  personality cult  feature by which pressing  Ctrl+I  or  Ctrl+J  produces titles exalting  Kim Il-sung  and  Kim Jong-il , respectively.

The value of initial Jamo  is 18   The value of medial Jamo  is 0   The value of final Jamo  is 4     So, the formula will be {(18588)+(028)+4}+44032, and the result is 54620. It means the Unicode value of  is 54620 in decimal,  &#54620;  by the  numeric character reference , and U+D55C in standard Unicode notation.     [ edit ]   Hangul Compatibility Jamo Area   Hangul Compatibility Jamo Area  is a part of Unicode, which has been allocated for compatibility with the  KS X 1001  character set. Usually it is used for representing modern Hangul jamo and some obsolete Hangul Jamo, without distinguishing  initial  and  final .     [ edit ]   Hangul Jamo Area   Hangul Jamo Area  is a range of Unicode between U+1100U+11FF. It contains  initial jamo ,  medial jamo  and  final jamo , also including obsolete jamo.  Nalgaeset Hangul IME  and  Un Jamo Batang  represent obsolete Hangul using this area.     [ edit ]   Hanyang Private Use Area codes   Hangul (word processor)  ships with fonts from Hanyang Information and Communication. Their fonts map obsolete Hangul characters to the  Private Use Area  of Unicode. Despite the use of the Private Use Area instead of dedicated codepoints, Hanyangs mapping is currently the most popular way to represent obsolete Hangul in South Korea.

There are many theories to differentiate the Korean language histories  [ 2 ] ,  [ 3 ] ,  [ 4 ] ,  [ 5 ] ,  [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ,  [ 8 ] ,  [ 9 ] . It is distinct from  Proto-Korean  ( ), which is the reconstructed language from which Korean is hypothesized to have evolved. However, there is controversy whether Korean language actually has been separated from Altaic language. Old Korean may have been a  tonal language , although this has not been clearly established. [ 10 ]  The old Korean languages are divided into two. It is assumed that the Sillan dialect has its roots to middle and modern Korean, while the Buyeo language, spoken by Goguryeo and Baekje and other Korean states before the Three kingdoms period and the ones that co-existed in the era has similarities with the Sillan dialect.   Only some literary records of Unified Silla, changed into Goryeo text, are extant and some texts (written in their native Writing system) of the Three kingdoms period are mostly available in form of inscriptions at present. Thus, the languages of the Three Kingdoms period are generally examined through official government names and local district names. The point at which Old Korean became  Middle Korean  is assessed variously by different scholars. The line is sometimes drawn in the late Goryeo dynasty, and sometimes around the 15th century in the early  Joseon Dynasty . But it is usually thought that Middle Korea started at the establishment of Goryeo, and the standard language of Old Korean was changed from the Silla dialect to the Goryeo dialect.

The first texts in Old Korean date from the  Three Kingdoms  period. They are written using Chinese characters to represent the sound and grammar of the native language. Various systems were used, beginning with  ad hoc  approaches and gradually becoming codified in the scribal  idu  system and the  hyangchal  system used for poetry.   Additional information about the language is drawn from various proper nouns recorded in Korean and Chinese records, and from etymological studies of the Korean pronunciations of Chinese characters, which are believed to have been first adapted into Korean in the late Three Kingdoms period.     [ edit ]   Writing system   Chinese script  was borrowed to represent the sound. Some [ who? ]  say that another writing system existed such as  Gugyeol , but Gugyeol was only a system of phonetic symbols for the Chinese script.     [ edit ]   Languages   In the age of Three Kingdoms, it has not been definitely proven that the three kingdoms all used the same language, but it is accepted by many scholars that the Three Kingdoms utilized similar languages, and that these may have been dialects of a single language [ 11 ] .

The language is also spoken widely in neighbouring  Yanbian ,  China .  Worldwide, there are around 78 million Korean speakers, including large groups in the former  Soviet Union , the  United States ,  Canada ,  Brazil  and  Japan . Proper  classification  of Korean is not universally agreed on, but it is often considered by many to be a  language isolate . Some linguists instead group it in the hypothetical  Altaic  language family.  The native Korean writing system—called  Hangul —is  syllabic  and phonetic.   Sino-Korean  characters ( Hanja ) are also used in writing.  While the most commonly used words in the language are of native Korean origin, well over 50% of the language's vocabulary consists of words composed from  Hanja .  Korean is  agglutinative  in its word formation and  SOV  in its syntax.

The Korean names for the language are based on the  names for Korea  used in North and South  Korea.    In North Korea, Korea is called ""Chosŏn"" (조선), and the language is most often called ""Chosŏnmal"" (조선말) or more formally, ""Chosŏnŏ"" (조선어).  In South Korea, Korea is called ""Hanguk"" (In  Hangul : 한국).  There and outside of Korea, the language is most often called ""Hangungmal"" (한국말), or more formally, ""Hangugeo"" (한국어).  The language is also sometimes referred to colloquially as ""Urimal"" (우리말; ""our language"").  The standard language taught in schools is often referred to as ""Gugeo"" (국어; ""national language"").  Korea was also called ""Chosŏn"" (""Chosen"" in  Japanese ) during the  Japanese Colonial Period  ( 1910 - 1945 ), and so many important linguistic works written during that period also refer to the language by the names ""Chosŏnŏ"" or ""Chosŏnmal.""      Classification and related languages   Korean is often classified as being a separate language in a family of its own (a  language isolate ). In addition, most Korean and some Western linguists recognize Korean's kinship to the  Altaic languages . On the other hand, traditional Western (since the 18th century) and many Japanese linguists believe that Korean has a linguistic relationship with  Japanese .  In Korea, the possibility of Korean-Japanese linguistic relationship has been ignored mostly; partly because the often strained relations between the two countries throughout history tend to make any discussion of a relationship between their languages a controversial one, and partly due to the lack of cognates. However, the Korean relationship with  Altaic  and proto-Altaic also have been much argued as of late. It does bear some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely,  Yakut  and some of its variants, and a few linguists believe that Altaic itself forms part of a larger  Ural-Altaic  language family. The opponents of this view believe that much of the  Altaic  influences in the language was infused later in Korean history during the Mongol rule over Korea during the  Goryeo  dynasty. Proponents of this theory cite old Korean cognates to Mongolian to support their claim.  Korean is similar to Altaic language in that they both have: the absence of grammatical elements such as number, genders, articles, fusional morphology, voice, relative pronouns, conjunctions, vowel harmony, and agglutination (Kim Namkil).   In the late 19th century, Homer B. Hulbert, an English linguist, theorised that Korean is related to the Dravidian languages of India. His argument was based on syntatic similarities between Dravidian languages and Korean. Dravidian and Korean are similar syntatically in that they both have: the word order subject-object-verb, postpositions instead of prepositions, no relative pronouns, modifiers in front of the head noun, copula and existential as two distinct grammatical parts of speech etc (Kim Namkil).    Geographic distribution   Most of the speakers of the Korean language live in  North  and  South Korea . However, there are some ethnic Koreans in  China , the former  Soviet Union , and the  United States .    Dialects   Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  (literally speech),  bang-eon , or  saturi  in Korean). The  standard language  ( Pyojuneo  or  Pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yŏngyang . These dialects are similar, and in fact all dialects except that of  Jeju  Island are largely mutually intelligible. The dialect spoken there is classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul Dialect  use stress very little, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of Gyeongsang Dialect  have a very pronounced intonation that makes their dialect sound more like a European language to western ears.  There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.

The symbol   ʼ  is used to denote the tensed consonants (  [pʼ] ,   [tʼ] ,   [cʼ] ,   [kʼ] , and   [sʼ] ) but its official  IPA  usage is for  ejective  consonants, which the tensed stops in Korean are not. The tensed stops are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure. However, it may be argued that such a manner of articulation can still be categorized as  glottalization , justifying the use of   ʼ .    Vowels       Monophthongs   Korean has 8 different vowel qualities and a length distinction. Two more vowels, the close-mid front rounded vowel   [ø]  and the close front rounded vowel   [y] , can still be heard in the speech of some older speakers, but they have been largely replaced by the diphthongs   [we]  and   [wi]  respectively. In a 2003 survey of 350 speakers from Seoul, nearly 90% pronounced the vowel 'ㅟ' as   [wi] . Length distinction is also decreasing; length distinction for all vowels can still be heard from older speakers, but many younger speakers do not always distinguish lengths consistently.             i       siˈɟaŋ     sijang     'hunger'       iː       ˈsiːɟaŋ     sijang     'market'             e       peˈɡɛ     begae     'pillow'       eː       ˈpeːda     beda     'cut'             ɛ       tʰɛˈjaŋ     taeyang     'sun'       ɛː       ˈtʰɛːdo     taedo     'attitude'             a       ˈmal     mal     'horse'       aː       ˈmaːl     mal     'speech'             o       poˈli     bori     'barley'       oː       ˈpoːsu     bosu     'salary'             u       kuˈli     guri     'copper'       uː       ˈsuːbak     subak     'watermelon'             ʌ       ˈpʌl     beol     'punishment'       ʌː       ˈpʌːl     beol     'bee'             ɯ       ˈʌːlɯn     eoreun     'seniors'       ɯː       ˈɯːmsik     eumsik     'food'         Diphthongs and glides   [j]  and   [w]  are considered to be components of diphthongs rather than separate consonant phonemes.                           wi   dwi   dwi 'back'           ɯi   ˈɯisa uisa 'doctor'        je   ˈjeːsan yesan 'budget'           we   kwe gwe 'box'                        jɛ   ˈjɛːki yaegi 'story'           wɛ   wɛ wae 'why'                        ja   ˈjaːgu yagu 'baseball'           wa   kwaːˈil kwa-il 'fruits'                        jo   ˈkjoːs’a gyosa 'teacher'                                        ju   juˈli yuri 'glass'                                        jʌ   jʌːgi yeogi 'here'           wʌ   mwʌ mweo 'what'                     Source:  Handbook of the International Phonetic Association     Phonology   [s]  becomes palatalized as   [ʃ]  or   [ɕ]  before   [j]  or   [i] .    [h]  becomes labialized   [ɸ]  before   [o]  and   [u]  and palatalized   [ç]  before   [j]  or   [i] .    [p] ,   [t] ,   [c] , and   [k]  become voiced   [b] ,   [d] ,   [ɟ] , and   [ɡ]  between  sonorant  segments.    [l]  becomes alveolar flap   [ɾ]  between  sonorant  segments, such as between two  vowels .  Phonetic rules, mostly  assimilation , transform the pronunciation of some words. For example,       Jong l o  is pronounced as  Jong n o     Han k u k mal  as  Han- g u ng mal     Stop consonants are generally voiceless, but lightly aspirated stops become voiced and unaspirated in intervocalic position. For example,     p -> b   t -> d   k -> g    Stops are nasalized before a nasal. For example,     p -> m (before m, n, or ng)   t -> n (before m, n, or ng)   k -> ng (before m, n, or ng)    Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying  morphology .  One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial   [r]  (also the initial   [n]  before   [i]  or   [y] ). For example,     勞動 north:  r odong , south:  n odong  (labour)   歷史 north:  ry ŏksa , south:  y eoksa  (history)   女子 north:  ny ŏja , south:  y eoja  (lady)    Vowel harmony   Traditionally, the Korean language has had strong  vowel harmony ; that is, in pre-modern Korean, as in most Altaic languages, not only did the inflectional and derivational affixes (such as  postpositions ) change in accordance to the main root vowel, but native words also adhered to vowel harmony.  It is not as prevalent in modern usage, although it remains strong in  onomatopoeia ,  adjectives  and  adverbs ,  interjections , and  conjugation . There are also other traces of vowel harmony in Korean.           Korean Vowel Harmony       Positive/Yang Vowels   ㅏ (a)   ㅑ (ya)   ㅗ (o)   ㅛ (yo)         ㅐ (ae)   ㅘ (wa)   ㅚ (oe)   ㅙ (wae)       Negative/Yin Vowels   ㅓ (eo)   ㅕ (yeo)   ㅜ (u)   ㅠ (yu)         ㅔ (e)   ㅝ (weo)   ㅟ (wi)   ㅞ (we)       Neutral/Centre Vowels   ㅡ (eu)   ㅣ (i)   ㅢ (eui)      There are three classes of vowels in Korean: positive, negative, and neutral. The vowel ŭ is considered partially a neutral and negative vowel. The vowel classes loosely follow the mid (negative) and front (positive) vowels; they also follow orthography. Exchanging positive vowels with negative vowels usually creates different nuances of meaning.    Examples   Onomatopoeia:   퐁당퐁당 (pong-dang-pong-dang)  풍덩풍덩 (pung-deong-pung-deong) (Water splashing)    Adjectives/Adverbs:   무럭무럭 (mureokmureok) and 모락모락 (morakmorak) can both be translated as ""rapidly"" or ""densely"", but each has different connotations:  연기가 모락모락 나다 ( yeonggiga morakmorak nada ) Smoke rises up.  나무가 무럭무럭 자란다 ( Namuga mureokmureok jaranda ) The tree grows well.       Emphasised Adjectives:   노랗다 (noratta) means plain yellow, while its negative, 누렇다 (nureotta) means very yellow  파랗다 (paratta) means plain blue, while its negative, 퍼렇다 (peoreota) means deep blue    Particles at the end of verbs:   잡다 (Japda) (to catch) → 잡았다 (Jabatda) (caught)  접다 (Jeopda) (to fold) → 접었다 (Jeobeotda) (folded)    Interjections:   아이고 (Aigo) and 어이구 (Eoigu) meaning ""oh my!""  어허 (Eoheo) and 아하 (Aha) meaning ""indeed"" and ""well"" respectively      Grammar   Korean is an  agglutinative language . The basic form of a Korean sentence is Subject-Object-Verb ( SOV ), and modifiers precede the modified word. As a side note, a sentence can break the SOV word order, however, it must end with the verb.  In contrast to the Korean word order, in English, one would say, ""I'm going to the store to buy some food,” in Korean it would be: *""I food to-buy in-order-to store-to going-am.""  In Korean, ""unnecessary"" words (see  theme and rheme ) can be left out of a sentence as long as the context makes the meaning clear. A typical exchange might translate word-for word to the following:    H: ""가게에 가세요?"" ( gage-e gaseyo? )  G: ""예."" ( ye. )      H: *""store-to going?""  G: ""yes.""      which in English would translate to:    H: ""Are you going to the store?""  G: ""Yes.""      Though it is worth noting that in colloquial English one might say 'Going to the store?', it is not considered standard, as it is in Korean.  Unlike most European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense and on the relation between the people speaking. When talking to or about friends, you would use one conjugate ending, to your parents, another, and to nobility/honoured persons, another. This loosely echoes the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages .     Speech levels and honorifics    The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .    Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer to use special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older distant relative (grandparent's sibling, older sibling's spouse, etc.), a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a close relative (grandparent, parent, spouse, or sibling), younger stranger, student, employee or the like. On rare occasions (like when someone wants to pick a fight), a speaker might speak to a superior or stranger in a way normally only used for, say, animals, but no one would do this without seriously considering the consequences to their physical safety first!  One way of using honorifics is to use  special nouns  in place of regular nouns with ""honorific"" ones. A common example is using  jinji  instead of  bap  for ""food"". More often, special nouns are used when speaking about relatives. Thus, the speaker/writer may address his own grandmother as  halmeoni  but refer to someone else's grandmother as  halmeonim . The  m  comes from the honorific suffix  -nim  (님), which is affixed to many kinship terms to make them honorific; thus,  hyeongnim  is the formal term for an older sibling of the same sex (derived from  hyeong,  the informal term for man's older brother;  eonni  is the informal term for a woman's older sister).  All verbs can be converted into an honorific form by adding the infix  -si-  (시, pronounced  shi ) after the  stem  and before the verb ending . Thus,  gada  (""go"") becomes  gasida . A few verbs have special honorific equivalents. Therefore  gyesida  is the honorific form of  itda  (""exist"");  japsusida  is the honorific form of  meokda  (""eat""); and  jumusida  is the honorific form of  jada  (""sleep"").  A few verbs have special humble forms, used when the speaker is referring to him/herself in polite situations. These include  deurida  and  ollida  for  juda  (""give"").  Deurida  is substituted for  juda  when the latter is used as an  auxiliary  verb, while  ollida --which literally means ""raise up""--is used for  juda  in the sense of ""offer"".  Pronouns in Korean  have their own set of polite equivalents: thus,  jeo  is the humble form of  na  (""I"");  jeoheui  is the humble form of  uri  (""we""); and  dangsin  (""friend,"" but only used as a form of address and more polite than ""chingu"", the usual word for ""friend""; also, whereas uses of other humble forms are straightforward, ""dangsin"" must be used only in specific social contexts, such as between two married couple--""dangsin"" can often be used in ironic sense when used between strangers) is the honorific form of  neo  (""you"" (singular). Note: in general, Koreans avoid using second person singular pronoun, especially when using honorific forms, and either i) use the person's name or title in place of ""you"" in English, or ii) use plural ""ieoreobun"" where applicable).    Speech levels   There are no fewer than 7 verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike  honorifics --which are used to show respect towards a subject-- speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb  hada  (""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  che , which means ""style.""  The highest 5 levels use  final  verb endings , while the lowest 2 levels ( haeyoche ) and ( haeche ) use non-final  endings  and are called  banmal  (""half-words"") in Korean. (The  haeyoche  in turn is formed by simply adding the non-final ending  yo  (요) to the  haeche  form of the verb.)  Taken together, honorifics and speech levels form a  cartesian product  of 14 basic verb stems. Here is a table giving the 7 levels, the  present   indicative  form of the verb  hada  (하다; ""do"" in English) in each level in both its honorific and non-honorific forms, and the situations in which each level is used.      Speech Level Non-Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Level of Formality When Used   Hasoseoche (하소서체) hanaida (하나이다) hashinaida (하시나이다) Extremely formal and polite Traditionally used when addressing a king, queen, or high official; now used only in historical dramas and the Bible   Hapshoche (합쇼체) hamnida (합니다) hashimnida (하십니다) Formal and polite Used commonly between strangers, among male co-workers, by TV announcers, and to customers   Haoche (하오체) hao (하오) hasho (하쇼), hashio (하시오) Formal, of neutral politeness Only used nowadays among some older people   Hageche (하게체) hane (하네) hashine (하시네) Formal, of neutral politeness Generally only used by some older people when addressing younger people, friends, or relatives   Haerache (해라체) handa (한다) hashinda (하신다) Formal, of neutral politeness or impolite Used to close friends, relatives of similar age, or younger people; also used almost universally in books, newspapers, and magazines; also used   "

Worldwide, there are around 78 million Korean speakers, including large groups in the former  Soviet Union , the  United States ,  Canada ,  Brazil  and  Japan . Proper  classification  of Korean is not universally agreed on, but it is often considered by many to be a  language isolate . Some linguists instead group it in the hypothetical  Altaic  language family.  The native Korean writing system—called  Hangul —is  syllabic  and phonetic.   Sino-Korean  characters ( Hanja ) are also used in writing.  While the most commonly used words in the language are of native Korean origin, well over 50% of the language's vocabulary consists of words composed from  Hanja .  Korean is  agglutinative  in its word formation and  SOV  in its syntax.

The Korean names for the language are based on the  names for Korea  used in North and South  Korea.    In North Korea, Korea is called ""Chosŏn"" (조선), and the language is most often called ""Chosŏnmal"" (조선말) or more formally, ""Chosŏnŏ"" (조선어).  In South Korea, Korea is called ""Hanguk"" (In  Hangul : 한국).  There and outside of Korea, the language is most often called ""Hangungmal"" (한국말), or more formally, ""Hangugeo"" (한국어).  The language is also sometimes referred to colloquially as ""Urimal"" (우리말; ""our language"").  The standard language taught in schools is often referred to as ""Gugeo"" (국어; ""national language"").  Korea was also called ""Chosŏn"" (""Chosen"" in  Japanese ) during the  Japanese Colonial Period  ( 1910 - 1945 ), and so many important linguistic works written during that period also refer to the language by the names ""Chosŏnŏ"" or ""Chosŏnmal.""      Classification and related languages   Korean is often classified as being a separate language in a family of its own (a  language isolate ). In addition, most Korean and some Western linguists recognize Korean's kinship to the  Altaic languages . On the other hand, traditional Western (since the 18th century) and many Japanese linguists believe that Korean has a linguistic relationship with  Japanese .  In Korea, the possibility of Korean-Japanese linguistic relationship has been ignored mostly; partly because the often strained relations between the two countries throughout history tend to make any discussion of a relationship between their languages a controversial one, and partly due to the lack of cognates. However, the Korean relationship with  Altaic  and proto-Altaic also have been much argued as of late. It does bear some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely,  Yakut  and some of its variants, and a few linguists believe that Altaic itself forms part of a larger  Ural-Altaic  language family. The opponents of this view believe that much of the  Altaic  influences in the language was infused later in Korean history during the Mongol rule over Korea during the  Goryeo  dynasty. Proponents of this theory cite old Korean cognates to Mongolian to support their claim.  Korean is similar to Altaic language in that they both have: the absence of grammatical elements such as number, genders, articles, fusional morphology, voice, relative pronouns, conjunctions, vowel harmony, and agglutination (Kim Namkil).   In the late 19th century, Homer B. Hulbert, an English linguist, theorised that Korean is related to the Dravidian languages of India. His argument was based on syntatic similarities between Dravidian languages and Korean. Dravidian and Korean are similar syntatically in that they both have: the word order subject-object-verb, postpositions instead of prepositions, no relative pronouns, modifiers in front of the head noun, copula and existential as two distinct grammatical parts of speech etc (Kim Namkil).    Geographic distribution   Most of the speakers of the Korean language live in  North  and  South Korea . However, there are some ethnic Koreans in  China , the former  Soviet Union , and the  United States .    Dialects   Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  (literally speech),  bang-eon , or  saturi  in Korean). The  standard language  ( Pyojuneo  or  Pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yŏngyang . These dialects are similar, and in fact all dialects except that of  Jeju  Island are largely mutually intelligible. The dialect spoken there is classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul Dialect  use stress very little, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of Gyeongsang Dialect  have a very pronounced intonation that makes their dialect sound more like a European language to western ears.  There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.

The symbol   ʼ  is used to denote the tensed consonants (  [pʼ] ,   [tʼ] ,   [cʼ] ,   [kʼ] , and   [sʼ] ) but its official  IPA  usage is for  ejective  consonants, which the tensed stops in Korean are not. The tensed stops are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure. However, it may be argued that such a manner of articulation can still be categorized as  glottalization , justifying the use of   ʼ .    Vowels       Monophthongs   Korean has 8 different vowel qualities and a length distinction. Two more vowels, the close-mid front rounded vowel   [ø]  and the close front rounded vowel   [y] , can still be heard in the speech of some older speakers, but they have been largely replaced by the diphthongs   [we]  and   [wi]  respectively. In a 2003 survey of 350 speakers from Seoul, nearly 90% pronounced the vowel 'ㅟ' as   [wi] . Length distinction is also decreasing; length distinction for all vowels can still be heard from older speakers, but many younger speakers do not always distinguish lengths consistently.             i       siˈɟaŋ     sijang     'hunger'       iː       ˈsiːɟaŋ     sijang     'market'             e       peˈɡɛ     begae     'pillow'       eː       ˈpeːda     beda     'cut'             ɛ       tʰɛˈjaŋ     taeyang     'sun'       ɛː       ˈtʰɛːdo     taedo     'attitude'             a       ˈmal     mal     'horse'       aː       ˈmaːl     mal     'speech'             o       poˈli     bori     'barley'       oː       ˈpoːsu     bosu     'salary'             u       kuˈli     guri     'copper'       uː       ˈsuːbak     subak     'watermelon'             ʌ       ˈpʌl     beol     'punishment'       ʌː       ˈpʌːl     beol     'bee'             ɯ       ˈʌːlɯn     eoreun     'seniors'       ɯː       ˈɯːmsik     eumsik     'food'         Diphthongs and glides   [j]  and   [w]  are considered to be components of diphthongs rather than separate consonant phonemes.                           wi   dwi   dwi 'back'           ɯi   ˈɯisa uisa 'doctor'        je   ˈjeːsan yesan 'budget'           we   kwe gwe 'box'                        jɛ   ˈjɛːki yaegi 'story'           wɛ   wɛ wae 'why'                        ja   ˈjaːgu yagu 'baseball'           wa   kwaːˈil kwa-il 'fruits'                        jo   ˈkjoːs’a gyosa 'teacher'                                        ju   juˈli yuri 'glass'                                        jʌ   jʌːgi yeogi 'here'           wʌ   mwʌ mweo 'what'                     Source:  Handbook of the International Phonetic Association     Phonology   [s]  becomes palatalized as   [ʃ]  or   [ɕ]  before   [j]  or   [i] .

[p] ,   [t] ,   [c] , and   [k]  become voiced   [b] ,   [d] ,   [ɟ] , and   [ɡ]  between  sonorant  segments.    [l]  becomes alveolar flap   [ɾ]  between  sonorant  segments, such as between two  vowels .  Phonetic rules, mostly  assimilation , transform the pronunciation of some words. For example,       Jong l o  is pronounced as  Jong n o     Han k u k mal  as  Han- g u ng mal     Stop consonants are generally voiceless, but lightly aspirated stops become voiced and unaspirated in intervocalic position. For example,     p -> b   t -> d   k -> g    Stops are nasalized before a nasal. For example,     p -> m (before m, n, or ng)   t -> n (before m, n, or ng)   k -> ng (before m, n, or ng)    Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying  morphology .  One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial   [r]  (also the initial   [n]  before   [i]  or   [y] ). For example,     勞動 north:  r odong , south:  n odong  (labour)   歷史 north:  ry ŏksa , south:  y eoksa  (history)   女子 north:  ny ŏja , south:  y eoja  (lady)    Vowel harmony   Traditionally, the Korean language has had strong  vowel harmony ; that is, in pre-modern Korean, as in most Altaic languages, not only did the inflectional and derivational affixes (such as  postpositions ) change in accordance to the main root vowel, but native words also adhered to vowel harmony.  It is not as prevalent in modern usage, although it remains strong in  onomatopoeia ,  adjectives  and  adverbs ,  interjections , and  conjugation . There are also other traces of vowel harmony in Korean.           Korean Vowel Harmony       Positive/Yang Vowels   ㅏ (a)   ㅑ (ya)   ㅗ (o)   ㅛ (yo)         ㅐ (ae)   ㅘ (wa)   ㅚ (oe)   ㅙ (wae)       Negative/Yin Vowels   ㅓ (eo)   ㅕ (yeo)   ㅜ (u)   ㅠ (yu)         ㅔ (e)   ㅝ (weo)   ㅟ (wi)   ㅞ (we)       Neutral/Centre Vowels   ㅡ (eu)   ㅣ (i)   ㅢ (eui)      There are three classes of vowels in Korean: positive, negative, and neutral. The vowel ŭ is considered partially a neutral and negative vowel. The vowel classes loosely follow the mid (negative) and front (positive) vowels; they also follow orthography. Exchanging positive vowels with negative vowels usually creates different nuances of meaning.    Examples   Onomatopoeia:   퐁당퐁당 (pong-dang-pong-dang)  풍덩풍덩 (pung-deong-pung-deong) (Water splashing)    Adjectives/Adverbs:   무럭무럭 (mureokmureok) and 모락모락 (morakmorak) can both be translated as ""rapidly"" or ""densely"", but each has different connotations:  연기가 모락모락 나다 ( yeonggiga morakmorak nada ) Smoke rises up.  나무가 무럭무럭 자란다 ( Namuga mureokmureok jaranda ) The tree grows well.       Emphasised Adjectives:   노랗다 (noratta) means plain yellow, while its negative, 누렇다 (nureotta) means very yellow  파랗다 (paratta) means plain blue, while its negative, 퍼렇다 (peoreota) means deep blue    Particles at the end of verbs:   잡다 (Japda) (to catch) → 잡았다 (Jabatda) (caught)  접다 (Jeopda) (to fold) → 접었다 (Jeobeotda) (folded)    Interjections:   아이고 (Aigo) and 어이구 (Eoigu) meaning ""oh my!""  어허 (Eoheo) and 아하 (Aha) meaning ""indeed"" and ""well"" respectively      Grammar   Korean is an  agglutinative language . The basic form of a Korean sentence is Subject-Object-Verb ( SOV ), and modifiers precede the modified word. As a side note, a sentence can break the SOV wor  "

More specifically, it refers to those Chinese characters borrowed from  Chinese  and incorporated into the  Korean language  with Korean  phonetics .  Hanja-mal  or  hanja-eo  refers to words which can be written with hanja, and  hanmun  (  ,   ) refers to  Classical Chinese  writing, although ""hanja"" is sometimes used loosely to encompass these other concepts. Because hanja never underwent major reform, they are almost entirely identical to  traditional Chinese  and  kyjitai  characters. Only a small number of hanja characters are modified or unique to Korean. By contrast, many of the Chinese characters currently in use in Japanese ( kanji ) and Simplified Chinese (not the Traditional Chinese) have been simplified, and contain fewer strokes than the corresponding hanja characters.   Although a phonetic Korean alphabet, now known as  hangul , had been created by a team of scholars commissioned in the 1440s by  King Sejong , it did not come into widespread use until the late 19th and early 20th century. Thus, until that time it was necessary to be fluent in reading and writing hanja in order to be literate in Korean, as the vast majority of Korean literature and most other Korean documents were written in hanja. Today, hanja plays a different role. Scholars who wish to study Korean history must study hanja in order to read historical documents. For the general public, learning a certain number of hanja is very helpful in understanding words that are formed with them. Hanja are not used to write native Korean words, which are always rendered in hangul, and even words of Chinese origin   hanja-eo  (, )  are written with the hangul alphabet most of the time.

Please help  improve this section  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (February 2008)       A major impetus for the introduction of  Chinese characters  into  Korea  was the spread of  Buddhism . The major Chinese text that introduced hanja to Koreans, however, was not a religious text but the Chinese text,  Cheonjamun  ( Thousand Character Classic ).   Koreans had to learn  Classical Chinese  to be properly literate for the most part, but there were some systems developed to use simplified forms of Chinese characters that  phonetically  transcribe Korean, namely,  hyangchal  (; ),  gugyeol  (; ), and  idu  (; ).   One way of adapting hanja to write Korean in such systems (such as Gugyeol) was to represent native Korean  grammatical particles  and other words solely according to their pronunciation. For example, Gugyeol uses the characters  to transcribe the Korean word ""hni"", in modern Korean, that means ""does, and so"". However, in Chinese, the same characters are read as the expression ""wi n,"" meaning ""becoming a nun."" This is a typical example of Gugyeol words where the radical () is read in Korean for its meaning (h  ""to do"") and the suffix , ni (meaning 'nun'), used phonetically.   Hanja was the sole means of writing Korean until  King Sejong the Great  promoted the invention of  hangul  in the 15th century. However, even after the invention of hangul, most Korean scholars continued to write in hanmun.   It was not until the 20th century that hangul truly replaced hanja. Officially, hanja has not been used in  North Korea  since June 1949 (additionally, all texts are now written horizontally instead of vertically), because  Kim Il-sung  considered it an artifact of  Japanese occupation  and an impediment to literacy. [ citation needed ]   Additionally, many words borrowed from Chinese have been replaced in the North with native Korean words. However, there are a large number of Chinese-borrowed words in widespread usage in the North (although written in hangul), and hanja characters still appear in special contexts, such as recent North Korean dictionaries  [1] .     [ edit ]   Character formation   Each hanja is composed of one of 214  radicals  plus in most cases one or more additional elements. The vast majority of hanja use the additional elements to indicate the sound of the character, but a few hanja are purely pictographic, and some were formed in other ways.     [ edit ]   Eumhun  (sound and meaning)   To aid in understanding the meaning of a character, or to describe it orally to distinguish it from other characters with the same pronunciation, character dictionaries and school textbooks refer to each character with a combination of its sound and a word indicating its meaning. This dual meaning-sound reading of a character is called  eumhun  (; ; from  ""sound"" +  ""meaning,"" ""teaching"").   For example, the character  (love) is referred to in character dictionaries as  sarang ae  ( ), where  sarang  is the native Korean word for ""love"" (the character's meaning) and  ae  is its sound. Similarly, the character  (person) is read as referred to as  saram in  ( ), where ""saram"" means ""person"" and ""in"" is its sound. When these two example characters are put together to form the word , they are simply read as  aein  (), and denote the idea of a beloved or sweetheart (""love"" + ""person"").   The word or words used to denote the meaning are oftenthough hardly alwayswords of native Korean (i.e., non-Chinese) origin, and are sometimes archaic words no longer commonly used. For example, the character  (mountain) is referred to as  me san  or  moe san  (, pronounced ""meh sahn""; or , pronounced ""moeh sahn""), where  me  or  moe  is an archaic word for ""mountain,"" almost entirely supplanted by the Chinese-derived word  san.     [ edit ]   Education   Hanja are still taught in separate courses in  South Korean high schools , apart from the normal Korean language curriculum. Formal hanja education begins in grade 7 (junior high school) and continues until graduation from senior high school in grade 12. A total of 1,800 hanja are taught: 900 for junior high, and 900 for senior high (starting in grade 10). [ 1 ]  Post-secondary hanja education continues in some  liberal arts   universities . [ 2 ]  The 1972 promulgation of basic hanja for educational purposes was altered in  December 31 ,  2000 , to replace 44 hanja with 44 others. [ citation needed ]  The choice of characters to eliminate and exclude caused heated debates prior to and after the 2000 promulgation. [ citation needed ]   Though North Korea rapidly abandoned the general use of hanja soon after independence, [ 3 ]  the number of hanja actually taught in primary and secondary schools is greater than the 1,800 taught in South Korea. [ 4 ]   Kim Il-sung  had earlier called for a gradual elimination of the use of hanja, [ 5 ]  but by the 1960s, he had reversed his stance; he was quoted as saying in 1966, ""While we should use as few Sinitic terms as possible, students must be exposed to the necessary Chinese characters and taught how to write them."" [ 6 ]  As a result, a Chinese-character textbook was designed for North Korean schools for use in grades 5-9, teaching 1,500 characters, with another 500 for high school students. [ 7 ]  College students are exposed to another 1,000, bringing the total to 3,000. [ 8 ]   In Korean language and Korean studies programs at universities around the world, a sample of hanja is typically a requirement for students. [ citation needed ]  Becoming a  graduate student  in these fields usually requires students to learn at least the 1,800 basic hanja. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Current uses of hanja   Because many different hanjaand thus, many different words written using hanjaoften share the same sounds, two distinct hanja words ( hanjaeo ) may be spelled identically in the phonetic hangul alphabet. Thus, hanja are often used to clarify meaning, either on their own without the equivalent hangul spelling, or in parentheses after the hangul spelling as a kind of gloss. Hanja are often also used as a form of shorthand in newspaper headlines, advertisements, and on signs. Some details of use follow.     [ edit ]   Hanja in print media   In South Korea, hanja are used most frequently in academic literature, where they often appear without the equivalent hangul spelling. [ citation needed ]  Usually, only those words with a specialized or ambiguous meaning are printed in hanja. [ citation needed ]  In mass-circulation books and magazines, hanja are generally used rarely, and only to gloss words already spelled in hangul when the meaning is ambiguous. [ citation needed ]  Hanja are also often used in newspaper headlines as abbreviations or to eliminate the ambiguity typical of newspaper headlines in any language. [ 9 ]  In formal publications, personal names are also usually glossed in hanja in parentheses next to the hangul. In contrast, North Korea eliminated the use of hanja even in academic publications by 1949, a situation which has since remained unchanged. [ 6 ]  Hanja are often used for advertising or decorative purposes, and appear frequently in athletic events and cultural parades, dictionaries and atlases; see below. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Hanja in dictionaries   In modern Korean dictionaries, all entry words of Sino-Korean origin are printed in hangul and listed in hangul order, with the hanja given in parentheses immediately following the entry word.   This practice helps to eliminate ambiguity, and it also serves as a sort of shorthand etymology, since the meaning of the hanja and the fact that the word is composed of hanja often help to illustrate the word's origin.   As an example of how hanja can help to clear up ambiguity, many homophones are written in hangul as  (sudo), including:       spiritual discipline     receipt and delivery     prisoner     'city of water' (e.g.  Hong Kong  and  Naples )      rice     drain      tunnel     capital (city)     hand-knife     Hanja dictionaries ( Jajeon  (, ) or  Okpyeon  (, )) are organized by  radicals , like  hanzi  (Chinese, ) and  kanji  (Japanese, ).     [ edit ]   Hanja in personal names   Korean personal names  are generally based on hanja, although some exceptions exist. On business cards, the use of hanja is slowly fading away, with most older people displaying their names in hanja while most of the younger generation utilizes  Hangul . Korean personal names usually consist of a one-character family name (seong, , ) followed by a two-character given name (ireum, ). There are a few 2-character family names (eg , Namgung), and the holders of such names  but not only them  tend to have one-syllable given names. Traditionally, the given name in turn consists of one character unique to the individual and one character shared by all people in a family of the same sex and generation (see  Generation name ). Things have changed, however, and while these rules are still largely followed, some people have given names that are native Korean words (popular ones include ""Haneul""  meaning ""sky""  and ""Iseul""  meaning ""morning dew""). Nevertheless, on official documents, people's names are still recorded in both hangul and in hanja (if the name is composed of hanja).     [ edit ]   Hanja in place names   Due to standardization efforts during  Goryeo  and  Joseon  eras, native Korean  placenames  were converted to hanja, and most names used today are hanja-based. The most notable exception is the name of the capital,  Seoul - although Seoul is the English pronunciation of  (Seo-Oon) which literally mean 'Capital'. Disyllabic names of railway lines, freeways, and provinces are often formed by taking one character from each of the two locales' names. For Seoul, the abbreviation is the hanja  gyeong  (, ""capital""). Thus,     The  Gyeongbu  () corridor connects Seoul ( gyeong ) with  Busan  ( bu );   The  Gyeongin  () corridor connects Seoul with  Incheon  ( in );   The former  Jeolla  () Province took its name from the first characters in the city names  Jeonju  () and  Naju  () (""Naju"" is originally ""Raju,"" but the initial ""r/l"" sound in South Korean is simplified to ""n"").     Most atlases of Korea today are published in two versions: one in hangul (sometimes with some English as well), and one in hanja. Subway and railway station signs give the station's name in hangul, hanja, and English, both to assist visitors and to disambiguate the name.     [ edit ]   Hanja usage     See also:  Korean mixed script     Opinion surveys show that the South Korean public do not consider hanja literacy essential, a situation attributed to the fact that hanja education in South Korea does not begin until the seventh year of schooling. [ 10 ]  Hanja terms are also expressed through  hangul , the standard script in the Korean language. Some studies suggest that hanja use appears to be in decline. In 1956, one study found mixed-script Korean text (in which  Sino-Korean  nouns are written using hanja, and other words using hangul) were read faster than texts written purely in hangul; however, by 1977, the situation had reversed. [ 11 ]  In 1988, 80% of one sample of people without a college education ""evinced no reading comprehension of any but the simplest, most common hanja"" when reading mixed-script passages. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Korean hanja   A small number of characters were invented by Koreans themselves. Most of them are for proper names (place-names and people's names) but some refer to Korean-specific concepts and materials. They include  ( ;  non dap ; ""paddyfield""),  ( Dol , a character only used in given names),  ( So , a rare surname from  Seongju ), and  ( Gi , an old name of the  Kumgangsan ).   Some hanja characters have simplified forms  (yakja )  that can be seen in casual use. An example is  , which is a cursive form of . Some of them are similar to Japanese  shinjitai  (new character forms).     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   Each hanja character is pronounced as a single syllable, corresponding to a single composite character in hangul. The  pronunciation  of hanja in Korean is not identical to the way they are pronounced in Chinese, particularly  Mandarin , although some Chinese dialects and Korean share similar pronunciations for some characters. For example,  ""print"" is  ynshu  in Mandarin Chinese and  inswae  () in Korean, but it is pronounced  insue  in  Shanghainese  (a  Wu Chinese  dialect). One obvious difference is the complete loss of  tone  from Korean while all Chinese dialects retain tone. In other aspects, the pronunciation of hanja is more conservative than most Chinese dialects, for example in the retention of  labial consonant   codas  in characters with  labial consonant   onsets , such as the characters  (  beop ) and  (  beom ); the labial codas existed in  Middle Chinese  but do not survive intact in most Chinese varieties today, including conservative southern varieties like  Cantonese  (becoming  faht  and  faan  respectively) and  Min .   Due to divergence in pronunciation since the time of borrowing, sometimes the pronunciation of a hanja and its corresponding hanzi may differ considerably. For example,  (""woman"") is  n  in Mandarin Chinese and  nyeo  () in Korean. However, in most modern Korean dialects (especially  South Korean  ones),  is pronounced as  yeo  () when used in an initial position, due to a systematic displacement of initial  n' s followed by  y  or  i .   Additionally, sometimes a hanja-derived word will have altered pronunciation of a character to reflect Korean pronunciation shifts, for example mogwa   ""quince"" from mokgwa .

There are many theories to differentiate the Korean language histories  [ 2 ] ,  [ 3 ] ,  [ 4 ] ,  [ 5 ] ,  [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ,  [ 8 ] ,  [ 9 ] . It is distinct from  Proto-Korean  ( ), which is the reconstructed language from which Korean is hypothesized to have evolved. However, there is controversy whether Korean language actually has been separated from Altaic language. Old Korean may have been a  tonal language , although this has not been clearly established. [ 10 ]  The old Korean languages are divided into two. It is assumed that the Sillan dialect has its roots to middle and modern Korean, while the Buyeo language, spoken by Goguryeo and Baekje and other Korean states before the Three kingdoms period and the ones that co-existed in the era has similarities with the Sillan dialect.   Only some literary records of Unified Silla, changed into Goryeo text, are extant and some texts (written in their native Writing system) of the Three kingdoms period are mostly available in form of inscriptions at present. Thus, the languages of the Three Kingdoms period are generally examined through official government names and local district names. The point at which Old Korean became  Middle Korean  is assessed variously by different scholars. The line is sometimes drawn in the late Goryeo dynasty, and sometimes around the 15th century in the early  Joseon Dynasty . But it is usually thought that Middle Korea started at the establishment of Goryeo, and the standard language of Old Korean was changed from the Silla dialect to the Goryeo dialect.

The first texts in Old Korean date from the  Three Kingdoms  period. They are written using Chinese characters to represent the sound and grammar of the native language. Various systems were used, beginning with  ad hoc  approaches and gradually becoming codified in the scribal  idu  system and the  hyangchal  system used for poetry.   Additional information about the language is drawn from various proper nouns recorded in Korean and Chinese records, and from etymological studies of the Korean pronunciations of Chinese characters, which are believed to have been first adapted into Korean in the late Three Kingdoms period.     [ edit ]   Writing system   Chinese script  was borrowed to represent the sound. Some [ who? ]  say that another writing system existed such as  Gugyeol , but Gugyeol was only a system of phonetic symbols for the Chinese script.     [ edit ]   Languages   In the age of Three Kingdoms, it has not been definitely proven that the three kingdoms all used the same language, but it is accepted by many scholars that the Three Kingdoms utilized similar languages, and that these may have been dialects of a single language [ 11 ] .

An elliptical narrative starting with a traditional memorial on the anniversary of a Mothers' death and ending with a similar gathering commemorating the deceased Fathers' birthday one month later.   The purposeful confusion, on which three sisters stories are branching and expanding in paced detail, is easily muted in the viewers mind by the overwhelming visual splendor that just keeps blossoming on screen. This visual symphony of art is backed by a lilting traditional score by Ton That Tiet and the beautiful Vietnamese folk music of Trinh Cong San.           Each scene seems to overflow with beauty, whether in the surrounding environment with its crisp chirping sounds of birds, insects, rain or the unique art objects that adorn many of the households that we enter into. It is so easy to get sensual comfort from this film, that the details, which at times can be hazy, are all secondary. When they become clearer, as the film progresses, we then realize how close we have become to its characters .     From            Gary         W.

The Artificial Eye DVD looks very hazy in comparison. The R2 does have         the nice ""Making of Documentary"", subtitled in English. The         Artificial Eye disc has less chapters and burned in sub-titles. The R1's better image quality is the sole reason to stick with         the R1 for this piece of classic art cinema, but true fans will want to         see the documentary and might want to get both versions.

Sun Liang  (243260) was an  emperor  of  Eastern Wu  during the  Three Kingdoms period . He was the founding emperor  Sun Quan 's youngest son and heir. He is also known as the  Prince of Kuaiji  () or (less frequently)  Marquess of Houguan  (), which were his successive titles after his removal in 258 by the regent  Sun Lin  following his failed attempt to remove Sun Lin from power. He was succeeded by his brother  Sun Xiu , who was successful in having Sun Lin killed. Two years after Sun Liang's removal, he was falsely accused of treason and demoted to marquess, and he committed suicide.

As Sun Quan's youngest son, he was well-cared for by his father, who was very happy to have a son in his old age (61 at the time of Sun Liang's birth). He was also born into a palace atmosphere where officials were aligning themselves with either of his two older brothers who were fighting for supremacy --  Sun He  the  crown prince  and Sun Ba () the Prince of Lu, who had designs on the position. In 250, fed up with Prince Ba's constant attacks against Crown Prince He, Sun Quan inexplicably ordered Prince Ba to commit suicide and deposed Crown Prince He. At the urging of his daughter Sun Dahu (), who had been involved with falsely accusing Crown Prince He and his mother Consort Wang of crimes and therefore wanted to see Crown Prince He removed, he created Prince Liang as the new crown prince. Princess Dahu then had Crown Prince Liang married to a grand niece of her husband Quan Cong (). In 251, Sun Quan created Crown Prince Liang's mother Consort Pan  empress .   In 252, Crown Prince Liang would lose both of his parents in rapid succession. Early that year, Empress Pan was murdered -- but how she was murdered remains a controversy. Eastern Wu officials claimed that her servants, unable to stand her temper, strangled her while she was asleep, while a number of historians, including  Hu Sansheng , the commentator to  Sima Guang 's  Zizhi Tongjian , believed that top Eastern Wu officials were complicit, as they feared that she would seize power as  empress dowager  after Sun Quan's death. Later that year, Sun Quan died, and Crown Prince Liang succeeded to the throne.     [ edit ]   Reign     [ edit ]   Zhuge Ke's regency   Prior to his death, Sun Quan had selected  Zhuge Jin 's son  Zhuge Ke  as the  regent  for Sun Liang, at the endorsement of his trusted assistant  Sun Jun  (a great-grandson of his uncle Sun Jing ()). The people of the empire also greatly admired Zhuge Ke, as he was already known for his military and diplomatic successes involving the indigenous  Yue  and for his quick wit. However, Sun's only reservation -- that Zhuge was arrogant and had overly high opinion of his own abilities -- would turn out to be prophetic.   In 252, in light of Sun Quan's death,  Cao Wei 's regent  Sima Shi  made a major three-pronged attack against Eastern Wu. Zhuge's forces, however, were able to defeat the main Cao Wei force, inflicting heavy losses. Zhuge's reputation became even more established. In 253, he carried out a plan he had for a while -- to gather up nearly all service-eligible young men of Eastern Wu to make a major attack against Cao Wei -- despite opposition by a number of other officials. He further coordinated his attack with ally  Shu Han 's regent  Jiang Wei . However, his strategy turned out to be faulty -- as he was initially targeting Shouchun (, in modern  Lu'an ,  Anhui ) but, on his way, changed his mind and attack  Hefei  instead, despite the fact that Hefei's defenses were strong and intended to withstand major Eastern Wu attacks. Zhuge's forces became worn out by the long-term siege and suffered plagues -- which Zhuge ignored. He eventually withdrew after Cao Wei reinforcements arrived, but instead of returning to the capital  Jianye  (modern  Nanjing ) and apologize for his erroneous strategies, he remained from the capital for some time and never apologized to the people for the heavy losses suffered.   When Zhuge eventually did return to Jianye, he further sternly tried to wipe out all dissent, punishing all those who disagreed with him. He further planned another attack against Cao Wei, disregarding the recent heavy losses the people had suffered and their resentment. Sun Jun decided that he had to kill Zhuge. He told Sun Liang that Zhuge was planning treason, and he set up a trap at the imperial feast for Zhuge. (How much the young emperor knew of Sun Jun's plans and whether he concurred is unclear; traditional historians implied that Sun Liang knew and concurred, but he was just 10 years old at this point.) During the middle of the feast, assassins that Sun Jun had arranged for killed Zhuge, and Sun Jun's forces then wiped out the Zhuge clan.     [ edit ]   Sun Jun's regency   After Sun Jun killed Zhuge Ke, he quickly moved to consolidate his power. He initially, on the surface, shared power with the prime minister Teng Yin (), but he, with control of the military, soon became even more dictatorial than Zhuge. In particular, he falsely accused the former crown prince Sun He of conspiring with Zhuge, and forced Sun He to commit suicide. His autocratic actions led to a conspiracy between Sun Ying () the Marquess of Wu (the son of Sun Quan's first crown prince Sun Deng ()) and the army officer Huan L (), but he discovered the plan in 254, and both Sun Ying and Huan were executed.   In 255, in the midst of Cao Wei's having to deal with a rebellion by  Guanqiu Jian  and Wen Qin (), Eastern Wu forces, led by Sun Jun, tried to attack Cao Wei's border region, but withdrew after Sima Shi quickly put down the rebellion. (Wen and his troops did surrender to him after they were defeated.) Later that year, another plot against Sun Jun was discovered, and a large number of officers were executed, along with Sun Quan's daughter Sun Xiaohu (), falsely implicated by her sister Princess Dahu.   In 256, Sun Jun, at Wen's urging, was planning an attack against Cao Wei, when he suddenly fell ill, and he commissioned his cousin  Sun Lin  to succeed him as regent and died soon after.     [ edit ]   Sun Lin's regency   Sun Jun's death would precipitate a major confrontation. The general L Ju (), who was set to lead the main force against Cao Wei, was angry that the autocratic Sun Jun appointed Sun Lin, who up to that point had not shown himself distinguished in any way. L openly called for Teng to become regent instead, and Teng agreed to act with him. Sun Lin struck back militarily, and his forces defeated Teng's and L's. Teng and his clan were executed, while L committed suicide. In light of his defeat of Teng and L, Sun Lin began to become extremely arrogant.   In 257, at the age of 14, Sun Liang began to personally handle some important matters of state. He established a personal guard corps, consistent of young men and officers with age similar to his, stating that he intended to grow up with them. He also sometimes questioned Sun Lin's decisions. Sun Lin began to be somewhat apprehensive of the young emperor.   Later that year, Cao Wei's general  Zhuge Dan , believing that the Cao Wei regent  Sima Zhao  (Sima Shi's brother) was about to usurp the throne, declared a rebellion and requested Eastern Wu assistance. A small Eastern Wu detachment, led by Wen, quickly arrived to assist him, but Sun Lin led the main forces and chose to camp a long distance away from Shouchun, where Zhuge was being sieged by Sima, and did nothing. When Sun Lin instead ordered the general Zhu Yi to try to relieve Shouchun with tired and unfed troops, Zhu refused -- and Sun Lin executed him, bringing anger from the people, who had admired Zhu's military skills and integrity. With Sun Lin unable to do anything, Zhuge's rebellion failed in 258, and Wen's troops became captives of Cao Wei.     [ edit ]   Removal   Sun Lin knew that the people and the young emperor were both angry at him, and chose not to return to Jianye, but instead sent his confidants to be in charge of the capital's defenses. Sun Liang became angrier, and plotted with Princess Dahu, the general Liu Cheng (), his father-in-law Quan Shang (), and his brother-in-law Quan Ji (), to have Sun Lin overthrown. However, Quan Shang did not keep the plot secret from his wife, who was Sun Lin's cousin, and she told Sun Lin. Sun Lin quickly captured Quan Shang and killed Liu, and then surrounded the palace and forced the other officials to agree to depose Sun Liang -- falsely declaring to the people that Sun Liang had suffered psychosis. Sun Liang was demoted to the title of the Prince of Kuaiji.     [ edit ]   After removal   Sun Lin then made Sun Liang's older brother  Sun Xiu , the Prince of Langye, emperor. Several months later, Sun Xiu set a trap for Sun Lin and had him arrested and killed. However, Sun Liang's position in exile did not become any safer, as Sun Xiu deeply feared that there would be plots to return Sun Liang to the throne. In 260, there were rumors that Sun Liang would be emperor again, and Sun Liang's servant girls falsely accused him of employing witchcraft. Sun Xiu demoted Sun Liang to the title of the Marquess of Houguan, and sent him to his  march  (in modern  Fuzhou ,  Fujian , then considered in deep wilderness). On the way, Sun Liang died -- and while most historians believe that he committed suicide, an alternative theory is that Sun Xiu had him poisoned.

Sun Wukong  ( traditional Chinese :     ;  simplified Chinese :     ;  pinyin :  Sn Wkng ;  Wade-Giles : Sun 1  Wu 4 -k'ung 1 ; Japanese   ( Son Gok ? ) ), known in the West as the  Monkey King , is the main character in the classical  Chinese  epic novel  Journey to the West . In the novel, he accompanies the monk  Xuanzang  on the journey to retrieve  Buddhist   sutras  from  India .   Sun Wukong possesses incredible strength, being able to lift his 13,500  jn  (8,100 kg)  Ruyi Jingu Bang  with ease. He also has superb speed, traveling 108,000  li  (54,000  kilometers ) in one somersault. Sun knows 72 transformations, which allows him to transform into various animals and objects; he is, however, shown with slight problems transforming into other people, since he is unable to complete the transformation of his  tail . He is a skilled fighter, capable of holding his own against the best generals of heaven. Each of his hairs possesses magical properties, and is capable of transforming into a  clone  of the Monkey King himself, or various weapons, animals, and other objects. He also knows various spells in order to command  wind , part  water , conjure protective circles against  demons , freeze humans, demons, and gods alike.

After joining a clan of monkeys, he earned their respect by discovering the  Shulin-dng  (Chinese:  water-curtain cave ) behind a large waterfall; the clan made it their new home. The other monkeys honored him as their king, and he called himself  Mi Huwng  ( handsome monkey king ). However, he soon realized that despite his power over the monkeys, he was just like them, and was not beyond mortality. Determined to find immortality, he traveled on a raft to civilized lands, where he found and became the disciple of a  Buddhist / Taoist  Patriarch  Bodhi . He was able to acquire human speech and manners through his travels. [ 1 ]   Bodhi was initially reluctant to take him because he was not human, but the monkey's determination and perseverance impressed the patriarch. It was from him that the monkey received his official name  Sun Wukong  (""Sun"" implies his origin as a monkey, and ""Wukong"" means  aware of  emptiness ). Soon, his eagerness and intelligence made him one of the favorite disciples of the patriarch, whose guidance and training taught the monkey a number of magic arts. He acquired the powers of  shapeshifting  known as the ""72 transformations"", supposedly the more versatile and difficult set of skills that allows him to transform into every possible form of existence, including people and objects. He also learned about  cloud-traveling , including a technique called the  Jnduyn  ( cloud-somersault ), which covers 108,000  li  (54,000 km) in a single flip. Finally, he could transform each of the 84,000 hairs on his body into inanimate objects and living beings, or even clones of himself. Sun Wukong became proud of his abilities, and began boasting to the other disciples. Bodhi was not happy with this, and cast him out of his temple. Before they parted ways, Bodhi made Wukong promise never to tell anyone how he acquired his powers. [ 1 ]   Back at  Hugu-shn , Wukong established himself as one of the most powerful and influential demons in the world. In search of a weapon worthy of himself, Sun Wukong traveled into the oceans, where he acquired the ""As-you-will Golden-banded  Cudgel "", known as  Ruyi Jingu Bang  (also known as  Lork bong Jin Jan  in Khmer), which could change its size, multiply itself, and fight according to the whim of its master. It was originally used by  D-Y  to measure ocean depth and later became the ""Pillar that pacifies the oceans"", a treasure of  Ao Guang , the "" dragon-king  of the Eastern Seas"". It weighed 13,500  jin  (8.1 tons). Upon Wukong's approach, the pillar started to glow, signifying that it had finally found its true master. Its versatility meant that Wukong could wield it as a staff and keep it inside his ear as a sewing needle. This drove fear into the magical beings of the sea and threw the sea itself into confusion, since nothing but the pillar itself could control the ebb and flow of the ocean's tides. In addition to taking the magical staff, Wukong also defeated the dragons of the four seas in battle and forced them to give him their best magical armor: a golden chain mail (), a phoenix-feather cap (  Fngchzjingun ), and cloud-walking boots (  usbynl ). Sun Wukong then defied Hell's attempt to collect his soul. Instead of reincarnating like all other living beings, he not only wiped his name out of the ""Book of Life and Death"", but also scraped out the names of all the other monkeys known to him. The Dragon Kings and the Kings of Hell decided to report him to the  Jade Emperor  of Heaven. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Havoc in the Heavenly Kingdom          Sun Wukong as depicted in a scene in a Beijing opera       Hoping that a promotion and a rank amongst the gods would make him more manageable, the  Jade Emperor  invited Wukong to Heaven, where the monkey believed he would receive an honorable place as one of the gods. Instead, he was made the head of Heavenly Stables to watch over horses. When he discovered this, Wukong rebelled and proclaimed himself the ""Great Sage, Equal of Heaven"", and allied with some of the most powerful demons on earth. The Heavens' initial attempt at subduing the monkey king was unsuccessful; although they were forced to recognize his title, however, they attempted to put him off as the guardian of Heavenly Garden. When he found that he was excluded from a royal banquet that included every other important god and goddess, Wukong's indignation again turned to open defiance. After stealing the empress  Xi Wangmu 's ""peaches of immortality"",  Lao Tzu 's ""pills of longevity"", and the  Jade Emperor 's royal wine, he escaped back to his kingdom in preparation for his rebellion.   Wukong later defeated the Army of Heaven's 100,000 celestial warriors - each fight an equivalent of a cosmic embodiment, including all 28 constellations, four  heavenly kings , and  Nezha  - and finally proved himself equal to the best of Heaven's generals,  Erlang Shen . Eventually, through the teamwork of Taoist and Buddhist forces, including the efforts from some of the greatest deities, Wukong was captured. After several failed attempts at execution, Wukong was locked into  Lao Tzu 's  eight-way trigram  cauldron to be distilled into an elixir by the most sacred and the most severe samadhi fires. However, after 49 days, the cauldron exploded and Wukong jumped out, stronger than ever. He now had the ability to recognize evil in any form, through his  huyn-jnjng  () (lit. ""fiery-eyes golden-gaze""), an eye condition that also gave him a weakness to smoke.   With all of their options exhausted, the Jade Emperor and the authorities of Heaven appealed to the  Buddha , who arrived from his temple in the West. The Buddha made a bet with Wukong that he could not escape from his palm. Wukong, knowing that he could cover 108,000  li  in one leap, smugly agreed. He took a great leap and then flew to the end of the world in seconds. Nothing was visible except for five pillars, and Wukong surmised that he had reached the ends of Heaven. To prove his trail, he marked the pillars. Afterwards, he leaped back and landed in Buddha's palm. There, he was surprised to find that the five ""pillars"" he had found were in fact the five fingers of the Buddha's hand. When Wukong tried to escape, Buddha turned his hand into a mountain. Before Wukong could shrug it off, Buddha sealed him there using a strip of paper with the  mantra   Om Mani Padme Hum  written thereon in gold letters, and Wukong remained imprisoned for five centuries. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Disciple to Xuanzang   Five centuries later, the  bodhisattva   Guanyin  went out in search for disciples that could protect a pilgrim from the East to journey to India to retrieve the Buddhist  sutras . In hearing this, Sun Wukong offered to serve this pilgrim, who turned out to be  Xuanzang , a monk of the  Tang Dynasty  Empire, in exchange for his freedom.  Guanyin  understood that the monkey would be hard to control, and therefore gave  Xuanzang  a gift from the Buddha: a magical headband which, once Wukong was tricked into putting it on, could never be removed. With a special chant, the band would tighten and cause unbearable pain to the monkey's head. To be fair, she also gave Wukong three special hairs, which could be used in dire emergencies. Under Xuanzang's supervision, Wukong was allowed to journey to the West.   Throughout the epic  Journey to the West , Sun Wukong faithfully helped Xuanzang on his journey to  India . They were joined by ""Pigsy"" (  Zhu Bajie ) and ""Sandy"" (  Sha Wujing ), both of whom offered to accompany the priest in order to atone for their previous crimes. Even the priest's horse was in fact a  dragon  prince. Xuanzang's safety was constantly under threat from demons and other supernatural beings who believed that his flesh, once consumed, would bring them longevity, and Wukong often acted as his bodyguard. Wukong was given free access to the powers of Heaven to combat these threats. The group encountered a series of eighty-one tribulations before accomplishing their mission and returning safely to  China . Wukong was granted  Buddhahood  for his service and strength. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Miscellaneous     [ edit ]   Celebrations and festivals   The Sun Wukong festival is celebrated on the sixteenth day of the eighth  lunar month  on the  Chinese calendar . Festivals feature recreations of his ordeals such as  walking on a bed of coals  and climbing a ladder of knives.   In  Hong Kong  the festival is celebrated at the  Buddhist  Temple in  Sau Mau Ping , which contains a shrine to Sun Wukong.     [ edit ]   In politics   Mao Zedong  consistently used Sun Wukong as a role model, and often spoke about the good example of the Monkey King, citing ""his fearlessness in thinking, doing work, striving for the objective and extricating China from poverty."" [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Influence   In spite of their popularity (or perhaps because of it), legends regarding Sun Wukong have changed with the ebb and flow that is  Chinese culture . The tale with  Buddha  and the ""Pillars"" is a prime example, and did not appear until  Buddhism  was introduced to  China  during the  Han Dynasty . Various legends concerning Sun Wukong date back to before written  Chinese history . They tend to change and adapt to the most popular  Chinese religion  of a given era.     Some scholars believe that the character Sun Wukong was based on  Hanuman  ( Sanskrit :   ), the ""monkey god"") of  Hinduism  described in a book by the historical  Sanzang . Wukong became so well known in China that he was once (and still is) worshiped by some as a real god.   Jamie Hewlett and Damon Albarn's Chinese opera "" Monkey: Journey to the West "" is based on the legend of the Monkey King. They were subsequently commissioned by the  BBC  to produce a two minute animated film to promote their coverage of the  2008 Olympics  in  Beijing , which features the characters involved in various sporting activities.   There are some scholars who believe this character may be originated from the first disciple of  Xuan Zang ,  Shi Bantuo . [ 3 ]   Sun Wukong is so prominent in  Journey to the West  that the famous translation by  Arthur Waley  entitled  Monkey , leading to other versions of  Journey to the West  also being called  Monkey , such as the Japanese television show,  Monkey .   The phrase ""You burst out from a stone"" has become one of the common excuses used by Chinese parents when answering the ""where do babies come from"" question. [ citation needed ]   Sun Wukong is said to be the influence behind the creation of various  Monkey Kung Fu  styles. [ citation needed ]     In his book  The Shaolin Monastery  (2008),  Tel Aviv University  Prof. Meir Shahar claims that Sun influenced a legend concerning the origins of the  Shaolin  staff method. The legend takes place during the  Red Turban Rebellion  of the  Yuan Dynasty . Bandits lay siege to the monastery, but it is saved by a lowly kitchen worker wielding a long  fire poker  as a makeshift  staff . He leaps into the oven and emerges as a monstrous giant big enough to stand astride both  Mount Song  and the imperial fort atop Mount Shaoshi (which are five miles apart). The bandits flee when they behold this staff-wielding titan. The Shaolin monks later realize that the kitchen worker was none other than the Monastery's guardian deity,  Vajrapani , in disguise. Shahar compares the worker's transformation in the stove with Sun's time in  Laozi 's crucible, their use of the staff, and the fact that Sun and his weapon can both grow to gigantic proportions. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Names and titles   Sun Wukong is known as  Syun Ng Hung  in  Cantonese ,  Son Oh Gong  in  Korean ,  Tn Ng Khng  in  Vietnamese ,  Son Gok  in  Japanese  and  Sun Go Kong  in  Indonesian  (derived from  Hakka )  Hanuman Sun Wukong  in Cambodian   Listed in the order that they were acquired:     Sh Hu  ()   Meaning the ""Stone monkey"". This refers to his physical essence, being born from a piece of rock after millennia of incubation on the  Bloom Mountains /Flower-Fruit Mountain.   Mi Huwng  ()   Meaning ""Handsome Monkey-King"", or Houwang for short. The adjective  Mi  means ""beautiful, handsome, pretty""; it also means ""to be pleased with oneself"", referring to his ego.  Hu  (""monkey"") also highlights his ""naughty and impish"" character.   Sn Wkng  ()   The name given to him by his first master, Patriarch  Bodhi . The surname  Sn  was given as an in-joke about the monkey, as monkeys are also called  hsn  (), and can mean either a literal  or  a figurative ""monkey"" (or "" macaque ""). The surname  sn  () and the ""monkey""- sn  () only differs in that the latter carries an extra ""dog"" ( qun )  radical  to highlight that  refers to an animal. The given name  Wkng  means "" awakened to   emptiness "". This is translated into Japanese as  Son Gok .   Bmwn  ()   The title of the keeper of the Heavenly Horses, a  punning  of  bmwn  (; lit. ""avoiding the horses' plague""). A monkey was often put in a  stable  as people believed its presence could prevent the horses from catching illness. Sun Wukong was given this position by the  Jade Emperor  after his first intrusion into Heaven. He was promised that it was a good position to have, and that he, at least in this section, would be in the highest position. After discovering it was, in actuality, one of the lowest jobs in Heaven, he became angry, smashed the entire stable, set the horses free, and then quit. From then on, the title bmwn was used by his adversaries to mock him.   Qtin Dshng  ()   Meaning ""Great Sage, Equal of Heaven"". Wkng demanded this title from the Jade Emperor and was eventually granted it. This is translated into Japanese as  seiten-taisei  (""great sage"",  dshng  and  taisei , is a Chinese and Japanese honorific). The title originally holds no power, though it is officially a high rank. Later the title was granted the responsibility to guard the Heavenly Peach Garden, due to that many Heavenly Officials noticed that Sun Wukong had nothing to do.   Xngzh  ()   Meaning ""ascetic"", it refers to a wandering monk, a priest's servant, or a person engaged in performing religious austerities. Xuanzang calls Wukong  Sn-xngzh  when he accepts him as his companion. This is translated into Japanese as  gyja  (making him Son-gyja).   Du-zhnshng-f  ()   ""Battle-Mystic-Buddha"". Wukong was given this name once he ascended to buddhahood at the end of the Journey to the West. This name is mentioned during the Chinese Buddhist evening services, specifically during the eighty-eight Buddhas repentance.     In addition to the names used in the novel, the Monkey King has other names in different languages:     Ku-ch-thian  () in  Taiwanese  (Taiwan): ""Monkey, Equal of Heaven"".   Maa 5  lau 1  zing 1  () in  Cantonese  ( Hong Kong  and  Guangdong ): ""Monkey Imp"" (called by his enemies)   Saiten Taisei Son Goku  in  Japanese  ( Japan ): ""Great Sage Equal of Heaven""       [ edit ]   Appearances in other media   Sun Wukong has been a staple character in many forms of media from many East Asian countries, most famously the 1965 Chinese animated film  Havoc in Heaven .     [ edit ]   Film and television   Many actors including  Masaaki Sakai ,  Liu Xiao Ling Tong ,  Stephen Chow , Yueh Hua (of  Shaw Brothers  fame), and  Dicky Cheung  have portrayed Sun in films and television shows.  Jet Li  portrays the character in the 2008 movie  The Forbidden Kingdom , which condenses many of the elements of his character (his mischief, his playing havoc amongst the gods, his magical staff obtained from the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, and his three magical hairs) into a single narrative.   Sun was also portrayed in the 1983 NBC special  Big Bird in China . He was the guide of  Big Bird , Barkley, and their young friend, Xiao Foo, while they searched for  Feng Huang .   In 1985, filmmaker  Chris Columbus  wrote an early draft for the third Indiana Jones film (which eventually became  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  and focused on the  Holy Grail  instead), which featured the Monkey King. In Columbus' first draft Sun Wu Kung (as it is spelt there) is benevolent deity and god to a city of pygmies and apes in  Africa ; but in the second draft he is a villain. George Lucas eventually decided the character was too unrealistic  [ 5 ]  The script was leaked online in 1997, and many believed it was an early draft for the  fourth film  as the date was mistakenly printed as 1995. [ 6 ] .   In 1986 in was filmed Chinese serial Monkey King ( Xi you ji , directed by Jie Yang), which featured 25 episodes of length from 40 to 55 minutes. It tells story of Monkey king Sun Wukong from his birth from rock and sea through his journey.   The anime,  Saiyuki , portrayed the monkey king as Son Goku.  Kazuya Minekura , the author of the manga, took the legend and made alterations to appeal to a teenage audience.   The manga and anime series  Dragon Ball  was based on  Journey to the West , and the protagonist was named  Son Goku  (the Japanese way to pronounce the  kanji   Sun Wukong ). However, while Goku had a few items in his possession similar to the Monkey King (such as a somersault cloud and an extending magical staff), he appeared to be more human than monkey (he is later revealed to be a member of a race of monkey-tailed aliens called  Saiyans ), and his initial mischievous behavior stems from his youth and innocence, rather than from arrogance and sometimes outright malice.   The manga and anime  Love Hina  have both a chapter where characters play the  Journey to the West .     [ edit ]   Literature   Gene Luen Yang 's graphic novel  American Born Chinese , uses the legend of ""The Monkey King,"" as a major metaphor throughout the book. He uses the Monkey King's quest to be equal to a god to compare the feelings the main character, a Chinese immigrant, is having fitting in to American society.     [ edit ]   Video Games   Sun Wukong has also appeared as a playable character in numerous titles such as  Saiyuki: Journey West  and  Warriors Orochi 2 . It is notable that in the latter, he is an antagonist character (albeit along with  Himiko  certainly the least malevolent of them) since in this game he was freed not by  Xuanzang  but by  Taira Kiyomori , who he then felt obligated to support.

Founder and  Emperor  of  Eastern Wu       Born   182       Died   252 (aged 70)       Predecessor   Sun Ce       Successor   Sun Liang       Names       Simplified Chinese          Traditional Chinese          Pinyin   Sn Qun       Wade-Giles   Sun Chuan       Courtesy name   Zhngmu ()       Posthumous name   Dongwudadi ()       Era names     Huangwu ()  222229  Huanglong ()  229231  Jiahe ()  232238  Chiwu ()  238251  Taiyuan ()  251252  Shenfeng ()  252           This is a  Chinese name ; the  family name  is   Sun  () .     Sun Quan  ( traditional Chinese :   ;  simplified Chinese :   ;  pinyin : Sn Qun;  Wade-Giles : Sun Chuan) (182 - 252), son of  Sun Jian , courtesy name  Zhngmu  (), formally  Emperor Da of (Eastern) Wu  was the founder of  Eastern Wu , during the  Three Kingdoms  period, in  China . He ruled from 222 to 229 as  Wu  Wang  (King/Prince of Wu) and from 229 to 252 as Emperor of the Wu Dynasty.   In his youth Sun Quan spent time in his home county of Fuchun, and after his father's death in the early 190s, at various cities on the Lower  Yangtze River . His elder brother  Sun Ce  carved out a warlord state in the region, based on his own followers and a number of local clan allegiances. When Sun Ce was assassinated by the retainers of  Xu Gong , whom Sun Ce had killed in battle several years prior, in 200, the eighteen-year-old Sun Quan inherited the lands southeast of the  Yangtze River  from his brother. His administration proved to be relatively stable in those early years. Sun Jian and Sun Ce's most senior officers, such as  Zhou Yu ,  Zhang Zhao ,  Zhang Hong , and  Cheng Pu  remained loyal; in fact it was mentioned in  Romance of the Three Kingdoms  that Sun Ce had at his deathbed reminded Sun Quan that ""in internal matters, consult Zhang Zhao, in external matters, consult Zhou Yu."" Thus throughout the 200s Sun Quan under the tutelage of his able advisors continued to build up his strength along the Yangtze River. In early 207, his forces finally won complete victory over  Huang Zu , a military leader under  Liu Biao , who dominated the Middle Yangtze.   In winter of that year, the northern warlord  Cao Cao  led an army of some 200,000 to conquer south to complete the reunification of China. Two distinct factions emerged at his court on how to handle the situation. One, led by Zhang Zhao, urged surrender whilst the other, led by Zhou Yu and the young diplomat  Lu Su , opposed capitulation. In the finality, Sun Quan decided to oppose Cao Cao in the Middle Yangtze with his superior riverine forces. Allied with the refugee warlord  Liu Bei  and employing the combined strategies of  Zhou Yu  and  Huang Gai , they defeated Cao Cao decisively at the  Battle of Red Cliffs .   In 220,  Cao Pi , son of Cao Cao, seized the throne and proclaimed himself to be the  Emperor of China , ending the nominal rule of the  Han Dynasty . At first Sun Quan nominally served as a Cao Wei vassal with the Cao Wei-created title of Prince of Wu, but after Cao Pi demanded that he send his son  Sun Deng  as a hostage to the Cao Wei capital  Luoyang  and he refused, in 222, he declared himself independent by changing  era name . It was not until the year 229 that he formally declared himself to be  emperor .   Because of his skill in gathering important, honourable men to his cause, Sun Quan was able to delegate authority to capable figures. This primary strength served him well in gaining the support of the common people and surrounding himself with capable generals.   Sun Quan died in 252 at the age of 70. He enjoyed the longest reign among all the founders of the Three Kingdoms. He was succeeded as Emperor of Eastern Wu by his son  Sun Liang .

After his father's death in 191, he became the charge of his brother  Sun Ce . Sun has greenish-blue eyes and redish hair. As he grew up, he became an officer under his brother during his brother's conquest of the region south of the  Yangtze River . He was made a county magistrate in 196, at age 14, and continued to rise through the ranks as his brother gave him more and more important tasks.   The  Sanguo Zhi  records that Sun Quan's father  Sun Jian  was a descendant of  Sun Tzu , the great military strategist of the  Warring States  period. According to later tradition, Sun Quan was born on Sunzhou (""Sun Island"", later Wangzhou - ""King's Island""), an islet at the intersection of the  Fuchun River  and one of its tributaries. Local  folklore  relates a story about how Sun Quan's grandfather Sun Zhong was originally a melon farmer on the islet.     [ edit ]   As warlord after Sun Ce's death     [ edit ]   Prior to the Battle of Red Cliffs   Sun Ce was assassinated in 200 during a hunt. On his deathbed, he knew that his son was still too young to be considered a realistic heir, so he entrusted the 18-year-old Sun Quan to his faithful subordinates. Initially, Sun Quan mourned so greatly that he could do nothing, but at  Zhang Zhao 's behest, he changed into a general's clothing and set out to visit the commanderies under his brother's control. Many of Sun Ce's subordinates thought that Sun Quan was too young to sustain Sun Ce's domain and wanted to leave, but Zhang and  Zhou Yu  saw special qualities in the young man and chose to stay to serve Sun Quan.  Zhang Hong , whom Sun Ce had earlier sent as a liaison to the paramount warlord  Cao Cao , also returned from Cao's domain to assist Sun Quan. (At Zhang Hong's request, Cao, in the name of  Emperor Xian , commissioned Sun Quan as General Taolu (), a title that he would be known for a long time.) He listened carefully to his mother Lady Wu's encouraging words, and greatly trusted Zhang Zhao and Zhang Hong with regard to civilian affairs and Zhou,  Cheng Pu , and  L Fan  with regard to military matters. He also sought out talented young men to serve as his personal advisors, and it was around this time that he befriended  Lu Su  and  Zhuge Jin , who would later play prominent roles in his administration. Throughout this period and decades to come, Sun Quan's leadership would be characterized by his ability to find men of character and entrust important matters to him, and his ability to react swiftly to events.   For the next several years, Sun Quan was largely interested in first defending his realm against potential enemies, but he gradually sought to harass and weaken  Liu Biao 's key subordinate,  Huang Zu  (who controlled the northeastern region of Liu's domain) -- particularly because Huang had killed his father Sun Jian in battle. In 208, he was finally able to defeat Huang Zu and kill him in battle. Soon after, Liu Biao himself died while Cao Cao was preparing a major campaign to subjugate both Liu Biao and Sun Quan under his control, precipitating a major confrontation.     [ edit ]   Battle of Red Cliffs       Main article:  Battle of Red Cliffs       After Liu Biao's death, a succession struggle for his domain came into being, between his sons  Liu Qi  and younger son  Liu Cong , whom Liu Biao's second wife  Lady Cai  favored (because he had married her niece). After Huang's death, Liu Qi was therefore given Huang's post as the governor of Jiangxia Commandery (roughly modern  Huanggang ,  Hubei ). Liu Cong therefore succeeded Liu Biao after his death, and Liu Qi was displeased and considered, but did not carry out, an attack against his brother. Nevertheless, Liu Cong, in fear of having to fight Cao Cao and his brother on two fronts, surrendered to Cao Cao against the advice of Liu Biao's key ally  Liu Bei . Liu Bei, unwilling to submit to Cao Cao, fled south. Cao Cao caught up to him and crushed his forces, but Liu Bei escaped with his life; he fled to Dangyang (, in modern  Yichang ,  Hubei ). Cao Cao took over most of Jing Province, and appeared set on finally unifying the empire.   Sun Quan was well aware of Cao's intentions, and he quickly entered into an alliance with Liu Bei and Liu Qi to prepare for a Cao assault. Cao Cao wrote Sun with a letter intending to intimidate, and in face of Cao Cao's overwhelming force (estimated to be about 220,000 men, although Cao Cao claimed 800,000, against Sun Quan owned 30,000 and the Lius' combined force of 10,000), many of Sun Quan subordinates, even including the highly capable Zhang Zhao, advocated surrender. Sun Quan refused, under advice from Zhou Yu and Lu Su (that Cao Cao would surely not tolerate him even if he surrendered).   Sun put Zhou in charge of his 30,000 men, largely stationed on naval ships, and Zhou set up in a defense position in conjunction with Liu Bei, whose army was stationed on land. About this time, there was a plague developing in Cao's forces which significantly weakened it. Zhou set up a trap where he pretended to be punishing his subordinate  Huang Gai , and Huang Gai pretended to be in such fear that he was willing to surrender to Cao. Zhou then sent ships under Huang's command to pretend to surrender and, as Huang's ships approached Cao's fleet, they were lit on fire to assault Cao's fleet, and Cao's fleet was largely destroyed by fire. Cao led his forces to escape on land, but much of the force was destroyed by Sun Quan and Liu Bei's land forces. The death rate was said to be over 50%.     [ edit ]   Uneasy alliance with Liu Bei   Immediately, after Cao Cao withdrew, Sun Quan took over the northern half of Jing Province. Liu Bei marched south and took over the southern half. The Sun-Liu alliance was further cemented by a marriage of Sun Quan's sister to Liu Bei. Zhou was suspicious of Liu Bei intentions, however, and suggested to Sun Quan that Liu Bei be seized and put under house arrest (albeit be very well-treated) and his forces be merged into Sun Quan's; Sun Quan, believing that Liu Bei's forces would rebel if he did that, declined. Sun Quan did agree to Zhou Yu's plans to consider attacking Liu Zhang and  Zhang Lu  (who controlled the modern southern  Shaanxi ) to try to take over their territories, but after Zhou Yu died in 210, the plans were abandoned. However, Sun Quan was able to persuade the warlords in modern  Guangdong ,  Guangxi , and northern  Vietnam  to submit to him, and they became part of his domain. He then yielded northern Jing to Liu Bei as well, agreeing with Liu Bei that southern Jing was insufficient to supply his troops.   In 215, the Sun-Liu alliance appeared on the verge of break-up, because Sun Quan demanded that Liu Bei return Jing Province and Liu refused. Sun Quan made an initial attack against Liu Bei's general  Guan Yu , who was left in charge of Jing Province by Liu Bei, and most of the eastern Jing Province (east of the  Xiang River ) quickly surrendered. However, after a face-to-face summit between Guan Yu and Lu, the sides renewed their alliance, dividing Jing Province at the Xiang.     [ edit ]   Breaking of alliance with Liu Bei   In 219,  Guan Yu  advanced north, attacking  Fancheng , scoring a major victory over Cao's nephew  Cao Ren . While Fancheng did not fall at this time, Guan put it under siege, and the situation was severe enough that Cao Cao considered moving the capital away from Xu. However, Sun, resentful of Guan's prior constant instigation of hostilities (including seizing Sun's food supplies to use for his campaign north), took the opportunity to attack Guan from the rear, and Guan's forces collapsed. Guan was captured by Sun's general  L Meng ; once captured, Sun Quan executed Guan Yu, Jing Province became Sun's once more, and the Sun-Liu alliance was over. Sun instead nominally submitted to Cao and, indeed, urged him to take the throne. Cao declined, but prepared for his son  Cao Pi  to do so.   After Cao Cao's death in 220, Cao Pi did indeed force Emperor Xian to yield the throne to him, ending the Han Dynasty and establishing  Cao Wei . Sun did not immediately declare himself a Cao Wei subject or declare independence after Cao Pi's enthronement, but took a wait-and-see attitude; by contrast, in early 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor, establishing  Shu Han . Immediately, Liu planned a campaign against Sun to avenge Guan. After attempting to negotiate peace and receiving no positive response from Liu, fearing attack on both sides, Sun declared himself a Cao Wei subject. Cao Pi's strategist  Liu Ye  suggested that Cao decline -- and in fact attack Sun on a second front, effectively partitioning Sun's domain with Shu Han, and then eventually seek to destroy Shu Han as well. Cao declined, in a fateful choice that most historians believe doomed his empire to ruling only the northern and central China -- and this chance would not come again. Indeed, against Liu Ye's advice, he created Sun the Prince of Wu and granted him the  nine bestowments .   In 222, at the  Battle of Xiaoting , Sun's general  Lu Xun  dealt Liu a major defeat, stopping the Shu Han offensive. Shu Han would not again pose a threat to Sun from that point on. Later that year, when Cao Pi demanded that Sun send his  crown prince   Sun Deng  to the Cao Wei capital  Luoyang  as a hostage (to guarantee his loyalty), Sun refused and declared independence (by changing  era name ), thus establishing Eastern Wu as an independent state. Cao Pi therefore launched a major attack on Eastern Wu, but after Cao Wei defeats in early 223, it became clear that Eastern Wu was secure. After Liu Bei's death later that year, Zhuge Jin's brother  Zhuge Liang , the regent for Liu Bei's son and successor  Liu Shan , reestablished the alliance with Sun Quan, and the two states would remain allies until Shu Han's eventual destruction in 263.     [ edit ]   Reign as the monarch of Eastern Wu     [ edit ]   Early reign   Early in Sun Quan's reign, the Eastern Wu administration was known for its efficiency, as Sun showed a knack for listening to correct advice and for delegating authorities to the proper individuals. For example, he correctly trusted the faithful Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin, so much so that he made a duplicate imperial seal and left it with Lu; whenever he would correspond with Shu Han's emperor Liu Shan or regent Zhuge Liang, he would deliver the letter to Lu first (as Lu's post was near the Shu Han border), and then if, in Lu's opinion, changes were needed, he would revise the letter and then restamp it with Sun's imperial seal. Further, Lu and Zhuge Jin were authorized to coordinate their actions with Shu Han without prior imperial approval. Sun treated his high level officials as friends and addressed them accordingly (with courtesy names), and in accordance they dedicated all effort to Eastern Wu's preservation. He also knew what were the proper roles for officials that he trusted; for example, in 225, when selecting a prime minister, while the key officials all respected Zhang Zhao greatly and wanted him to be prime minister, Sun declined -- reasoning that while he respected Zhang greatly, a prime minister needed to handle all affairs of state, and Zhang, while capable, had such strong opinions that he would surely be in conflict with Sun and other officials at all times. He also repeatedly promoted his official  L Fan  even though, while he was young, L had informed to Sun Ce about his improper spending habits, understanding that L did so only out of loyalty to Sun Ce.   In 224 and 225, Cao Pi again made attacks on Eastern Wu, but each time the Eastern Wu forces were able to repel Cao Wei's with fair ease -- so easily that Cao made the comment, ""Heaven created the Yangtze to divide the north and south."" However, Sun was himself equally unsuccessful in efforts to make major attacks on Cao Wei. After Cao Pi's death in 226, for example, Sun launched an attack on Cao Wei's Jiangxia Commandery (roughly modern  Xiaogan ,  Hubei ) but was forced to withdraw as soon as Cao Wei relief forces arrived despite Cao Pi's recent death. However, later that year, he was able to increase his effective control over Jiao Province (, modern northern  Vietnam ) when his general  L Dai  was able to defeat the warlord Shi Hui () and end the effective independence that the Shi clan had. In addition, the several independent kingdoms in modern  Cambodia ,  Laos , and southern  Vietnam  all became Eastern Wu vassals as well.   The one major victory that Eastern Wu would have over Cao Wei during this period came in 228, when, with Sun's approval, his general  Zhou Fang  pretended to be surrendering to Cao Wei after pretending to have been punished repeatedly by Sun. This tricked the Cao Wei general  Cao Xiu , who led a large army south to support Zhou. He walked into the trap set by Zhou and Lu Xun and suffered major losses, but was saved from total annihilation by  Jia Kui .   In 229, Sun declared himself emperor, which almost damaged the alliance with Shu Han, as many Shu Han officials saw this as a sign of betrayal of the Han Dynasty -- which Shu Han claimed to be the legitimate successor to. However, Zhuge Liang opposed ending the alliance and in fact confirmed it with a formal treaty later that year, in which the two states pledged to support each other and divide Cao Wei equally if they could conquer it. Later that year, he moved his capital from Wuchang (, in modern  Ezhou ,  Hubei ) to  Jianye , leaving his crown prince Sun Deng, assisted by Lu Xun, in charge of the western empire.     [ edit ]   Middle reign   In 230, however, the first sign of the deterioration of Sun Quan's reign occurred. That year, he sent his generals Wei Wen () and Zhuge Zhi () with a navy of 10,000 into the  East China Sea  to seek the legendary islands of Yizhou (, may be modern  Taiwan ) and Danzhou (, may be modern  Japan ) to seek to conquer them, despite strenuous opposition of Lu Xun and  Quan Cong . The navy was not able to locate Danzhou but located Yizhou, and returned in 231 after capturing several thousand men -- but only after 80-90% of the navy had died of illnesses. Instead of seeing his own fault in this venture, Sun simply executed Wei Wen and Zhuge Zhi. Perhaps concerned about this deterioration in Sun Quan's judgment, Sun Deng left the western empire in Lu's hands in 232 and returned in Jianye, and would remain at Jianye until his own death in 241.   In 232, Sun had another misadventure involving his navy -- as he sent his generals Zhou He () and Pei Qian () to the nominal Cao Wei vassal  Gongsun Yuan , in control of Liaodong Commandery (modern central  Liaoning ), to purchase horses, against the advice of  Yu Fan  -- and indeed, he exiled Yu to the desolate Cangwu Commandery (roughly modern  Wuzhou ,  Guangxi ) as punishment. Just as Yu predicted, however, the venture would end in failure -- as Zhou and Pei, on their way back, were intercepted by Cao Wei forces and killed. Regretting his actions, Sun tried to recall Yu back to Jianye, only to learn that Yu had died in exile.   The next year, however, Sun would have yet another misadventure in his dealings with Gongsun, as Gongsun sent messengers to him, offering to be his subject. Sun was ecstatic, and created Gongsun the Prince of Yan and granted him the  nine bestowments , and further sent a detachment of 10,000 men by sea north to assist Gongsun in his campaign against Cao Wei, against the advice of nearly every single one of his high level officials, particularly Zhang Zhao. Once the army arrived, however, Gongsun betrayed them, killing Sun's officials Zhang Mi () and Xu Yan (), whom Sun had sent to grant the bestowments and seized their troops. Once that happened, the enraged Sun wanted to personally head north with a fleet to attack Gongsun, and initially, not even Lu's opposition was able to stop him, although he eventually calmed down and did not follow through. To his credit, he also personally went to Zhang's house and apologized to Zhang. Further, despite the deterioration in his previous clear thinking, he was still capable of making proper decisions at times. For example, in 235, when, as a sign of contempt, Cao Wei's emperor  Cao Rui  offered horses to him in exchange for pearls, jade, and tortoise shells, Sun ignored the implicit insult and made the exchange, reasoning that his empire needed horses much more than pearls, jade, or tortoise shells.   In 234, in coordination with Zhuge Liang's final  northern expedition  against Cao Wei, Sun personally led a major attack against Cao Wei's border city  Hefei , while having Lu and Zhuge Jin attack  Xiangyang , with the strategy of trying to attract Cao Wei relief forces and then attacking them. However, Cao Wei's generals correctly saw the situation and simply let Sun siege Hefei. Only after Sun's food supplies ran low did  Cao Rui  personally arrive with relief forces, and Sun withdrew, as did Lu and Zhuge. (This would prove to be the first of only two coordinated efforts made by allies Eastern Wu and Shu Han against Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period.)   In 238, when Gongsun was under attack by Cao Wei's general  Sima Yi , Sun, despite his prior rage against Gongsun, correctly judged the situation as one where he might be able to take advantage if Sima were initially unsuccessful, did not immediately refuse Gongsun's request for help. However, as Sima was able to conquer Gongsun quickly, Sun never launched the major attack that he considered if Sima got stuck in a stalemate with Gongsun. That year, he also recognized how his head secretary L Yi () had been falsely accusing his officials, and had L executed; he then further confirmed his trust in the high level officials by personally writing an emotional letter to Zhuge Jin,  Bu Zhi ,  Zhu Ran , and  L Dai , blaming himself for the recent problems with his administration while urging them to speak out honestly whenever they saw faults in him.   In 241, Sun would launch the last major assault against Cao Wei of his reign, in light of Cao Rui's death in 239, but he rejected a strategy offered by Yin Zha () to attack Cao Wei in coordinated effort with Shu Han on four different fronts, and the campaign ended in failure as well.     [ edit ]   Late reign   Later in 241, Crown Prince Deng died -- an event that left open the issue of succession and appeared to mark the start of a precipitous decline in Sun Quan's mental health. In 242, he created his son  Sun He , by Consort Wang, crown prince. However, he also favored another son by Consort Wang, Sun Ba () the Prince of Lu, and permitted Sun Ba to have the same staffing level as the crown prince -- a move that was objected to by a number of officials as encouraging Prince Ba to compete with Prince He, but Sun Quan did not listen to them. After 245, when Crown Prince He and Prince Ba began to have separate residences, their relationship detriorated further, and Prince Ba began to scheme at how to seize heir status from Prince He. Fanned by gossip from his daughter Sun Dahu (), Sun Quan blamed the princes' mother Consort Wang for this -- and she died in fear. He also cut off Crown Prince He and Prince Ba's access to the officials who supported them in hopes of receiving future favors, but this could not stop Prince Ba's machinations. Indeed, when Lu Xun tried to intervene to protect Crown Prince He, Prince Ba falsely accused him of many crimes, and Sun Quan became provoked so much that he repeatedly rebuked Lu -- causing Lu to die in anger.   In 250, fed up with Prince Ba's constant attacks against Crown Prince He, Sun Quan carried out an inexplicable combination of actions -- he forced Prince Ba to commit suicide, while deposing Crown Prince He (who had not been shown to have committed any crimes), and instead creating his youngest son,  Sun Liang , crown prince to replace Prince He. This move was opposed by his son-in-law  Zhu Ju  (the husband of Princess Xiaohu), but Zhu's pleas not only did not help Prince He, but also resulted in his own death, as Sun forced him to commit suicide. Many other officials who also opposed the move, as well as officials who had supported Prince Ba, were executed.   Around this time, Sun also had his generals destroy a number of levees near the border with Cao Wei, creating large areas of flooding, in order to obstruct potential attacks from Cao Wei.   In 251, Sun created the first empress of his reign -- Crown Prince Liang's mother  Consort Pan . (Previously, he had a succession of wives, but never created any of them empresses, except that his favorite, Lady Bu, was created empress posthumously after her death in 238.) Later that year, however, he realized that Prince He was blameless and wanted to recall him from his exile, but was persuaded not to do so by his daughter Princess Dahu and  Sun Jun , who had supported Crown Prince Liang's ascension. He realized that he was getting very old (69 by this point) and, at Sun Jun's recommendation, commissioned Zhuge Jin's son  Zhuge Ke  as the future regent for Crown Prince Liang -- even though he correctly had misgivings about how Zhuge Ke was arrogant and had overly high opinion of his own abilities -- because at that time, virtually the entire empire, awed by Zhuge's prior military victories, was convinced that Zhuge would be the correct choice for regent.   In 252, as Sun Quan neared death, Empress Pan was murdered -- but how she was murdered remains a controversy. Eastern Wu officials claimed that her servants, unable to stand her temper, strangled her while she was asleep, while a number of historians, including  Hu Sansheng , the commentator to  Sima Guang 's  Zizhi Tongjian , believed that top Eastern Wu officials were complicit, as they feared that she would seize power as  empress dowager  after Sun's death. Later that year, Sun died at the age of 70, and Crown Prince Liang succeeded him. Sun Quan was buried in a mausoleum at  Purple Mountain  in present-day  Nanjing .     [ edit ]   Modern references          Sun Quan as he appears in  Koei 's  Dynasty Warriors 6 .       Sun Quan is a playable character in the  Koei  video game series,  Dynasty Warriors . He is portrayed as a stolid man with an intensely serious personality, which is in stark contrast to his brother,  Sun Ce , who is informal and care-free.   Sun Quan was portrayed by  Chang Chen  in the 2008 movie  Red Cliff , directed by  John Woo .

clueweb09-enwp01-82-06812	"                     Sun Lin          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search              Sun Lin          Traditional Chinese :          Simplified Chinese :                Transliterations             Sun Lin  (231-258),  courtesy name   Zitong  (), was a  regent  during the reigns of emperors  Sun Liang  and  Sun Xiu  of  Eastern Wu , whose conflicts with Sun Liang eventually led him to depose the emperor in favor of Sun Liang's brother Sun Xiu, but who was subsequently killed by Sun Xiu in a coup.   Sun Lin and his predecessor  Sun Jun  were cousins; both were great-grandsons of the founding emperor  Sun Quan 's uncle  Sun Jing . Very little is known about his career up to Sun Jun's sudden illness in 256, when Sun Jun chose to transfer his powers to Sun Lin. Sun Jun died soon thereafter, and Sun Lin became regent. The general L Ju () was angry at the development (as Sun Jun was already resented for his dictatorial style and lack of accomplishments), and, in conjunction with the prime minister Teng Yin (), he attempted to overthrow Sun Lin. Sun Lin struck back militarily, and his forces defeated Teng's and L's. Teng and his clan were executed, while L committed suicide. In light of his defeat of Teng and L, Sun Lin began to become extremely arrogant.   In 257, at the age of 14, Sun Liang began to personally handle some important matters of state. He established a personal guard corps, consistent of young men and officers with age similar to his, stating that he intended to grow up with them. He also sometimes questioned Sun Lin's decisions. Sun Lin began to be somewhat apprehensive of the young emperor.   Later that year,  Cao Wei 's general  Zhuge Dan , believing that the Cao Wei regent  Sima Zhao  was about to usurp the throne, declared a rebellion and requested Eastern Wu assistance. A small Eastern Wu detachment, led by  Wen Qin  (), himself a former Cao Wei general who had defected to Eastern Wu, quickly arrived to assist him, but Sun Lin led the main forces and chose to camp a long distance away from Shouchun, where Zhuge was being sieged by Sima, and did nothing. When Sun Lin instead ordered the general  Zhu Yi  to try to relieve Shouchun with tired and unfed troops, Zhu refused -- and Sun Lin executed him, bringing anger from the people, who had admired Zhu's military skills and integrity. With Sun Lin unable to do anything, Zhuge's rebellion failed in 258, and Wen's troops became captives of Cao Wei.   Sun Lin knew that the people and the young emperor were both angry at him, and chose not to return to Jianye, but instead sent his confidants to be in charge of the capital's defenses. Sun Liang became angrier, and plotted with Princess Dahu, the general Liu Cheng (), his father-in-law Quan Shang (), and his brother-in-law Quan Ji (), to have Sun Lin overthrown. However, Quan Shang did not keep the plot secret from his wife, who was Sun Lin's cousin, and she told Sun Lin. Sun Lin quickly captured Quan Shang and killed Liu, and then surrounded the palace and forced the other officials to agree to depose Sun Liang -- falsely declaring to the people that Sun Liang had suffered psychosis. Sun Liang was demoted to the title of the Prince of Kuaiji.   Sun Lin then chose Sun Liang's older brother Sun Xiu, the Prince of Langye, as the new emperor. Sun Xiu, in order to appease Sun Lin, added five counties to his  march  and created his brothers marquesses as well. However, Sun Lin soon had a fallout with the new emperor over a relatively small incident -- Sun Lin had brought beef and wine to the palace, intending to feast with the emperor, but Sun Xiu refused the offering, and so Sun Lin took the food and wine to the house of the general Zhang Bu (). He expressed to Zhang his disappointment at Sun Xiu's refusal -- including a remark that perhaps he should choose another emperor -- and Zhang reported Sun Lin's complaints to Sun Xiu. Sun Xiu became concerned about Sun Lin, but continued to outwardly show favor to Sun Lin. Sun Lin became concerned about his standing with the emperor and offered to leave the capital Jianye (, modern  Nanjing ) to head up the defense of the secondary capital Wuchang (, in modern  Ezhou ,  Hubei ). Sun Xiu approved.   However, Sun Xiu then became concerned that Sun Lin would take over that city and rebel. He conspired with Zhang and the senior general  Ding Feng  to kill Sun Lin at the Laba (, eighth day of the 12th lunar month of the year) festival. Somehow, the news leaked, but Sun Lin, even though apprehensive, showed up at the festival anyway and was seized by Ding and Zhang's soldiers. Sun Lin begged Sun Xiu for his life, offering to be exiled to Jiao Province (modern northern  Vietnam ) or to become a slave, but Sun Xiu declined -- stating to Sun Lin that he did not give Teng or L those choices. Sun was executed, as were members of his clan.     [ edit ]   References     Records of Three Kingdoms ,  vol. 64 .

Sun Liang  (243260) was an  emperor  of  Eastern Wu  during the  Three Kingdoms period . He was the founding emperor  Sun Quan 's youngest son and heir. He is also known as the  Prince of Kuaiji  () or (less frequently)  Marquess of Houguan  (), which were his successive titles after his removal in 258 by the regent  Sun Lin  following his failed attempt to remove Sun Lin from power. He was succeeded by his brother  Sun Xiu , who was successful in having Sun Lin killed. Two years after Sun Liang's removal, he was falsely accused of treason and demoted to marquess, and he committed suicide.

As Sun Quan's youngest son, he was well-cared for by his father, who was very happy to have a son in his old age (61 at the time of Sun Liang's birth). He was also born into a palace atmosphere where officials were aligning themselves with either of his two older brothers who were fighting for supremacy --  Sun He  the  crown prince  and Sun Ba () the Prince of Lu, who had designs on the position. In 250, fed up with Prince Ba's constant attacks against Crown Prince He, Sun Quan inexplicably ordered Prince Ba to commit suicide and deposed Crown Prince He. At the urging of his daughter Sun Dahu (), who had been involved with falsely accusing Crown Prince He and his mother Consort Wang of crimes and therefore wanted to see Crown Prince He removed, he created Prince Liang as the new crown prince. Princess Dahu then had Crown Prince Liang married to a grand niece of her husband Quan Cong (). In 251, Sun Quan created Crown Prince Liang's mother Consort Pan  empress .   In 252, Crown Prince Liang would lose both of his parents in rapid succession. Early that year, Empress Pan was murdered -- but how she was murdered remains a controversy. Eastern Wu officials claimed that her servants, unable to stand her temper, strangled her while she was asleep, while a number of historians, including  Hu Sansheng , the commentator to  Sima Guang 's  Zizhi Tongjian , believed that top Eastern Wu officials were complicit, as they feared that she would seize power as  empress dowager  after Sun Quan's death. Later that year, Sun Quan died, and Crown Prince Liang succeeded to the throne.     [ edit ]   Reign     [ edit ]   Zhuge Ke's regency   Prior to his death, Sun Quan had selected  Zhuge Jin 's son  Zhuge Ke  as the  regent  for Sun Liang, at the endorsement of his trusted assistant  Sun Jun  (a great-grandson of his uncle Sun Jing ()). The people of the empire also greatly admired Zhuge Ke, as he was already known for his military and diplomatic successes involving the indigenous  Yue  and for his quick wit. However, Sun's only reservation -- that Zhuge was arrogant and had overly high opinion of his own abilities -- would turn out to be prophetic.   In 252, in light of Sun Quan's death,  Cao Wei 's regent  Sima Shi  made a major three-pronged attack against Eastern Wu. Zhuge's forces, however, were able to defeat the main Cao Wei force, inflicting heavy losses. Zhuge's reputation became even more established. In 253, he carried out a plan he had for a while -- to gather up nearly all service-eligible young men of Eastern Wu to make a major attack against Cao Wei -- despite opposition by a number of other officials. He further coordinated his attack with ally  Shu Han 's regent  Jiang Wei . However, his strategy turned out to be faulty -- as he was initially targeting Shouchun (, in modern  Lu'an ,  Anhui ) but, on his way, changed his mind and attack  Hefei  instead, despite the fact that Hefei's defenses were strong and intended to withstand major Eastern Wu attacks. Zhuge's forces became worn out by the long-term siege and suffered plagues -- which Zhuge ignored. He eventually withdrew after Cao Wei reinforcements arrived, but instead of returning to the capital  Jianye  (modern  Nanjing ) and apologize for his erroneous strategies, he remained from the capital for some time and never apologized to the people for the heavy losses suffered.   When Zhuge eventually did return to Jianye, he further sternly tried to wipe out all dissent, punishing all those who disagreed with him. He further planned another attack against Cao Wei, disregarding the recent heavy losses the people had suffered and their resentment. Sun Jun decided that he had to kill Zhuge. He told Sun Liang that Zhuge was planning treason, and he set up a trap at the imperial feast for Zhuge. (How much the young emperor knew of Sun Jun's plans and whether he concurred is unclear; traditional historians implied that Sun Liang knew and concurred, but he was just 10 years old at this point.) During the middle of the feast, assassins that Sun Jun had arranged for killed Zhuge, and Sun Jun's forces then wiped out the Zhuge clan.     [ edit ]   Sun Jun's regency   After Sun Jun killed Zhuge Ke, he quickly moved to consolidate his power. He initially, on the surface, shared power with the prime minister Teng Yin (), but he, with control of the military, soon became even more dictatorial than Zhuge. In particular, he falsely accused the former crown prince Sun He of conspiring with Zhuge, and forced Sun He to commit suicide. His autocratic actions led to a conspiracy between Sun Ying () the Marquess of Wu (the son of Sun Quan's first crown prince Sun Deng ()) and the army officer Huan L (), but he discovered the plan in 254, and both Sun Ying and Huan were executed.   In 255, in the midst of Cao Wei's having to deal with a rebellion by  Guanqiu Jian  and Wen Qin (), Eastern Wu forces, led by Sun Jun, tried to attack Cao Wei's border region, but withdrew after Sima Shi quickly put down the rebellion. (Wen and his troops did surrender to him after they were defeated.) Later that year, another plot against Sun Jun was discovered, and a large number of officers were executed, along with Sun Quan's daughter Sun Xiaohu (), falsely implicated by her sister Princess Dahu.   In 256, Sun Jun, at Wen's urging, was planning an attack against Cao Wei, when he suddenly fell ill, and he commissioned his cousin  Sun Lin  to succeed him as regent and died soon after.     [ edit ]   Sun Lin's regency   Sun Jun's death would precipitate a major confrontation. The general L Ju (), who was set to lead the main force against Cao Wei, was angry that the autocratic Sun Jun appointed Sun Lin, who up to that point had not shown himself distinguished in any way. L openly called for Teng to become regent instead, and Teng agreed to act with him. Sun Lin struck back militarily, and his forces defeated Teng's and L's. Teng and his clan were executed, while L committed suicide. In light of his defeat of Teng and L, Sun Lin began to become extremely arrogant.   In 257, at the age of 14, Sun Liang began to personally handle some important matters of state. He established a personal guard corps, consistent of young men and officers with age similar to his, stating that he intended to grow up with them. He also sometimes questioned Sun Lin's decisions. Sun Lin began to be somewhat apprehensive of the young emperor.   Later that year, Cao Wei's general  Zhuge Dan , believing that the Cao Wei regent  Sima Zhao  (Sima Shi's brother) was about to usurp the throne, declared a rebellion and requested Eastern Wu assistance. A small Eastern Wu detachment, led by Wen, quickly arrived to assist him, but Sun Lin led the main forces and chose to camp a long distance away from Shouchun, where Zhuge was being sieged by Sima, and did nothing. When Sun Lin instead ordered the general Zhu Yi to try to relieve Shouchun with tired and unfed troops, Zhu refused -- and Sun Lin executed him, bringing anger from the people, who had admired Zhu's military skills and integrity. With Sun Lin unable to do anything, Zhuge's rebellion failed in 258, and Wen's troops became captives of Cao Wei.     [ edit ]   Removal   Sun Lin knew that the people and the young emperor were both angry at him, and chose not to return to Jianye, but instead sent his confidants to be in charge of the capital's defenses. Sun Liang became angrier, and plotted with Princess Dahu, the general Liu Cheng (), his father-in-law Quan Shang (), and his brother-in-law Quan Ji (), to have Sun Lin overthrown. However, Quan Shang did not keep the plot secret from his wife, who was Sun Lin's cousin, and she told Sun Lin. Sun Lin quickly captured Quan Shang and killed Liu, and then surrounded the palace and forced the other officials to agree to depose Sun Liang -- falsely declaring to the people that Sun Liang had suffered psychosis. Sun Liang was demoted to the title of the Prince of Kuaiji.     [ edit ]   After removal   Sun Lin then made Sun Liang's older brother  Sun Xiu , the Prince of Langye, emperor. Several months later, Sun Xiu set a trap for Sun Lin and had him arrested and killed. However, Sun Liang's position in exile did not become any safer, as Sun Xiu deeply feared that there would be plots to return Sun Liang to the throne. In 260, there were rumors that Sun Liang would be emperor again, and Sun Liang's servant girls falsely accused him of employing witchcraft. Sun Xiu demoted Sun Liang to the title of the Marquess of Houguan, and sent him to his  march  (in modern  Fuzhou ,  Fujian , then considered in deep wilderness). On the way, Sun Liang died -- and while most historians believe that he committed suicide, an alternative theory is that Sun Xiu had him poisoned.

The  National Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall  is located in  Taipei City ,  Taiwan ,  Republic of China . It is a memorial to the  Republic of China 's  National Father , Dr. Sun Yat-sen , and was completed on  May 16 ,  1972 . As the hall was opened in the very beginning, its main displays were revolutionary events of the national father at the end of the  Qing Dynasty . Recently it became a multi-purpose  social ,  educational  and  cultural  center for the Taiwanese public.

The Republic of China government began to prepare the construction of the National Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in 1964 to commemorate Father of the Republic of China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great character, revolutionary career, and philosophical blueprint for a modern China. The hall would serve as a place not only for people to pay tribute to Father of the Republic, but also for cultural, artistic, educational, academic, and recreational purposes. In 1965,  Chiang Kai-shek  officiated the ground breaking ceremony. The design plan by the famous architect Wang Ta-hung was selected in a public contest one year later, and modified under the instruction of Chiang, to underline Chinese architectural characteristics. The main construction was completed on  May 16 ,  1972 . The majestic and solemn building itself is sited in Chung-shan Square Park, featuring green grass and floral bushes. It now boasts to have the landmark building, a scenic open space, and the best performance center in eastern  Taipei City .   The Memorial Hall was affiliated to Taipei City Government originally. In June 1986, it became part of the Ministry of Education, together with Chung-shan Hall in Yang Ming Mountain. Its official name was changed from ""the Administrative Bureau of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall"" to ""the National Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall"".   In the early time, the Memorial Hall primarily functioned as a place to display the historical relics of Dr. Sun's life and lead in the revolution. Later, it opens to exhibitions and performances. Now, it has a world-class performance hall, and elegant exhition center with an area of around 10,000 square feet (1,000 m 2 ). It also has a multi-media theatre with the newest facilities, an audio-visual center, lecture halls, Chung-shan Symposium, a professional library with a collection of over three hundred thousand books, Lake Tswei exhibition and performance area, and Chung-shan park.   The Memorial Hall is committed to the promotion of Dr. Sun's philosophies - universal love, an egalitarian society, and the ""goal of life to help the others"" and to refresh the people's memory of Dr. Sun and pass on his beliefs. The first director Shih Chun-wen set up a solid foundation for the Memorial Hall. succeeding directors, Frank C.C. Tong, Wang Ching-po, Kao Chung-yun and Tseng Chiang-yuan let the Memorial Hall come of age. The present director, Chang Jui-pin, has taken it into the stage of prosperity. Now, the Memorial Hall advances towards internationalization, localization, life-time education, and renovation of hardware facilities. The aim is to integrate Dr. Sun's beliefs with more attributes of contemporary Chinese culture.   Shortly after the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall was built, President  Chiang Kai-shek  died of pneumonia in Taipei. His funeral was held in the main hall of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. Tens of thousands of people turned out to view President Chiang's body. His body was moved to Chihu, Taoyuan County in a slow motor procession. Thousands of people lined up on the streets to view Chiang's open casket.     [ edit ]   Exterior          A wall in the exterior courts of the memorial.       The exterior of the hall contains some gardens, and decorative historical walls. It has many wide open spaces where the people of Taipei often go to spend some time relaxing.

The interior of the hall includes a main hall entrance with a statue of Sun Yat-sen and many exits to other parts of the hall, containing historical artifacts.   Every hour, there is a formal changing of the guards that is a common tourist attraction.       [ edit ]   Transportation   More than thirty bus routes have stops at or near Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall; the  MRT  Kunyang-Tucheng-Banqiao Line also stops at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall Station. Charter buses are also available during special events. There is also a parking lot at the entrance, and more parking lots can be found in the nearby Shin-Yi district.

Sun Xiu  (235 September 3 ,  264 [ 1 ] ),  courtesy name   Zilie  (), formally  Emperor Jing of (Eastern) Wu , was the third emperor of  Eastern Wu  during the  Three Kingdoms  period in ancient  China .           Contents       1   Early life   2   Sun Xiu's killing of Sun Lin   3   Reign   4   Notes and references   5   Era name   6   Personal information   7   See also               [ edit ]   Early life   Sun Xiu was born in 235 to the founding emperor of Eastern Wu,  Sun Quan , and his concubine Consort Wang. In his young age, he was known for his studiousness. About 250, Sun Quan had him marry the daughter of his sister  Sun Xiaohu  () and her husband  Zhu Ju .   In 252, just before Sun Quan's death, he was created the Prince of Langye, with his fief at Hulin (, in modern  Chizhou ,  Anhui ). Later that year, after his younger brother  Sun Liang  became emperor under the regency of  Zhuge Ke , Zhuge did not want the princes to be based near the important military bases along the  Yangtze River , so he moved Sun Xiu to Danyang (, in modern  Xuancheng ,  Anhui , not the modern locale in  Zhenjiang ,  Jiangsu ). Unlike his brother  Sun Fen  () the Prince of Qi, who initially resisted, Sun Xiu did not put up any resistance to the move. Once he was at Danyang, however, the governor of Danyang Commandery, Li Heng (), found many excuses to bully the young prince. Sun Xiu could not endure it, and so he petitioned his brother for another move; his brother had him moved to Kuaiji (, in modern  Shaoxing ,  Zhejiang ).   In 255, at the instigation of Sun Xiu's sister  Sun Dahu  (), the regent  Sun Jun , who had killed and replaced Zhuge in 253, killed Princess Xiaohu. Sun Xiu became fearful, and sent his wife Princess Zhu back to the capital  Jianye , effectively offering to divorce her, but Sun Jun declined by sending Princess Zhu back to Sun Xiu.   In 258, after Sun Liang had tried to but failed to remove  Sun Lin , Sun Jun's cousin and successor, Sun Lin had Sun Liang removed from the throne. He welcomed Sun Xiu to the capital and had him declared emperor.     [ edit ]   Sun Xiu's killing of Sun Lin   Sun Xiu, in order to appease Sun Lin, added five counties to his  march  and created his brothers marquesses as well. However, Sun Lin soon had a fallout with the new emperor over a relatively small incident -- Sun Lin had brought beef and wine to the palace, intending to feast with the emperor, but Sun Xiu refused the offering, and so Sun Lin took the food and wine to the house of the general  Zhang Bu  (). He expressed to Zhang his disappointment at Sun Xiu's refusal -- including a remark that perhaps he should choose another emperor -- and Zhang reported Sun Lin's complaints to Sun Xiu. Sun Xiu became concerned about Sun Lin, but continued to outwardly show favor to Sun Lin. Sun Lin became concerned about his standing with the emperor and offered to leave Jianye to head up the defense of the secondary capital Wuchang (, in modern  Ezhou ,  Hubei ). Sun Xiu approved.   However, Sun Xiu then became concerned that Sun Lin would take over that city and rebel. He conspired with Zhang and the senior general  Ding Feng  to kill Sun Lin at the Laba (, eighth day of the 12th lunar month of the year) festival. Somehow, the news leaked, but Sun Lin, even though apprehensive, showed up at the festival anyway and was seized by Ding and Zhang's soldiers. Sun Lin begged Sun Xiu for his life, offering to be exiled to Jiao Province (modern northern  Vietnam ) or to become a slave, but Sun Xiu declined -- stating to Sun Lin that he did not give Teng Yin (), whom he killed in 256, or L Ju (), who committed suicide after Teng's death, those choices. Sun was executed, as were members of his clan.     [ edit ]   Reign   As emperor, Sun Xiu was known for being tolerant of differing opinions, as well as his studiousness. However, he did not appear to be a particularly capable emperor, either in military or domestic matters, and he entrusted most of the important affairs to Zhang and Puyang Xing (), neither of whom was particularly capable either. Both were also moderately corrupt. The government was therefore not efficient or effective. For example, in 260, at Puyang's suggestion, a costly project was started to create an artificial lake known as the Puli Lake (, in modern  Xuancheng ,  Anhui ) to create a defense against the rival  Cao Wei , even though most other officials believed the project to be too costly and futile. Eventually, the project had to be abandoned when it became clear that it could not be completed.   Also in 260, Sun Xiu, who had always been concerned about plots regarding his deposed brother, the former emperor Sun Liang, acted after receiving false reports that Sun Liang had used witchcraft. He had Sun Liang demoted from being the Prince of Kuaiji to the Marquess of Houguan and sent him to his  march  (in modern  Fuzhou ,  Fujian ). Sun Liang died on the way -- with the prevalent theory being that he committed suicide, but with some historians believing that Sun Xiu poisoned him.   According to the Eastern Wu ambassador Xue Xu (), who visited Eastern Wu's ally  Shu Han  in 261 at the order of Sun Xiu, the status that Shu Han was in at this point was:     The emperor is incompetent and does not know his errors; his subordinates just try to get by without causing trouble for themselves. When I was visiting them, I heard no honest words, and when I visited their countryside, the people looked hungry. I have heard of a story of swallows and sparrows making nests on top of mansions and being content, believing that it was the safest place, not realizing that the haystack and the support beams were on fire and that disaster was about to come. This might be what they are like.     However, historians largely believe that Xue was not just referring to Shu Han, but rather using Shu Han's situation to try to awaken Sun Xiu so that he would realize that Eastern Wu was in a similar situation. Sun Xiu did not appear to realize this, however.   In 262, Sun Xiu created his wife Princess Zhu empress. He also created his oldest son Sun Wan  crown prince .   In 263, due to the corruption of the commandery governor Sun Xu (), the people of the  Jiaozhi  Commandery (, modern  Hanoi ,  Vietnam ) rebelled, and they were joined by people of Jiuzhen (, modern  Khanh Hoa ,  Vietnam ) and Ri'nan (, modern  Quang Tri ,  Vietnam ) Commanderies, and the rebels sought military assistance from Cao Wei. (The rebellion would in fact eventually receive assistance from Cao Wei and its successor state,  Jin , and would not be quelled until 271, long after Sun Xiu's reign.)   Also in 263, Shu Han was targeted by a major Cao Wei attack and sought assistance from Eastern Wu. Sun Xiu sent two separate forces, one attacking  Shouchun  and one heading toward  Hanzhong  to try to alleviate pressures on Shu Han, but neither was at all successful, and Shu Han's capital  Chengdu  and its emperor  Liu Shan  surrendered later that year without having received major help from Eastern Wu. Sun Xiu then heard that many Shu Han cities were still not decided as to what to do, and he sent a detachment to try to occupy them, but his forces were repelled by the former Shu Han general Luo Xian (), the governor of Badong Commandery (, now mostly under water as part of the  Three Gorges Dam  reservoir), who wanted to carry out Liu Shan's orders to surrender to Cao Wei, and was unable to seize any former Shu Han territory.   In summer 264, Sun Xiu fell ill and was unable to speak but still could write, so he wrote an edict summoning Puyang to the palace, where he pointed and entrusted Crown Prince Wan to him. Sun Xiu died soon thereafter. However, Puyang did not follow his wishes. Rather, after consulting with Zhang, they believed that the people were, in light of Shu Han's recent fall, yearning for an older emperor. (It is not known how old Crown Prince Wan was at this point, but Sun Xiu himself died at age 29, so it was unlikely that Crown Prince Wan was even a teenager.) At the recommendation of the general Wan Yu (), who was friendly with former crown prince  Sun He 's son  Sun Hao  the Marquess of Wucheng, Puyang and Zhang declared Sun Hao emperor instead.

He was married to a woman of the  Liu  clan. He first served  Yuan Shu , but later changed allegiance to  Sun Ce .

It was there that he met Sun Ce, one of Yuan Shu's young generals. They became close friends, and L Fan participated in all of Sun Ce's battles under Yuan Shu from then on.   It is said that L Fan recommended himself through a game of  Go  - Sun Ce made a bad opening move, and L Fan capitalized upon it, pointing out Sun Ce's mistake. Sun Ce was suitably impressed and offered L Fan a post. Rather than accept a high and lofty position, however, L Fan insisted upon remaining in a low and humble one where he could more effectively manage troops. This also impressed Sun Ce, and the two became inseparable. The game of Go in question, called the ""Sun-L Game"", is purported to be the first Go game to be recorded move for move, but many scholars doubt its authenticity. After this, L Fan was appointed as Chief Controller.   At one point during the beginning of Sun Ce's career, L Fan was sent to bring Sun's family from Guangling to  Qu'a . The governor of  Xu province ,  Tao Qian , despised Sun Ce and sought to imprison L Fan as a spy and torture him, but some retainers freed him, and he was able to successfully rescue Sun Ce's family. L Fan became so trusted by Sun Ce that he was treated the same as a member of Sun's own family, given food and drink before Sun's own mother,  Lady Wu .   L Fan was third only to  Cheng Pu  and  Xu Kun  in terms of merits, following Sun Ce in every battle. His unit defeated and killed  Yan Baihu 's subordinate,  Chen Mu . Later, when Yuan Shu declared himself emperor, Sun Ce declared his independence, and L Fan remained with his forces, and even participated in battle against his former master.  Chen Yu , a man appointed by  Cao Cao  to supposedly aid Sun Ce in the war against Yuan Shu, secretly plotted to destroy Sun Ce from within, but Sun foresaw this and sent L Fan to destroy him. L Fan decisively defeated Chen Yu, and as a result, Chen Yu fled to  Yuan Shao  in the north, never to be heard from again.   Upon his victory over the leader of the remnants of Yuan Shu's forces,  Liu Xun , as well as  Huang Zu  and  Liu Biao  at  Shaxian , Sun Ce submitted a memorial to the emperor, naming L Fan as designated Grand Administrator of Guiyang (an area within Liu Biao's jurisdiction) among other things.   In 200, Sun Ce died of injuries sustained during an assassination attempt, and his brother,  Sun Quan  received his command and seal.   L Fan served as Sun Ce's chief strategist historically, while in popular culture, that role is often fulfilled by Sun's close friend,  Zhou Yu . However, Zhou Yu was absent for many of Sun Ce's campaigns, whereas L Fan was at each one.     [ edit ]   Service under Sun Quan   L Fan served as one of Sun Quan's most trusted civil officers. Initially, before Sun Ce's death, Sun Quan and L Fan had had some disagreement - being young and foolhardy, Sun Quan often took money for personal interests and asked L Fan to fix the books. L Fan, however, remained honest, thus causing Sun Quan to dislike him. After his brother's death, however, Sun Quan matured greatly and admired L Fan's earlier honesty, thus valuing him highly.   In 208, Cao Cao led a fleet down to the  Battle of Red Cliffs  in hopes of destroying his weakened rival,  Liu Bei , and sought Sun Quan's assistance in the matter. At the request of Zhou Yu and others, however, Sun Quan instead opposed Cao Cao and allied with Liu Bei. L Fan participated in the battle, serving as a subordinate to Zhou Yu.   After the victory at Red Cliffs,  Lu Su  suggested ceding the southern part of  Jing province  to Liu Bei. Zhou Yu and L Fan protested against such a plan, but after Zhou Yu's death of illness in 210, Sun Quan agreed to Lu Su's plan instead, even allowing additional concessions to Liu Bei. The resulting diplomatic mess would culminate in open hostilities between Liu Bei and Sun Quan a decade later.   In 223,  Cao Wei  generals  Cao Xiu  and  Zang Ba  launched an attack on  Dongkou . L Fan commanded the defense, leading men such as  Sun Shao  and  Xu Sheng  into battle. Things went poorly for Wu from the start: a heavy wind came and destroyed much of L Fan's fleet, and Cao Xiu attacked viciously. To further add to Eastern Wu's troubles, Sun Quan's younger brother,  Sun Lang , accidentally burnt L Fan's supplies of food and weaponry. Miraculously, Sun Shao and Xu Sheng were able to counterattack, and it was through their hard work that the battle was won.   Afterwards, L Fan was appointed as governor of Yang province and even Commander-in-Chief. However, he died shortly after his appointment in 228.

clueweb09-enwp01-23-08014	"                     L Fan          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This  Three Kingdoms -related  article or section may fail to make a  clear distinction between fact and  fiction .   Please  edit this article , according to the  fiction guidelines , to meet Wikipedia's  quality standards .           L Fan          Traditional Chinese :          Simplified Chinese :                Transliterations               This is a  Chinese name ; the  family name  is   L  () .     L Fan , styled  Ziheng  () (died 228) was an officer serving  Eastern Wu  during the  Three Kingdoms  era of  China .   L Fan was a man from  Runan  Commandery in  Yang province . He was married to a woman of the  Liu  clan. He first served  Yuan Shu , but later changed allegiance to  Sun Ce . He was integral to the military progress of Wu and contributed much to the state's welfare until his death in 228.           Contents       1   Service under Yuan Shu and Sun Ce   2   Service under Sun Quan   3   Descendants and Legacy   4   See also   5   References               [ edit ]   Service under Yuan Shu and Sun Ce   L Fan began his career as a minor official in the service of Yuan Shu, one of several warlords during the  Eastern Han Dynasty . It was there that he met Sun Ce, one of Yuan Shu's young generals. They became close friends, and L Fan participated in all of Sun Ce's battles under Yuan Shu from then on.   It is said that L Fan recommended himself through a game of  Go  - Sun Ce made a bad opening move, and L Fan capitalized upon it, pointing out Sun Ce's mistake. Sun Ce was suitably impressed and offered L Fan a post. Rather than accept a high and lofty position, however, L Fan insisted upon remaining in a low and humble one where he could more effectively manage troops. This also impressed Sun Ce, and the two became inseparable. The game of Go in question, called the ""Sun-L Game"", is purported to be the first Go game to be recorded move for move, but many scholars doubt its authenticity. After this, L Fan was appointed as Chief Controller.   At one point during the beginning of Sun Ce's career, L Fan was sent to bring Sun's family from Guangling to  Qu'a . The governor of  Xu province ,  Tao Qian , despised Sun Ce and sought to imprison L Fan as a spy and torture him, but some retainers freed him, and he was able to successfully rescue Sun Ce's family. L Fan became so trusted by Sun Ce that he was treated the same as a member of Sun's own family, given food and drink before Sun's own mother,  Lady Wu .   L Fan was third only to  Cheng Pu  and  Xu Kun  in terms of merits, following Sun Ce in every battle. His unit defeated and killed  Yan Baihu 's subordinate,  Chen Mu . Later, when Yuan Shu declared himself emperor, Sun Ce declared his independence, and L Fan remained with his forces, and even participated in battle against his former master.  Chen Yu , a man appointed by  Cao Cao  to supposedly aid Sun Ce in the war against Yuan Shu, secretly plotted to destroy Sun Ce from within, but Sun foresaw this and sent L Fan to destroy him. L Fan decisively defeated Chen Yu, and as a result, Chen Yu fled to  Yuan Shao  in the north, never to be heard from again.   Upon his victory over the leader of the remnants of Yuan Shu's forces,  Liu Xun , as well as  Huang Zu  and  Liu Biao  at  Shaxian , Sun Ce submitted a memorial to the emperor, naming L Fan as designated Grand Administrator of Guiyang (an area within Liu Biao's jurisdiction) among other things.   In 200, Sun Ce died of injuries sustained during an assassination attempt, and his brother,  Sun Quan  received his command and seal.   L Fan served as Sun Ce's chief strategist historically, while in popular culture, that role is often fulfilled by Sun's close friend,  Zhou Yu . However, Zhou Yu was absent for many of Sun Ce's campaigns, whereas L Fan was at each one.     [ edit ]   Service under Sun Quan   L Fan served as one of Sun Quan's most trusted civil officers. Initially, before Sun Ce's death, Sun Quan and L Fan had had some disagreement - being young and foolhardy, Sun Quan often took money for personal interests and asked L Fan to fix the books. L Fan, however, remained honest, thus causing Sun Quan to dislike him. After his brother's death, however, Sun Quan matured greatly and admired L Fan's earlier honesty, thus valuing him highly.   In 208, Cao Cao led a fleet down to the  Battle of Red Cliffs  in hopes of destroying his weakened rival,  Liu Bei , and sought Sun Quan's assistance in the matter. At the request of Zhou Yu and others, however, Sun Quan instead opposed Cao Cao and allied with Liu Bei. L Fan participated in the battle, serving as a subordinate to Zhou Yu.   After the victory at Red Cliffs,  Lu Su  suggested ceding the southern part of  Jing province  to Liu Bei. Zhou Yu and L Fan protested against such a plan, but after Zhou Yu's death of illness in 210, Sun Quan agreed to Lu Su's plan instead, even allowing additional concessions to Liu Bei. The resulting diplomatic mess would culminate in open hostilities between Liu Bei and Sun Quan a decade later.   In 223,  Cao Wei  generals  Cao Xiu  and  Zang Ba  launched an attack on  Dongkou . L Fan commanded the defense, leading men such as  Sun Shao  and  Xu Sheng  into battle. Things went poorly for Wu from the start: a heavy wind came and destroyed much of L Fan's fleet, and Cao Xiu attacked viciously. To further add to Eastern Wu's troubles, Sun Quan's younger brother,  Sun Lang , accidentally burnt L Fan's supplies of food and weaponry. Miraculously, Sun Shao and Xu Sheng were able to counterattack, and it was through their hard work that the battle was won.   Afterwards, L Fan was appointed as governor of Yang province and even Commander-in-Chief. However, he died shortly after his appointment in 228. It is said that Sun Quan wept heavily upon his death, crying out his style name at all hours.     [ edit ]   Descendants and Legacy   L was succeeded by two sons, the first of which had died young. The third,  L Ju , succeeded his father's noble rank and was a talented general in his own right. However, in 252, he was part of a plot to overthrow the tyrannical Eastern Wu general,  Sun Lin , and when his part in the plot was discovered, he committed suicide before he could be imprisoned and executed.

Liu Biao emerged victorious against Sun Jian's forces. Shortly after their coalition had ousted  Dong Zhuo  from the capital city,  Luoyang ,  Yuan Shu  and  Yuan Shao , two feudal lords vying for power, had formed alliances against one another, with Sun Jian and  Gongsun Zan  supporting Yuan Shu while  Cao Cao  and Liu Biao supported Yuan Shao. [ 1 ]  Sun Jian was asked by Yuan Shu to attack Liu Biao in order to extinguish Yuan Shao's influence in the southern half of China. Although Sun's forces initially outmanoeuvred and outfought Liu's, Sun Jian himself was killed in battle, forcing his army to retreat.           Contents       1   Battle   2   Aftermath   3   In Romance of the Three Kingdoms   4   Modern references   5   Sources               [ edit ]   Battle   Sun Jian and his forces encountered the forces of Liu Biao's general,  Huang Zu , between  Fancheng  and Deng (near modern day  Xiangfan ). There, he easily routed Huang's forces and surrounded the city of Xiangyang itself. Within the confines of the city, Liu Biao again sent Huang Zu out, this time to make a surprise sortie. However, Huang was again defeated, and when he attempted to withdraw to the city once more, Sun Jian cut off his line of retreat, and he fled to  Xianshan .  [ 2 ]  Wishing to follow up on his success, Sun Jian pursued. According to Sun Jian's  Sanguozhi  biography, he was shot by a soldier in Huang Zu's unit who was hiding in a bamboo grove where he was carried off the battlefield and died.  [ 3 ]  Other theories of Sun Jian's death include Sun Jian fighting in the wilderness and being killed, or being crushed to death by boulders thrown down from above in 193.  [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Aftermath   Sun Jian's death effectively ended the battle, although Liu's forces had suffered far more casualties.  Huan Jie , one of Sun Jian's officers, successfully negotiated for Sun's corpse to be returned, and Sun Jian's army temporarily came under the control of Sun Jian's nephew,  Sun Ben . Sun Ben then went to join Yuan Shu with most of Sun Jian's followers.  Sun Ce , Sun Jian's eldest son, was given Sun Jian's marquisate, but chose to pass the position down to his youngest brother,  Sun Kuang , who was still young. [ 3 ]   [ 2 ]   Liu Biao's success allowed him to expand his influence in the Jing Province. Though he would be unable to defeat either Sun Ce or his successor,  Sun Quan , he would nonetheless remain an influential figure in the Han for the rest of his life.     [ edit ]   In  Romance of the Three Kingdoms   The battle and its justifications were altered somewhat by  Luo Guanzhong  in the Chinese novel,  Romance of the Three Kingdoms . In this fictionalized account, Sun Jian attacks Liu Biao in order to get revenge for Liu Biao's routing of his army during his withdrawal from the coalition against Dong Zhuo. Sun Jian's younger brother,  Sun Jing , attempts to dissuade him from this course of action, though Sun Jian refuses to listen. Sun Ce is granted a command position and does well in his first battle.   After initially defeating Huang Zu, Sun Jian's army surrounds Xiangyang as happened historically. Two fictional officers, Chen Sheng () and Zhang Hu (), are killed quickly by Sun Jian (or, in some versions, Sun Ce) and  Han Dang , respectively. Sun Jian dies in a rockslide rather than being shot, having been lured in by  L Gong  and  Huang Zu  thanks to the strategies of  Kuai Liang .  Huang Gai , Sun Jian's subordinate, manages to capture Huang Zu, and  Cheng Pu  kills  L Gong , but the damage is already done, and Sun Ce is forced to withdraw.   Huan Jie's involvement in recovering Sun Jian's corpse is similar in the novel to what happened historically, though in the novel account, Huang Zu is traded for Sun Jian's corpse. Historically, there is no mention of Huang Zu being captured. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Modern references   The Battle of Xiangyang appears in video games such as  Dynasty Warriors , but the name of the battle changes with almost every release. After Sun Jian is killed, Sun Ce takes command of the army instead of  Sun Ben . How Sun Jian dies changes with each game release possibly to reflect the confusion on how he died.

Founder and  Emperor  of  Eastern Wu       Born   182       Died   252 (aged 70)       Predecessor   Sun Ce       Successor   Sun Liang       Names       Simplified Chinese          Traditional Chinese          Pinyin   Sn Qun       Wade-Giles   Sun Chuan       Courtesy name   Zhngmu ()       Posthumous name   Dongwudadi ()       Era names     Huangwu ()  222229  Huanglong ()  229231  Jiahe ()  232238  Chiwu ()  238251  Taiyuan ()  251252  Shenfeng ()  252           This is a  Chinese name ; the  family name  is   Sun  () .     Sun Quan  ( traditional Chinese :   ;  simplified Chinese :   ;  pinyin : Sn Qun;  Wade-Giles : Sun Chuan) (182 - 252), son of  Sun Jian , courtesy name  Zhngmu  (), formally  Emperor Da of (Eastern) Wu  was the founder of  Eastern Wu , during the  Three Kingdoms  period, in  China . He ruled from 222 to 229 as  Wu  Wang  (King/Prince of Wu) and from 229 to 252 as Emperor of the Wu Dynasty.   In his youth Sun Quan spent time in his home county of Fuchun, and after his father's death in the early 190s, at various cities on the Lower  Yangtze River . His elder brother  Sun Ce  carved out a warlord state in the region, based on his own followers and a number of local clan allegiances. When Sun Ce was assassinated by the retainers of  Xu Gong , whom Sun Ce had killed in battle several years prior, in 200, the eighteen-year-old Sun Quan inherited the lands southeast of the  Yangtze River  from his brother. His administration proved to be relatively stable in those early years. Sun Jian and Sun Ce's most senior officers, such as  Zhou Yu ,  Zhang Zhao ,  Zhang Hong , and  Cheng Pu  remained loyal; in fact it was mentioned in  Romance of the Three Kingdoms  that Sun Ce had at his deathbed reminded Sun Quan that ""in internal matters, consult Zhang Zhao, in external matters, consult Zhou Yu."" Thus throughout the 200s Sun Quan under the tutelage of his able advisors continued to build up his strength along the Yangtze River. In early 207, his forces finally won complete victory over  Huang Zu , a military leader under  Liu Biao , who dominated the Middle Yangtze.   In winter of that year, the northern warlord  Cao Cao  led an army of some 200,000 to conquer south to complete the reunification of China. Two distinct factions emerged at his court on how to handle the situation. One, led by Zhang Zhao, urged surrender whilst the other, led by Zhou Yu and the young diplomat  Lu Su , opposed capitulation. In the finality, Sun Quan decided to oppose Cao Cao in the Middle Yangtze with his superior riverine forces. Allied with the refugee warlord  Liu Bei  and employing the combined strategies of  Zhou Yu  and  Huang Gai , they defeated Cao Cao decisively at the  Battle of Red Cliffs .   In 220,  Cao Pi , son of Cao Cao, seized the throne and proclaimed himself to be the  Emperor of China , ending the nominal rule of the  Han Dynasty . At first Sun Quan nominally served as a Cao Wei vassal with the Cao Wei-created title of Prince of Wu, but after Cao Pi demanded that he send his son  Sun Deng  as a hostage to the Cao Wei capital  Luoyang  and he refused, in 222, he declared himself independent by changing  era name . It was not until the year 229 that he formally declared himself to be  emperor .   Because of his skill in gathering important, honourable men to his cause, Sun Quan was able to delegate authority to capable figures. This primary strength served him well in gaining the support of the common people and surrounding himself with capable generals.   Sun Quan died in 252 at the age of 70. He enjoyed the longest reign among all the founders of the Three Kingdoms. He was succeeded as Emperor of Eastern Wu by his son  Sun Liang .

After his father's death in 191, he became the charge of his brother  Sun Ce . Sun has greenish-blue eyes and redish hair. As he grew up, he became an officer under his brother during his brother's conquest of the region south of the  Yangtze River . He was made a county magistrate in 196, at age 14, and continued to rise through the ranks as his brother gave him more and more important tasks.   The  Sanguo Zhi  records that Sun Quan's father  Sun Jian  was a descendant of  Sun Tzu , the great military strategist of the  Warring States  period. According to later tradition, Sun Quan was born on Sunzhou (""Sun Island"", later Wangzhou - ""King's Island""), an islet at the intersection of the  Fuchun River  and one of its tributaries. Local  folklore  relates a story about how Sun Quan's grandfather Sun Zhong was originally a melon farmer on the islet.     [ edit ]   As warlord after Sun Ce's death     [ edit ]   Prior to the Battle of Red Cliffs   Sun Ce was assassinated in 200 during a hunt. On his deathbed, he knew that his son was still too young to be considered a realistic heir, so he entrusted the 18-year-old Sun Quan to his faithful subordinates. Initially, Sun Quan mourned so greatly that he could do nothing, but at  Zhang Zhao 's behest, he changed into a general's clothing and set out to visit the commanderies under his brother's control. Many of Sun Ce's subordinates thought that Sun Quan was too young to sustain Sun Ce's domain and wanted to leave, but Zhang and  Zhou Yu  saw special qualities in the young man and chose to stay to serve Sun Quan.  Zhang Hong , whom Sun Ce had earlier sent as a liaison to the paramount warlord  Cao Cao , also returned from Cao's domain to assist Sun Quan. (At Zhang Hong's request, Cao, in the name of  Emperor Xian , commissioned Sun Quan as General Taolu (), a title that he would be known for a long time.) He listened carefully to his mother Lady Wu's encouraging words, and greatly trusted Zhang Zhao and Zhang Hong with regard to civilian affairs and Zhou,  Cheng Pu , and  L Fan  with regard to military matters. He also sought out talented young men to serve as his personal advisors, and it was around this time that he befriended  Lu Su  and  Zhuge Jin , who would later play prominent roles in his administration. Throughout this period and decades to come, Sun Quan's leadership would be characterized by his ability to find men of character and entrust important matters to him, and his ability to react swiftly to events.   For the next several years, Sun Quan was largely interested in first defending his realm against potential enemies, but he gradually sought to harass and weaken  Liu Biao 's key subordinate,  Huang Zu  (who controlled the northeastern region of Liu's domain) -- particularly because Huang had killed his father Sun Jian in battle. In 208, he was finally able to defeat Huang Zu and kill him in battle. Soon after, Liu Biao himself died while Cao Cao was preparing a major campaign to subjugate both Liu Biao and Sun Quan under his control, precipitating a major confrontation.     [ edit ]   Battle of Red Cliffs       Main article:  Battle of Red Cliffs       After Liu Biao's death, a succession struggle for his domain came into being, between his sons  Liu Qi  and younger son  Liu Cong , whom Liu Biao's second wife  Lady Cai  favored (because he had married her niece). After Huang's death, Liu Qi was therefore given Huang's post as the governor of Jiangxia Commandery (roughly modern  Huanggang ,  Hubei ). Liu Cong therefore succeeded Liu Biao after his death, and Liu Qi was displeased and considered, but did not carry out, an attack against his brother. Nevertheless, Liu Cong, in fear of having to fight Cao Cao and his brother on two fronts, surrendered to Cao Cao against the advice of Liu Biao's key ally  Liu Bei . Liu Bei, unwilling to submit to Cao Cao, fled south. Cao Cao caught up to him and crushed his forces, but Liu Bei escaped with his life; he fled to Dangyang (, in modern  Yichang ,  Hubei ). Cao Cao took over most of Jing Province, and appeared set on finally unifying the empire.   Sun Quan was well aware of Cao's intentions, and he quickly entered into an alliance with Liu Bei and Liu Qi to prepare for a Cao assault. Cao Cao wrote Sun with a letter intending to intimidate, and in face of Cao Cao's overwhelming force (estimated to be about 220,000 men, although Cao Cao claimed 800,000, against Sun Quan owned 30,000 and the Lius' combined force of 10,000), many of Sun Quan subordinates, even including the highly capable Zhang Zhao, advocated surrender. Sun Quan refused, under advice from Zhou Yu and Lu Su (that Cao Cao would surely not tolerate him even if he surrendered).   Sun put Zhou in charge of his 30,000 men, largely stationed on naval ships, and Zhou set up in a defense position in conjunction with Liu Bei, whose army was stationed on land. About this time, there was a plague developing in Cao's forces which significantly weakened it. Zhou set up a trap where he pretended to be punishing his subordinate  Huang Gai , and Huang Gai pretended to be in such fear that he was willing to surrender to Cao. Zhou then sent ships under Huang's command to pretend to surrender and, as Huang's ships approached Cao's fleet, they were lit on fire to assault Cao's fleet, and Cao's fleet was largely destroyed by fire. Cao led his forces to escape on land, but much of the force was destroyed by Sun Quan and Liu Bei's land forces. The death rate was said to be over 50%.     [ edit ]   Uneasy alliance with Liu Bei   Immediately, after Cao Cao withdrew, Sun Quan took over the northern half of Jing Province. Liu Bei marched south and took over the southern half. The Sun-Liu alliance was further cemented by a marriage of Sun Quan's sister to Liu Bei. Zhou was suspicious of Liu Bei intentions, however, and suggested to Sun Quan that Liu Bei be seized and put under house arrest (albeit be very well-treated) and his forces be merged into Sun Quan's; Sun Quan, believing that Liu Bei's forces would rebel if he did that, declined. Sun Quan did agree to Zhou Yu's plans to consider attacking Liu Zhang and  Zhang Lu  (who controlled the modern southern  Shaanxi ) to try to take over their territories, but after Zhou Yu died in 210, the plans were abandoned. However, Sun Quan was able to persuade the warlords in modern  Guangdong ,  Guangxi , and northern  Vietnam  to submit to him, and they became part of his domain. He then yielded northern Jing to Liu Bei as well, agreeing with Liu Bei that southern Jing was insufficient to supply his troops.   In 215, the Sun-Liu alliance appeared on the verge of break-up, because Sun Quan demanded that Liu Bei return Jing Province and Liu refused. Sun Quan made an initial attack against Liu Bei's general  Guan Yu , who was left in charge of Jing Province by Liu Bei, and most of the eastern Jing Province (east of the  Xiang River ) quickly surrendered. However, after a face-to-face summit between Guan Yu and Lu, the sides renewed their alliance, dividing Jing Province at the Xiang.     [ edit ]   Breaking of alliance with Liu Bei   In 219,  Guan Yu  advanced north, attacking  Fancheng , scoring a major victory over Cao's nephew  Cao Ren . While Fancheng did not fall at this time, Guan put it under siege, and the situation was severe enough that Cao Cao considered moving the capital away from Xu. However, Sun, resentful of Guan's prior constant instigation of hostilities (including seizing Sun's food supplies to use for his campaign north), took the opportunity to attack Guan from the rear, and Guan's forces collapsed. Guan was captured by Sun's general  L Meng ; once captured, Sun Quan executed Guan Yu, Jing Province became Sun's once more, and the Sun-Liu alliance was over. Sun instead nominally submitted to Cao and, indeed, urged him to take the throne. Cao declined, but prepared for his son  Cao Pi  to do so.   After Cao Cao's death in 220, Cao Pi did indeed force Emperor Xian to yield the throne to him, ending the Han Dynasty and establishing  Cao Wei . Sun did not immediately declare himself a Cao Wei subject or declare independence after Cao Pi's enthronement, but took a wait-and-see attitude; by contrast, in early 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor, establishing  Shu Han . Immediately, Liu planned a campaign against Sun to avenge Guan. After attempting to negotiate peace and receiving no positive response from Liu, fearing attack on both sides, Sun declared himself a Cao Wei subject. Cao Pi's strategist  Liu Ye  suggested that Cao decline -- and in fact attack Sun on a second front, effectively partitioning Sun's domain with Shu Han, and then eventually seek to destroy Shu Han as well. Cao declined, in a fateful choice that most historians believe doomed his empire to ruling only the northern and central China -- and this chance would not come again. Indeed, against Liu Ye's advice, he created Sun the Prince of Wu and granted him the  nine bestowments .   In 222, at the  Battle of Xiaoting , Sun's general  Lu Xun  dealt Liu a major defeat, stopping the Shu Han offensive. Shu Han would not again pose a threat to Sun from that point on. Later that year, when Cao Pi demanded that Sun send his  crown prince   Sun Deng  to the Cao Wei capital  Luoyang  as a hostage (to guarantee his loyalty), Sun refused and declared independence (by changing  era name ), thus establishing Eastern Wu as an independent state. Cao Pi therefore launched a major attack on Eastern Wu, but after Cao Wei defeats in early 223, it became clear that Eastern Wu was secure. After Liu Bei's death later that year, Zhuge Jin's brother  Zhuge Liang , the regent for Liu Bei's son and successor  Liu Shan , reestablished the alliance with Sun Quan, and the two states would remain allies until Shu Han's eventual destruction in 263.     [ edit ]   Reign as the monarch of Eastern Wu     [ edit ]   Early reign   Early in Sun Quan's reign, the Eastern Wu administration was known for its efficiency, as Sun showed a knack for listening to correct advice and for delegating authorities to the proper individuals. For example, he correctly trusted the faithful Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin, so much so that he made a duplicate imperial seal and left it with Lu; whenever he would correspond with Shu Han's emperor Liu Shan or regent Zhuge Liang, he would deliver the letter to Lu first (as Lu's post was near the Shu Han border), and then if, in Lu's opinion, changes were needed, he would revise the letter and then restamp it with Sun's imperial seal. Further, Lu and Zhuge Jin were authorized to coordinate their actions with Shu Han without prior imperial approval. Sun treated his high level officials as friends and addressed them accordingly (with courtesy names), and in accordance they dedicated all effort to Eastern Wu's preservation. He also knew what were the proper roles for officials that he trusted; for example, in 225, when selecting a prime minister, while the key officials all respected Zhang Zhao greatly and wanted him to be prime minister, Sun declined -- reasoning that while he respected Zhang greatly, a prime minister needed to handle all affairs of state, and Zhang, while capable, had such strong opinions that he would surely be in conflict with Sun and other officials at all times. He also repeatedly promoted his official  L Fan  even though, while he was young, L had informed to Sun Ce about his improper spending habits, understanding that L did so only out of loyalty to Sun Ce.   In 224 and 225, Cao Pi again made attacks on Eastern Wu, but each time the Eastern Wu forces were able to repel Cao Wei's with fair ease -- so easily that Cao made the comment, ""Heaven created the Yangtze to divide the north and south."" However, Sun was himself equally unsuccessful in efforts to make major attacks on Cao Wei. After Cao Pi's death in 226, for example, Sun launched an attack on Cao Wei's Jiangxia Commandery (roughly modern  Xiaogan ,  Hubei ) but was forced to withdraw as soon as Cao Wei relief forces arrived despite Cao Pi's recent death. However, later that year, he was able to increase his effective control over Jiao Province (, modern northern  Vietnam ) when his general  L Dai  was able to defeat the warlord Shi Hui () and end the effective independence that the Shi clan had. In addition, the several independent kingdoms in modern  Cambodia ,  Laos , and southern  Vietnam  all became Eastern Wu vassals as well.   The one major victory that Eastern Wu would have over Cao Wei during this period came in 228, when, with Sun's approval, his general  Zhou Fang  pretended to be surrendering to Cao Wei after pretending to have been punished repeatedly by Sun. This tricked the Cao Wei general  Cao Xiu , who led a large army south to support Zhou. He walked into the trap set by Zhou and Lu Xun and suffered major losses, but was saved from total annihilation by  Jia Kui .   In 229, Sun declared himself emperor, which almost damaged the alliance with Shu Han, as many Shu Han officials saw this as a sign of betrayal of the Han Dynasty -- which Shu Han claimed to be the legitimate successor to. However, Zhuge Liang opposed ending the alliance and in fact confirmed it with a formal treaty later that year, in which the two states pledged to support each other and divide Cao Wei equally if they could conquer it. Later that year, he moved his capital from Wuchang (, in modern  Ezhou ,  Hubei ) to  Jianye , leaving his crown prince Sun Deng, assisted by Lu Xun, in charge of the western empire.     [ edit ]   Middle reign   In 230, however, the first sign of the deterioration of Sun Quan's reign occurred. That year, he sent his generals Wei Wen () and Zhuge Zhi () with a navy of 10,000 into the  East China Sea  to seek the legendary islands of Yizhou (, may be modern  Taiwan ) and Danzhou (, may be modern  Japan ) to seek to conquer them, despite strenuous opposition of Lu Xun and  Quan Cong . The navy was not able to locate Danzhou but located Yizhou, and returned in 231 after capturing several thousand men -- but only after 80-90% of the navy had died of illnesses. Instead of seeing his own fault in this venture, Sun simply executed Wei Wen and Zhuge Zhi. Perhaps concerned about this deterioration in Sun Quan's judgment, Sun Deng left the western empire in Lu's hands in 232 and returned in Jianye, and would remain at Jianye until his own death in 241.   In 232, Sun had another misadventure involving his navy -- as he sent his generals Zhou He () and Pei Qian () to the nominal Cao Wei vassal  Gongsun Yuan , in control of Liaodong Commandery (modern central  Liaoning ), to purchase horses, against the advice of  Yu Fan  -- and indeed, he exiled Yu to the desolate Cangwu Commandery (roughly modern  Wuzhou ,  Guangxi ) as punishment. Just as Yu predicted, however, the venture would end in failure -- as Zhou and Pei, on their way back, were intercepted by Cao Wei forces and killed. Regretting his actions, Sun tried to recall Yu back to Jianye, only to learn that Yu had died in exile.   The next year, however, Sun would have yet another misadventure in his dealings with Gongsun, as Gongsun sent messengers to him, offering to be his subject. Sun was ecstatic, and created Gongsun the Prince of Yan and granted him the  nine bestowments , and further sent a detachment of 10,000 men by sea north to assist Gongsun in his campaign against Cao Wei, against the advice of nearly every single one of his high level officials, particularly Zhang Zhao. Once the army arrived, however, Gongsun betrayed them, killing Sun's officials Zhang Mi () and Xu Yan (), whom Sun had sent to grant the bestowments and seized their troops. Once that happened, the enraged Sun wanted to personally head north with a fleet to attack Gongsun, and initially, not even Lu's opposition was able to stop him, although he eventually calmed down and did not follow through. To his credit, he also personally went to Zhang's house and apologized to Zhang. Further, despite the deterioration in his previous clear thinking, he was still capable of making proper decisions at times. For example, in 235, when, as a sign of contempt, Cao Wei's emperor  Cao Rui  offered horses to him in exchange for pearls, jade, and tortoise shells, Sun ignored the implicit insult and made the exchange, reasoning that his empire needed horses much more than pearls, jade, or tortoise shells.   In 234, in coordination with Zhuge Liang's final  northern expedition  against Cao Wei, Sun personally led a major attack against Cao Wei's border city  Hefei , while having Lu and Zhuge Jin attack  Xiangyang , with the strategy of trying to attract Cao Wei relief forces and then attacking them. However, Cao Wei's generals correctly saw the situation and simply let Sun siege Hefei. Only after Sun's food supplies ran low did  Cao Rui  personally arrive with relief forces, and Sun withdrew, as did Lu and Zhuge. (This would prove to be the first of only two coordinated efforts made by allies Eastern Wu and Shu Han against Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period.)   In 238, when Gongsun was under attack by Cao Wei's general  Sima Yi , Sun, despite his prior rage against Gongsun, correctly judged the situation as one where he might be able to take advantage if Sima were initially unsuccessful, did not immediately refuse Gongsun's request for help. However, as Sima was able to conquer Gongsun quickly, Sun never launched the major attack that he considered if Sima got stuck in a stalemate with Gongsun. That year, he also recognized how his head secretary L Yi () had been falsely accusing his officials, and had L executed; he then further confirmed his trust in the high level officials by personally writing an emotional letter to Zhuge Jin,  Bu Zhi ,  Zhu Ran , and  L Dai , blaming himself for the recent problems with his administration while urging them to speak out honestly whenever they saw faults in him.   In 241, Sun would launch the last major assault against Cao Wei of his reign, in light of Cao Rui's death in 239, but he rejected a strategy offered by Yin Zha () to attack Cao Wei in coordinated effort with Shu Han on four different fronts, and the campaign ended in failure as well.     [ edit ]   Late reign   Later in 241, Crown Prince Deng died -- an event that left open the issue of succession and appeared to mark the start of a precipitous decline in Sun Quan's mental health. In 242, he created his son  Sun He , by Consort Wang, crown prince. However, he also favored another son by Consort Wang, Sun Ba () the Prince of Lu, and permitted Sun Ba to have the same staffing level as the crown prince -- a move that was objected to by a number of officials as encouraging Prince Ba to compete with Prince He, but Sun Quan did not listen to them. After 245, when Crown Prince He and Prince Ba began to have separate residences, their relationship detriorated further, and Prince Ba began to scheme at how to seize heir status from Prince He. Fanned by gossip from his daughter Sun Dahu (), Sun Quan blamed the princes' mother Consort Wang for this -- and she died in fear. He also cut off Crown Prince He and Prince Ba's access to the officials who supported them in hopes of receiving future favors, but this could not stop Prince Ba's machinations. Indeed, when Lu Xun tried to intervene to protect Crown Prince He, Prince Ba falsely accused him of many crimes, and Sun Quan became provoked so much that he repeatedly rebuked Lu -- causing Lu to die in anger.   In 250, fed up with Prince Ba's constant attacks against Crown Prince He, Sun Quan carried out an inexplicable combination of actions -- he forced Prince Ba to commit suicide, while deposing Crown Prince He (who had not been shown to have committed any crimes), and instead creating his youngest son,  Sun Liang , crown prince to replace Prince He. This move was opposed by his son-in-law  Zhu Ju  (the husband of Princess Xiaohu), but Zhu's pleas not only did not help Prince He, but also resulted in his own death, as Sun forced him to commit suicide. Many other officials who also opposed the move, as well as officials who had supported Prince Ba, were executed.   Around this time, Sun also had his generals destroy a number of levees near the border with Cao Wei, creating large areas of flooding, in order to obstruct potential attacks from Cao Wei.   In 251, Sun created the first empress of his reign -- Crown Prince Liang's mother  Consort Pan . (Previously, he had a succession of wives, but never created any of them empresses, except that his favorite, Lady Bu, was created empress posthumously after her death in 238.) Later that year, however, he realized that Prince He was blameless and wanted to recall him from his exile, but was persuaded not to do so by his daughter Princess Dahu and  Sun Jun , who had supported Crown Prince Liang's ascension. He realized that he was getting very old (69 by this point) and, at Sun Jun's recommendation, commissioned Zhuge Jin's son  Zhuge Ke  as the future regent for Crown Prince Liang -- even though he correctly had misgivings about how Zhuge Ke was arrogant and had overly high opinion of his own abilities -- because at that time, virtually the entire empire, awed by Zhuge's prior military victories, was convinced that Zhuge would be the correct choice for regent.   In 252, as Sun Quan neared death, Empress Pan was murdered -- but how she was murdered remains a controversy. Eastern Wu officials claimed that her servants, unable to stand her temper, strangled her while she was asleep, while a number of historians, including  Hu Sansheng , the commentator to  Sima Guang 's  Zizhi Tongjian , believed that top Eastern Wu officials were complicit, as they feared that she would seize power as  empress dowager  after Sun's death. Later that year, Sun died at the age of 70, and Crown Prince Liang succeeded him. Sun Quan was buried in a mausoleum at  Purple Mountain  in present-day  Nanjing .     [ edit ]   Modern references          Sun Quan as he appears in  Koei 's  Dynasty Warriors 6 .       Sun Quan is a playable character in the  Koei  video game series,  Dynasty Warriors . He is portrayed as a stolid man with an intensely serious personality, which is in stark contrast to his brother,  Sun Ce , who is informal and care-free.   Sun Quan was portrayed by  Chang Chen  in the 2008 movie  Red Cliff , directed by  John Woo .

The work is considered to be a prime example of Taoist strategy. Whether or not he is an authentic historical figure is vigorously debated by historians. Traditional accounts place him in the  Spring and Autumn Period  of China (722481 BC) as a heroic general of the King of Wu that lived c. 544496 BC. Scholars accepting his  historicity  place his writing of the  Art of War  in the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC), based on the descriptions of warfare in the text. Traditional accounts state that his descendant,  Sun Bin , also wrote a master treatise on military tactics. Sun Tzu, both as an author of the  Art of War  and a legendary figure, had an immense impact on Chinese and Asian history and culture. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the  Art of War  gained popularity and saw practical use in Western society. He remains highly influential in both Asian and Western culture and politics.  Biography  Historians debate whether or not Sun Tzu was a real historical figure. According to traditional sources, such as the  2nd century BC  biography written by  Sima Qian , Sun Tzu is born in  Qi  during the  Spring and Autumn Period  of China (722481 BC) and becomes a heroic general for the king of  Wu ,  Hel . His victories inspire him to write the  Art of War . Historians commonly place the writing of the  Art of War  in the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC), based on its description of warfare. It was a time of constant war between seven nations ( Zhao , Qi,  Qin ,  Chu ,  Han ,  Wei  and  Yan ) seeking to control all of China. According to Sima Qian, the king of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skill, commanding him to train a  harem  of three hundred and sixty  concubines . Sun Tzu divided them into two  companies , appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. Sun Tzu received giggles when he first commanded the companies, telling them in response that the general is at fault if his soldiers do not understand. He taught them the maneuver again, and again they laughed and tittered. Sun Tzu ordered the execution of the two favored concubines, to the king's vigorous protest. He explained that if his soldiers understand but do not obey, it is the fault of the  officers . Sun Tzu also said once a general receives his orders, it is his duty to carry them out perfectly, even if the king protests. New officers were named and the two companies performed their maneuvers flawlessly thereafter. According to this biography, Sun Tzu further proved his theories on the battlefield with a successful military career and wrote the Art of War based on his tested expertise. His descendant,  Sun Bin , also became a famous scholar of the military arts.   Historicity   Skeptical scholars have expressed doubt in Sun Tzu's historicity and the traditional dating of the  Art of War . This skepticism is fueled by a variety of factors including historical inaccuracies and anachronisms in the text, as well as the unlikelihood of story involving the execution of the king's favorite concubines. Increasing skepticism, even to the point of completely denying the existence of a historical figure named Sun Wu (Sun Tzu), has lead to acrimonious debate between skeptics and traditionalists, especially in  China . Attribution of the authorship of the  Art of War  varies among scholars, including Sun Tzu, the famous Chu scholar  Wu Zixu , another unknown author, a school of thought in Qi or Wu, and Sun Bin.  Traditionalists attribute the authorship of the  Art of War  to the historical figure Sun Wu, who is chronicled in the  Records of the Grand Historian  and the  Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue . He was reputedly active in the early sixth century BCE, beginning c. 512 BCE. The appearance of features from the  Art of War  in other historical texts is considered to be proof of his historicity and authorship. Certain strategic concepts, such as terrain classification, are attributed to Sun Tzu. Their use in other works, such as by the compilers of  The Methods of the Sima , is consider proof of Sun Tzu's historical priority. Other scholars have identified a number of issues with the traditionalist view. They point to a number of anachronisms in the  Art of War  that include terms, technology, philosophical ideas, events and military techniques. There is a disparity between the large scale wars and sophisticated techniques detailed in the text and the small scale, more primitive battles that predominated during the sixth century BCE. There is also a lack of contemporary evidence supporting the centuries later accounts of Sun Tzu. For example, there is no corroborating support for Sun Wu's role in the wars between Wu and  Yue  in the  Zuo Zhuan , considered the authoritative record of the period. Regardless of Sun Tzu's historicity or the actual authorship of the  Art of War , the figure of Sun Tzu and his traditionally attributed work have been vastly influential.  The Art of War The Art of War  is said to have been penned by Sun Tzu and was originally called the  Sun Tzu Ping Fa  ( Pinyin :  Sunzi Bingfa ), or simply the  Sun Tzu . It presents a complete  philosophy of war  for managing conflicts and winning clear victories. Contrary to popular perceptions, it contains not only the writing of the original author, but also commentary and clarifications from later military philosophers, such as  Li Quan  and  Du Mu . It is widely accepted as a masterpiece on strategy and has been referenced by generals and theorists throughout history. Sun Tzu makes use of language that would be unusual for a Western text on warfare and strategy. For example, the eleventh chapter of the book states that a leader must be ""serene and inscrutable"", capable of comprehending ""unfathomable plans"". The text is filled with similar remarks that are often confusing to a Western audience. The meaning of such statements are clearer when interpreted in the context of  Taoist  thought and practice. Sun Tzu viewed the ideal general as an  enlightened  Taoist master. The  Art of War  is distinguished from its Western counterparts, Clausewitz's  On War  for example, by this spiritual dimension. Awareness of the Taoist viewpoint of the  Art of War  is essential to understanding the intended meaning of the classic. The book is not only popular among military theorists, but also among political leaders and those in  business management . The book addresses  strategy  in a broad fashion, despite the title, touching upon  public administration  and planning. The text outlines theories of battle but also advocates  diplomacy  and cultivating relationships with other nations as essential to the health of the state. Of the texts written before the  unification of China , six major works survived, including Sun Tzu's classic. During the  Song Dynasty , these six works were combined with a  Tang Dynasty  text into the collection called the  Seven Military Classics . As part of that compilation, the  Art of War  formed the foundations of orthodox military theory in China and was required reading to pass the tests needed for imperial appointment to military positions.  Related texts  During the early 1970s, scholars uncovered a large collection of ancient texts written in amazingly preserved  bamboo slips . Among them were the Art of War and Sun Bin's  Military Methods . Although  Military Methods  was noted by  Han Dynasty  bibliographies as extant and written by a descendant of Sun Tzu, it had since been lost. The finding of Sun Bin's work was considered an extremely important find, due to a variety of factors including Sun Bin's relationship to Sun Tzu and the work's illustration of military thought in late Chinese antiquity. The discovery as a whole expanded the total known Chinese military works by hundreds, though Sun Bin's text is the only known additional surviving text from the ancient period.  Influence and importance  Sun Tzu's  Art of War  has been deeply influential. It is said the first emperor of a unified China,  Qin Shi Huang , thought the book invaluable in ending the Age of Warring States. Japan was introduced to Sun Tzu's work c. AD 760, quickly becoming popular among her generals. It is considered an important influence on the unification of Japan. Mastery of its teachings was considered a mark of respect among the  samurai  and several influential samurai both exhorted and exemplified its teachings, such as "

Sun played an instrumental role in overthrowing the  Qing Dynasty  in 1911. He was the first provisional  president  when the  Republic of China  (ROC) was founded in 1912 and later co-founded the  Kuomintang  (KMT) where he served as its first leader. Sun was a uniting figure in  post-Imperial China , and remains unique among 20th-century  Chinese  politicians for being widely revered in both  Mainland China  and  Taiwan .   Although Sun is considered one of the greatest leaders of modern  China , his political life was one of constant struggle and frequent  exile . After the success of the revolution, he quickly fell out of power in the newly-founded Republic of China, and led successive revolutionary governments as a challenge to the  warlords  who controlled much of the nation. Sun did not live to see his party  consolidate its power  over the country. His party, which formed a fragile alliance with the  Communists , split into two factions after his death. Sun's chief legacy resides in his developing a  political philosophy  known as the  Three Principles of the People  (The People's Relation/Connection, The People's Power, and  the People's Livelihood/Welfare , or sometimes known as  nationalism ,  democracy / sovereignty , and  socialism / populism / livelihood  depending on the translation).

Sun Yat-sen's birthplace and birthdate are unclear. His birth certificate issued by the  Territory of Hawaii  substantiates that he was born in the  Kingdom of Hawaii  on 24 November 1870, [ 4 ]  but it is commonly assumed that he was born on 12 November 1866 to a  peasant  family in the village of  Cuiheng ,  Xiangshan  county,  Guangzhou  prefecture,  Guangdong  province (26 km or 16 miles north of  Macau ). When he died in 1925, the name of Xiangshan was changed to Zhongshan, Sun's Japanese name when he was living in Japan. As a child, Sun Yat-sen listened to many stories about the  Taiping Rebellion  from an old Taiping soldier named Lai han-ying (""). After receiving a few years of local school, at age thirteen, Sun went to live with his elder brother, Sun Mei, in  Honolulu . Sun Mei, who was fifteen years Sun Yat-sen's senior, had emigrated to  Hawaii  as a laborer and had become a prosperous  merchant . Though Sun Mei was not always supportive of Sun's later revolutionary activities, he supported his brother financially, allowing Sun to give up his professional career. Sun Yat-sen studied at the prestigious  Iolani School  where he learned English, mathematics and science. Originally unable to speak the English language, Sun Yat-sen picked up the language so quickly that he received a prize for outstanding achievement in English from  King David Kalakaua . While at Iolani, he befriended Tong Phong, who later founded the First Chinese-American Bank. After attending Iolani School in 1882, [ 5 ]  Sun enrolled in  Oahu College  (now  Punahou School ) for further studies for one semester, from which he graduated. [ 6 ]  He was soon sent home to China as his brother was becoming afraid that Sun Yat-sen was about to embrace  Christianity , but he returned to Hawaii at least twice, in 1903 and 1910. [ 7 ]  In 1904 his alleged birth in Hawaii was certified. As a consequence, he was automatically declared a citizen of the United States and was issued an American passport. It is unclear whether or not he maintained his original citizenship as a subject of the Qing empire.   His American experience was to be of lasting influence. Sun attached particular importance to the ideas of  Alexander Hamilton  and  Abraham Lincoln . Sun often said that the formulation of Lincoln's  Gettysburg Address , government of the people, by the people, for the people, had been the inspiration for the  Three Principles of the People . He incorporated these ideas, later in life, in two highly influential books. One,  The Vital Problem of China  (1917), analyzed some of the problems of  colonialism : Sun warned that &the  British  treat nations as the  silkworm  farmer treats his worms; as long as they produce  silk , he cares for them well; when they stop, he feeds them to the fish. The second book,  International Development of China  (1921), presented detailed proposals for the development of  infrastructure  in China, and attacked the ideology of  laissez-faire , as well as that of  Marxism  adhering more to the ideas of  Henry George 's, particularly  land value taxation . His ideology remained flexible, however, reflecting his audience as much as his personal convictions. He presented himself as a strident  nationalist  to the nationalists, as a  socialist  to the socialists, and an  anarchist  to the anarchists, declaring at one point that the goal of the  Three Principles of the People  is to create socialism and  anarchism . It is an open matter of debate whether this eclecticism reflected a sincere effort to incorporate ideas from the multiple competing schools of thought or was simply opportunistic posturing. In any case, his ideological flexibility allowed him to become a key figure in the Nationalist movement since he was one of very few people who had good relations with all of the movement's factions. When he returned home in 1883, he became greatly troubled by what he saw as a backward China that demanded exorbitant taxes and levies from its people. The schools maintained their ancient methods, leaving no opportunity for expression of thought or opinion. Under the influence of Christian missionaries in Hawaii, Sun had developed a disdain for traditional Chinese religious beliefs. One day, Sun and his childhood friend  Lu Hao-tung  passed by  Beijidian  (u), a temple in Cuiheng Village, where they saw many villagers worshipping the Beiji (literally  North Pole ) Emperor-God in the temple. They broke off the hand of the statue, incurring the wrath of fellow villagers, and escaped to  Hong Kong .   Sun studied English at the Anglican Diocesan Home and Orphanage (now the  Diocesan Boys' School ) in Hong Kong. In April 1884, Sun was transferred to the Central School of Hong Kong (later renamed  Queen's College ). Sun was later baptized in Hong Kong by an American missionary of the Congregational Church of the United States, to his brother's disdain. Sun pictured a  revolution  as similar to the salvation mission of the Christian church. His conversion to Christianity was related to his revolutionary ideals and push for advancement [ 3 ] . As a result, his baptismal name, Rixin (  ), literally means ""daily renewal.""

The one standing was Guan Jingliang.).       Sun studied medicine at the  Guangzhou Boji Hospital  under the medical missionary  John G. Kerr . Ultimately, he earned the license of medical practice as a  medical doctor  from the  Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese  (the forerunner of  The University of Hong Kong ) in 1892, of which he was one of the first two graduates. He subsequently practiced medicine in that city briefly in 1893. He had an  arranged marriage  with fellow villager  Lu Muzhen  at age twenty; she bore him a son  Sun Fo , who would grow up to become a high ranking official in the Republican government, and two daughters, Sun Yan and Sun Wan.   During and after the  Qing Dynasty  rebellion, Sun was a leader within  Tiandihui , a precursor to modern  triad  groups. Tiandihui provided much of Sun's funding. His protg,  Chiang Kai Shek , was also a member of Tiandihui .     [ edit ]   Transformation into a revolutionary   Sun, who had grown increasingly troubled by the conservative Qing government and its refusal to adopt knowledge from the more technologically advanced Western nations, quit his medical practice in order to devote his time to transforming China. At first, Sun aligned himself with the reformists  Kang Youwei  and  Liang Qichao  who sought to transform China into a Western-style constitutional monarchy. In 1894, Sun wrote a long letter to  Li Hongzhang , the governor-general of  Zhili  and a reformer in the court, with suggestions on how to strengthen China, but he was rebuffed. Since Sun had never been trained in the classics, the gentry did not accept Sun into their circles. From then on, Sun began to call for the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic.   Sun went to Hawaii in October 1894 and founded the  Revive China Society  to unveil the goal of a prospering China and as the platform for future revolutionary activities. Members were drawn mainly from fellow Cantonese expatriates and from the lower social classes.     [ edit ]   From exile to Wuchang Uprising          Plaque in London marking the site of a house where Sun Yat-sen lived while in exile       In 1895 a  coup  he plotted failed, and for the next sixteen years Sun was an  exile  in Europe, the  United States ,  Canada , and  Japan , raising money for his revolutionary party and bankrolling uprisings in China. In 1896 he was detained at the  Chinese Legation in London , where diplomats planned to kill him. He was released after twelve days through the efforts of  James Cantlie ,  The Times  and the  Foreign Office , leaving Sun a hero in  Britain . [ 8 ]   In Japan, where he was known as Nakayama ShM ( Kanji :  -q5 , lit. 'Middle Mountain Woodsman'), he joined  dissident  Chinese groups (which later became the  Tongmenghui ) and soon became their leader. He spent, on and off, about ten years in Japan while befriending and being financially aided by a democratic revolutionary in Japan, Miyazaki Toten (1871-1922). Nanjing Historical Remains Museum of Chinese Modern History exhibits a bronze statue of Sun and Miyazaki placed alongside. Miyazaki wrote a series of articles for newspapers including nationally-circulated Asahi about Sun and his revolutionary efforts under the title ""33-year dream"". His last name Nakayama came from the imperial family which occupied Sun's favorite estate mansion located in central Tokyo. He eventually left Japan due to fears of the excessively large level of support he had there and went to the States. In Japan, He met and befriended  Mariano Ponce , then a diplomat of the  First Philippine Republic . Sun also supported the cause for Philippine Independence and even supplied the Philippine army with guns. On 10 October 1911, a military  uprising at Wuchang  in which Sun had no direct involvement (at that moment Sun was still in exile and  Huang Xing  was in charge of the revolution), began a process that ended over two thousand years of imperial rule in China. When he learned of the successful rebellion against the  Qing  emperor from press reports, Sun immediately returned to China from the United States. Later, on 29 December 1911 a meeting of representatives from provinces in  Nanking  elected Sun as the provisional  President of the Republic of China  and set 1 January 1912 as the  first day  of the First Year of the Republic. This republic calendar system is still used in  Taiwan  today.   The official history of the  Kuomintang  (and for that matter, the  Communist Party of China ) emphasizes Sun's role as the first provisional President, but many historians now question the importance of Sun's role in the 1911 revolution and point out that he had no direct role in the Wuchang uprising and was in fact out of the country at the time. In this interpretation, his naming as the first provisional President was precisely because he was a respected but rather unimportant figure and therefore served as an ideal compromise candidate between the revolutionaries and the conservative  gentry .   However, Sun is credited for the funding of the revolutions and for keeping the spirit of revolution alive, even after a series of failed uprisings. Also, as mentioned, he successfully merged minor revolutionary groups to a single larger party, providing a better base for all those who shared the same ideals.   Sun is highly regarded as the National Father of modern China. His political philosophy, known as the  Three Principles of People , was proclaimed in August 1905. In his  Methods and Strategies of Establishing the Country  completed in 1919, he suggested using his Principles to establish ultimate  peace ,  freedom , and  equality  in the country. He devoted all efforts throughout his whole lifetime until his death for a strong and prosperous China and the well being of its people.     [ edit ]   Republic of China       Sun Yat-sen in  Guangzhou , 1924       After taking the oath of office, Sun Yat-sen sent  telegrams  to the leaders of all provinces, requesting them to elect and send new  senators  to establish the  National Assembly of the Republic of China . The Assembly then declared the provisional government organizational guidelines and the provisional law of the Republic as the basic law of the nation.   The provisional government was in a very weak position. The southern provinces of China had declared independence from the Qing dynasty, but most of the northern provinces had not. Moreover, the provisional government did not have military forces of its own, and its control over elements of the  New Army  that had mutinied was limited, and there were still significant forces which had not declared against the Qing.   The major issue before the provisional government was gaining the support of  Yuan Shikai , the man in charge of the  Beiyang Army , the military of northern China. After Sun promised Yuan the presidency of the new Republic, Yuan sided with the revolution and forced the  emperor  to abdicate. (Eventually, Yuan proclaimed himself emperor and afterwards opposition snowballed against Yuan's dictatorial methods, leading him to renounce the throne shortly before his death in 1916.) In 1913 Sun led an unsuccessful revolt against Yuan, and he was forced to seek asylum in Japan, where he reorganized the Kuomintang. He married  Soong Ching-ling , one of the  Soong sisters , in Japan on 25 October 1915, without divorcing his first wife Lu Muzhen due to opposition from the Chinese community. Lu pleaded with him to take Soong as a concubine but this was also unacceptable to Sun's  Christian ethics .     [ edit ]   Guangzhou militarist government   In the late 1910s, China was greatly divided by different military leaders without a proper central government. Sun saw the danger of this and returned to China in 1917 to advocate unification. He started a self-proclaimed military government in  Guangzhou  (Canton), Guangdong Province, southern China, in 1921, and was elected as president and  generalissimo .   In a February 1923 speech presented to the  Students' Union  in  Hong Kong University , he declared that it was the corruption of China and the peace, order and good government of Hong Kong that turned him into a revolutionary. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  This same year, he delivered a speech in which he proclaimed his  Three Principles of the People  as the foundation of the country and the  Five-Yuan Constitution  as the guideline for the political system and bureaucracy. Part of the speech was made into the  National Anthem of the Republic of China .   To develop the military power needed for the  Northern Expedition  against the militarists at  Beijing , he established the  Whampoa Military Academy  near Guangzhou, with  Chiang Kai-shek  as its  commandant  and with such party leaders as  Wang Ching-wei  and  Hu Han-min  as political instructors. The Academy was the most eminent military school of the Republic of China and trained graduates who fought in the  Second Sino-Japanese War  and on both sides of the  Chinese Civil War .          Sun Yat-sen (middle) and  Chiang Kai-shek  (on stage in uniform) at the founding of the  Whampoa Military Academy  in 1924.       However, as soon as he established his government in Guangzhou, Sun Yat-sen came into conflict with entrenched local power. Sun's militarist government was not based on the Provisional Constitution of 1912, which the anti-Beiyang forces vowed to defend in the  Constitutional Protection War . In addition, Sun was elected president by a parliament that did not meet  quorum  following its move from Beijing. Thus, many politicians and warlords alike challenged the legitimacy of Sun's militarist government. Sun's use of heavy taxes to fund the Northern Expedition to militarily unify China also came at odds with reformers such as  Chen Jiongming , who advocated establishing  Guangdong  as a model province before launching a costly military campaign. In sum, Sun's military government was opposed by the internationally-recognized  Beiyang government  in the north, Chen's Guangdong provincial government in the south, and other provincial powers that shifted alliance according to their own benefit.     [ edit ]   Path to Northern Expedition and death          Sun's portrait adorns  Republic of China 's  NT$ 100 bill.       He again became premier of the Kuomintang from 10 October 1919  12 March 1925. In the early 1920s Sun received help from the  Comintern  for his reorganization of the Kuomintang as a  Leninist   Democratic-Centrist  Party and negotiated the  First CCP-KMT United Front . In 1924, in order to hasten the conquest of China, he began a policy of active cooperation with the  Chinese Communists .   By this time, Sun was convinced that the only hope for a unified China lay in a military conquest from his base in the south, followed by a period of political tutelage that would culminate in the transition to  democracy . Sun then prepared for the later Northern Expedition with help from foreign powers until his death.   On 10 November 1924, Sun traveled north and delivered another speech to suggest gathering a conference for the Chinese people and the abolition of all unequal treaties with the Western powers. Two days later, he yet again traveled to Beijing to discuss the future of the country, despite his deteriorating health and the ongoing civil war of the  warlords . Although ill at the time, he was still head of the southern government. On 28 November 1924 Sun traveled to Japan and gave a remarkable  speech on Pan-Asianism  at  Kobe ,  Japan . He left Guangzhou to hold peace talks with the northern regional leaders on the unification of China. Sun died of  liver cancer  on 12 March 1925, at the age of 58 at the  Rockefeller Hospital in Beijing . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Legacy          Sun Yat-sen tribute in  Tiananmen Square , 2005.       One of Sun's major legacies was his political philosophy, the  Three Principles of the People  (sanmin zhuyi,  ;). These Principles included the principle of nationalism (minzu, ), democracy (minquan,  ) and the People's Livelihood (minsheng, ). The Principles retained a place in the rhetoric of both the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party with completely different interpretations. This difference in interpretation is due partly to the fact that Sun seemed to hold an ambiguous attitude to both capitalist and communist methods of development, as well as due to his untimely death, in 1925, before he had finished his now-famous lecture series on the Three Principles of the People. In addition, Sun is also one of the primary  saints  of the  Vietnamese   religion   Cao Dai .     [ edit ]   Power struggle   After Sun's death, a power struggle between his young  protg   Chiang Kai-shek  and his old revolutionary comrade  Wang Jingwei  split the KMT. At stake in this struggle was the right to lay claim to Sun's ambiguous legacy. In 1927 Chiang Kai-shek married  Soong May-ling , a sister of Sun's widow  Soong Ching-ling , and subsequently he could claim to be a brother-in-law of Sun. When the  Communists and the Kuomintang split  in 1927, marking the start of the  Chinese Civil War , each group claimed to be his true heirs, a conflict that continued through  World War II .   The official veneration of Sun's memory, especially in the Kuomintang, was a virtual  cult , which centered around his tomb in  Nanking . His widow,  Soong Ching-ling , sided with the Communists during the Chinese Civil War and served from 1949 to 1981 as Vice President (or Vice Chairwoman) of the  People's Republic of China  and as Honorary President shortly before her death in 1981.     [ edit ]   Father of the Nation   Sun Yat-sen remains unique among twentieth-century Chinese leaders for having a high reputation both in  mainland China  and in Taiwan. In Taiwan, he is seen as the Father of the  Republic of China , and is known by the  posthumous name   Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Chungshan  ( Chinese :  6k-qH , where the one-character space is a traditional homage symbol). His likeness is still almost always found in ceremonial locations such as in front of legislatures and classrooms of public schools, from elementary to senior high school, and he continues to appear in new coinage and currency.     [ edit ]   Forerunner of the Revolution           Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum  in  Nanjing       On the  mainland , Sun is also seen as a Chinese  nationalist  and proto-socialist, and is highly regarded as the  Forerunner of the Revolution  (i}HL). He is mentioned by name in the preamble to the  Constitution of the People's Republic of China . In most major Chinese cities one of the main streets is named ""Zhongshan"" ( -q ) to memorialize him, a name even more commonly found than other popular choices such as ""Renmin Lu"" (  ), or  The People's Road , and ""Jiefang Lu"" ( > ), or  Liberation Road . There are also numerous parks, schools, and geographical features named after him. The city of  Zhongshan  in  Guangdong , where Sun was originally from, is named after Sun, and there is a hall dedicated to his memory at the  Temple of Azure Clouds  in Beijing.   In recent years, the leadership of the  Communist Party of China  has increasingly invoked Sun, partly as a way of bolstering  Chinese nationalism  in light of  Chinese economic reform  and partly to increase connections with supporters of the  Kuomintang  on  Taiwan  which the PRC sees as allies against Taiwanese independence. Sun's tomb was one of the first stops made by the leaders of both the Kuomintang and the  People First Party  on their  trips to mainland China in 2005 . A massive portrait of Sun continues to appear in  Tiananmen Square  for  May Day  and the  National Day .     [ edit ]   Sun and the overseas Chinese   Sun's notability and popularity extends beyond the  Greater China  region, particularly to  Nanyang  where a large concentration of  overseas Chinese  reside in  Singapore  and  Malaysia . Sun recognised the contributions that the large number of overseas Chinese could make, beyond the sending of remittances to their ancestral homeland. He therefore made multiple visits to spread his revolutionary message to these communities around the world.   Sun made a total of eight visits to  Singapore  between 1900 and 1911. The first, on 7 September 1900, was to rescue  Miyazaki Toten , an ardent Japanese supporter and friend of Sun's, who was arrested there, an act which resulted in his own arrest and a ban from visiting the island for five years. Upon his next visit in June 1905, he met local Chinese merchants Teo Eng Hock, Tan Chor Nam and Lim Nee Soon in a meeting which was to mark the commencement of direct support from the Nanyang Chinese. Upon hearing their reports on overseas Chinese revolutionists organising themselves in Europe and Japan, he urged them to establish the Singapore chapter of the  Tongmenghui , which came officially into being on 6 April the following year upon his next visit.          Sun Yat-sen's original handwriting expressing his unchanging  love  to his wife  Soong Ching-ling .       The chapter was housed in a  villa  known as  Wan Qing Yuan  ( Zt ) and donated for the use of revolutionalists by Teo. In 1906, the chapter grew in membership to 400, and in 1908, when Sun was in Singapore to escape the Qing government in the wake of the failed  Zhennanguan Uprising , the chapter had become the regional headquarters for Tongmenghui branches in  Southeast Asia . Sun and his followers travelled from Singapore to  Malaya  and Indonesia to spread their revolutionary message, by which time the alliance already had over twenty branches with over 3,000 members around the world.   Sun's foresight in tapping the help and resources of the overseas Chinese population was to bear fruit on his subsequent revolutionary efforts. In one particular instance, his personal plea for financial aid at the  Penang Conference  held on 13 November 1910 in Malaya, helped launch a major drive for donations across the  Malay Peninsula , an effort which helped finance the  Second Guangzhou Uprising  (also commonly known as the  Yellow Flower Mound revolt ) in 1911.   The role that overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia played during the 1911 Revolution was so significant that Sun himself recognized ""Overseas Chinese as the Mother of the Revolution"".   Today, Sun's legacy is remembered in Nanyang at Wan Qing Yuan, which has since been preserved and renamed as the  Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall , and gazetted as a  national monument  of Singapore on 28 October 1994.   In  Penang , the Penang Philomatic Union which was founded by Sun in 1908, has embarked on a heritage project to turn its premises at 65 Macalister Road into  Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Museum.  The project is expected to complete in late 2006.   The old Chinatown in  Calcutta  (now known as  Kolkata ),  India  has a prominent street by the name of Sun Yat Sen Street.

(October 2008)         This is a  Chinese name ; the  family name  is   Zhuge  () .         Zhuge Ke          Traditional Chinese :          Simplified Chinese :                Transliterations             Zhuge Ke  (203  253), courtesy name  Yuanxun  (), was an officer for  Eastern Wu  during the  Three Kingdoms  era of  China . He was the son of the Wu minister,  Zhuge Jin , whose younger brother was the great  Shu Han  strategist,  Zhuge Liang . He succeeded  Lu Xun  after Lu's death. After the death of the founding emperor  Sun Quan , Zhuge Ke served as regent for his son  Sun Liang , but the regency proved to be militarily disastrous due to Zhuge Ke's overagressiveness against  Cao Wei . In 253, Zhuge Ke was killed, along with his family, in a coup d'tat.           Contents       1   Career during Sun Quan's reign   2   As regent to Sun Liang   3   Anecdotal stories or legends about Zhuge Ke   4   See also               [ edit ]   Career during Sun Quan's reign   After Eastern Wu's founding emperor Sun Quan created his son  Sun Deng  as crown prince in 221, he set up a staff for the crown prince consisting of the sons of the key officials or other well-known young members of the administration. The four most prominent ones were Zhuge Ke,  Zhang Zhao 's son  Zhang Xiu  (),  Gu Yong 's son  Gu Tan , and  Chen Wu 's son  Chen Biao . Sun Deng treated them as friends, not as subordinates, and they grew up together and served as Sun Deng's advisors. When Sun Deng had his secretary  Hu Zong  () write a commentary about his advisors in 229, Hu Zong wrote that Zhuge Ke was the most intelligent and skillful of his generation. While this was true, he also quickly developed a reputation for being reckless, a characteristic that both his father Zhuge Jin and his uncle Zhuge Liang repeatedly rebuked him about. On one occasion, Zhuge Jin observed, ""This child will either bring great honor to my household or destroy it.""   By 234, Zhuge Ke was serving as a commander of the capital guards, and he submitted a plan to Sun Quan to suppress the indigenous  Yue  people of the important Danyang Commandery (, roughly modern  Xuancheng ,  Anhui ), who had not submitted to Eastern Wu authorities and were pillaging the  Han people  -- a plan that most senior officials, including Zhuge Jin, considered reckless and costly. Zhuge Ke, however, insisted that his plan would be successful, so Sun Quan commissioned him as the governor of Danyang and gave him full powers to implement his plan. Once he arrived, he requested the four neighboring commanderies to seal their borders and did not combat the Yue; then, when the rice became ready for harvest, he had the rice harvested quickly and then gathered up, away from the pillaging Yue. The Yue were starved into submission, and as soon as they submitted, he treated them with kindness. By 237, Danyang was entirely under Eastern Wu authorities' control and became a productive commandery for manpower and supplies. Sun Quan was impressed and created Zhuge Ke a marquess.   In 243, Zhuge Ke planned a major attack on the important Cao Wei city of  Shouchun , and he put his army in an attack posture. However, when the prominent Cao Wei officer  Sima Yi  arrived and prepared to attack Zhuge Ke, rather than allowing Zhuge to face the much more experienced Sima Yi in battle, Sun Quan ordered that Zhuge Ke withdraw. Still, among the people, Zhuge Ke became renowned for being willing to stand against Sima Yi.  Lu Xun , however, became concerned about Zhuge Ke's recklessness and wrote him in rebuke. Knowing that he had to submit to the senior Lu Xun, Zhuge Ke wrote back and apologized. After Lu Xun's death in 245, Sun commissioned Zhuge Ke to take over Lu Xun's key post at Wuchang (in modern  Ezhou ,  Hubei ).   In 251, as Sun Quan neared death, he sought a regent for his young son and heir, Sun Liang. His personal assistant  Sun Jun  recommended Zhuge Ke, and it was also the sentiment of the people that Zhuge was the most capable. Sun Quan was concerned about Zhuge Ke's arrogance and overly high opinion of himself, but at Sun Jun's urging commissioned him to be regent, summoning him back from Wuchang. As Zhuge departed Wuchang, the senior general  L Dai , knowing Zhuge Ke's recklessness, told him, ""What you will be doing is difficult. Before you do anything, think ten times."" Zhuge, rather than showing his earlier submission to Lu Xun, responded irreverently to L Dai, ""When  Ji Wenzi  (, a student of  Confucius ) thought three times before acting, Confucius told him, 'Only think twice.' Now you, sir, told me to think ten times. Is it not that you are calling me stupid?"" L Dai was unable to respond, and the people at the time thought that L did speak inappropriately, but later historians pointed to this incident as a sign of Zhuge's ever growing arrogance and recklessness. Indeed, after Sun named him regent and ordered that all important matters be decided by Zhuge Ke first (except matters of life and death) and made all other officials bow to Zhuge Ke, Zhuge became even more arrogant.   After Sun Quan's death in 252, Sun Liang succeeded him, and Zhuge Ke served as regent, as Sun Quan willed.     [ edit ]   As regent to Sun Liang   Upon becoming regent, Zhuge Ke relaxed some of the strict laws that Sun Quan had put in place in his late reign and cut the tax rates. The people were happy, and wherever he went, there would be large crowds wanting to catch a glimpse of him.   Later in 252, Zhuge rebuilt the  Dongxing Dam  (, in modern  Chaohu ,  Anhui ), which Sun Quan had initially built in 230 but which was destroyed in 241, to create a reservoir near the  Chao Lake , with the dual purpose of using it as a defense against potential Cao Wei attacks and, with two castles built nearby, as forward attack mechanism for Eastern Wu ships. In response, Cao Wei's regent  Sima Shi  (Sima Yi's son) made a major three-pronged attack against Eastern Wu, with the main forces attacking Dongxing Dam. Zhuge and his general  Ding Feng  were able to catch Cao Wei forces unprepared by pretending to be unprepared themselves, and then inflicted a major loss on the Cao Wei forces, forcing their withdrawal.   Encouraged by his success at Dongxing, Zhuge Ke prepared for a major attack against Cao Wei -- citing, as his reason, that Sima Shi (then 45) was ""young and inexperienced."" He carried out a plan he had for a while -- to gather up nearly all service-eligible young men of Eastern Wu to make a major attack against Cao Wei -- despite opposition by a number of other officials. He further coordinated his attack with ally Shu Han's regent  Jiang Wei . However, his strategy turned out to be faulty -- as he was initially targeting Shouchun but, on his way, changed his mind and attacked  Hefei  instead, despite the fact that Hefei's defenses were strong and intended to withstand major Eastern Wu attacks. Zhuge Ke's forces became worn out by the long-term siege and suffered plagues -- which Zhuge Ke ignored. He eventually withdrew after Cao Wei reinforcements arrived, but instead of returning to the capital  Jianye  and apologize for his erroneous strategies, he remained from the capital for some time and never apologized to the people for the heavy losses suffered.   When Zhuge Ke eventually did return to Jianye, he further sternly tried to wipe out all dissent, punishing all those who disagreed with him. He further planned another attack against Cao Wei, disregarding the recent heavy losses the people had suffered and their resentment. Sun Jun decided that he had to kill Zhuge Ke. He told Sun Liang that Zhuge was planning treason, and he set up a trap at the imperial feast for Zhuge. (How much the young emperor knew of Sun Jun's plans and whether he concurred is unclear; traditional historians implied that Sun Liang knew and concurred, but he was just 10 years old at this point.) During the middle of the feast, assassins that Sun Jun had arranged for killed Zhuge, and Sun Jun's forces then wiped out the Zhuge clan.   After the death of Sun Jun and his successor, his cousin  Sun Lin , the emperor  Sun Xiu , in 258, reburied Zhuge with honors, but when someone suggested that a monument be built for Zhuge, Sun Xiu refused -- observing correctly that both the military losses and the reckless way in which he put his own life in danger showed that Zhuge Ke was unworthy of a monument.     [ edit ]   Anecdotal stories or legends about Zhuge Ke   An anecdotal story regarding Zhuge Ke's fame during his childhood or adolescence involved a banquet. Among top Eastern Wu officials, a running joke was that Zhuge Jin's face resembled that of a donkey. To tease Zhuge Ke, Sun Quan brought in a donkey; it bore a sign reading ""Zhuge Ziyu"" (Ziyu being Zhuge Jin's courtesy name). Sun Quan then turned to Zhuge Ke and told him to add any two characters that he wanted to the sign. Zhuge Ke added quickly ""The donkey of"" ( zhi l , ) and requested that the donkey be given to his father, and this quick wit impressed Sun Quan.   At another banquet, Sun Quan asked Zhuge Ke, ""Is your father superior, or is your uncle Zhuge Liang superior?"" Zhuge Ke quickly responded, ""My father is."" When asked why, Zhuge Ke responded, ""My father knows the right emperor to serve, while my uncle does not, and therefore my father is superior."" Sun Quan was impressed by the subtle flattery and told Zhuge Ke to offer wine to all the senior officials present (considered a high honor for the junior officials). When he came upon the venerable Zhang Zhao, Zhang refused, claiming that he was too old to drink. Zhuge convinced him to accept the wine, comparing him to the legendary prime minister of the  Zhou Dynasty ,  Jiang Ziya , which impressed Zhang Zhao and Sun Quan.   On yet another occasion, a Shu Han ambassador arrived with a gift of horses for Sun Quan. Sun Quan knew that Zhuge Ke was a good rider, and summoned him with intent to award him one of the horses. When Zhuge Ke arrived, he immediately knelt and thanked the bestowment. Sun Quan was surprised at how he knew what he was summoned for, and Zhuge Ke's response was, ""Shu Han only serves as your imperial majesty's stable, and it is certain that the ambassador has offered a tribute of horses."" This remark deprecated Shu Han and flattered Sun Quan, and Sun was again impressed.

Sun has had a significant impact on  Chinese  and  Asian history  and  culture , both as an author of the  Art of War  and as a legendary figure. During the 19th and 20th centuries, Sun's  The Art of War  grew in popularity and saw practical use in  Western society , and his work has continued to influence both Asian and Western culture and politics.   Historians have questioned whether or not Sun was an authentic historical figure. Traditional accounts place him in the  Spring and Autumn Period  of China (722481 BCE) as a heroic general of the  King of Wu  who lived c. 544496 BCE. Scholars accepting his historicity place his writing of  The Art of War  in the  Warring States Period  (403221 BCE), based on the descriptions of warfare in the text. Traditional accounts state that his descendant,  Sun Bin , also wrote a master treatise on military tactics.

According to traditional sources, such as the 2nd century BCE biography written by  Sima Qian , Sun was born [ 1 ]  in c. 400 BCE [ 2 ]  in  Qi  during the  Spring and Autumn Period  of China (722481 BCE) and became a heroic general for the king of  Wu ,  Hel . His victories then inspired him to write  The Art of War . Historians place the writing of  The Art of War  in the  Warring States Period  (403221 BCE), based on its description of warfare. The period was a time of constant war between seven nations ( Zhao , Qi,  Qin ,  Chu ,  Han ,  Wei  and  Yan ) seeking to control all of China. [ 1 ]  He is thought to have died in c. 320 BCE. [ 2 ]   The king of Wu tested Sun's skills by commanding him to train a  harem  of 360 concubines into soldiers. Sun divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun then ordered the execution of the king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers. Sun also said that once a general was appointed, it was their duty to carry out their mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterward, both companies performed their maneuvers flawlessly. Sima's biography claims that Sun later proved on the battlefield that his theories were effective, that he had a successful military career, and that he wrote  The Art of War  based on his tested expertise. His descendant,  Sun Bin , also became a famous scholar of the military arts. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   The Art of War        Part of  a series  on   Taoism                   Fundamentals         Dao (Tao)     De   Wuji     Taiji   Yin-Yang     Wu xing   Qi     Neidan   Wu wei         Texts         Daodejing (Tao Te Ching)   Zhuangzi     Liezi   Daozang         Deities         Three Pure Ones   Guan Shengdi   Eight Immortals   Yellow Emperor     Xiwangmu   Jade Emperor     Chang'e   Other deities         People         Laozi     Zhuangzi     Sunzi   Zhang Daoling     Zhang Jiao   Ge Hong     Chen Tuan   Wang Chongyang         Schools         Five Pecks of Rice   Celestial Masters   Shangqing     Lingbao   Quanzhen     Zhengyi   Xuanxue         Sacred sites         Grotto-heavens             v      d      e             Main article:  The Art of War              A bamboo version of  The Art of War       The Art of War  is attributed to Sun, and it was originally called the  Sun Tzu Ping Fa  ( Pinyin :  Sunzi Bingfa ), or simply the  Sun Tzu . It presents a  philosophy of war  for managing conflicts and winning battles. Contrary to popular belief, it contains not only the writings of the original author, but also commentary and clarifications from later military philosophers, such as Li Quan and  Du Mu . It is accepted as a masterpiece on strategy and often referenced by generals and theorists throughout history. [ 3 ]  Of the texts written before the  unification of China  in the 2nd century BCE, six major works survived, including  The Art of War . During the  Song Dynasty  in the early 1st millenium CE, the six works were combined with a  Tang Dynasty  text into a collection called the  Seven Military Classics . As a central part of that compilation,  The Art of War  formed the foundations of orthodox military theory in China. Illustrating this point, the book required reading to pass the tests needed for imperial appointment to military positions. [ 4 ]   In the book, Sun uses language that may be unusual in a Western text on warfare and strategy. For example, the 11th chapter states that a leader must be ""serene and inscrutable"" and capable of comprehending ""unfathomable plans"". The text contains similar remarks that have confused Western readers. The meaning of such statements are clearer when interpreted in the context of  Taoist  thought and practice. Sun viewed the ideal general as an  enlightened  Taoist master, [ 5 ]  which has led to  The Art of War  being considered a prime example of Taoist strategy. [ 6 ]   The Art of War  is distinguished from similar Western works, such as  Prussian  general  Carl von Clausewitz 's  On War , by this spiritual dimension. Awareness of the Taoist viewpoint in  The Art of War  is essential to understanding its intended meaning. [ 5 ]  The book is not only popular among military theorists, but it has also become increasingly popular among political leaders and those in  business management . Despite its title,  The Art of War  addresses strategy in a broad fashion, touching upon  public administration  and planning. The text outlines theories of battle but also advocates  diplomacy  and cultivating relationships with other nations as essential to the health of a state. [ 3 ]   In the early 1970s, scholars uncovered a collection of ancient texts written on unusually well-preserved  bamboo slips . Among them were  The Art of War  and Sun Bin's  Military Methods . Although  Han Dynasty  bibliographies noted the latter publication as extant and written by a descendant of Sun, it has since been lost. The finding of Sun Bin's work was considered to be extremely important, because of Sun Bin's relationship to Sun, and the work's illustration of military thought in late Chinese antiquity. The discovery as a whole expanded the total known Chinese military works by hundreds. However, Sun Bin's treatise is the only known additional text surviving from the ancient period or bearing a close association with Sun Tzu. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Historicity   Scholars have expressed doubt in Sun's historicity and the traditional dating of  The Art of War . The skepticism is fueled by factors that include historical inaccuracies and anachronisms in the text, as well as the unlikelihood of the execution of the king's favorite concubines. Increasing skepticism, which sometimes cause scholars to completely deny the existence of a historical figure named Sun Wu (Sun Tzu), has lead to acrimonious debate between skeptics and traditionalists, especially in China. Attribution of  The Art of War ' s authorship varies among scholars, and have included people and movements including Sun; Chu scholar  Wu Zixu ; an unknown author; a school of thought in Qi or Wu; and Sun Bin. [ 8 ]   Traditionalists attribute the authorship of  The Art of War  to the historical figure Sun Wu, who is chronicled in the  Records of the Grand Historian  and the  Spring and Autumn Annals . He was reputedly active in the early 6th century BCE, beginning c. 512 BCE. The appearance of features from  The Art of War  in other historical texts is considered to be proof of his historicity and authorship. Certain strategic concepts, such as terrain classification, are attributed to Sun Tzu. Their use in other works, such as by the compilers of  The Methods of the Sima , is considered proof of Sun Tzu's historical priority. [ 9 ]   Scholars that identify issues with the traditionalist view point to anachronisms in  The Art of War  that include terms, technology, philosophical ideas, events, and military techniques. There is a disparity between the large scale wars and sophisticated techniques detailed in the text, and the more primitive small scale battles that predominated the 6th century BCE. There is also a lack of early contemporary evidence supporting the centuries-later accounts of Sun. For example, there is no corroborating support for his role in the wars between Wu and  Yue  in the  Zuo Zhuan , which is considered the authoritative record of the period. [ 9 ]  Regardless of Sun's historicity and the actual authorship of  The Art of War , the figure of Sun and his traditionally attributed work have been influential. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Legacy   Sun's  The Art of War  has influenced many notable figures. Traditional histories recount that the first emperor of a unified China,  Qin Shi Huang , considered the book invaluable in ending the Age of Warring States. Japan was introduced to  The Art of War  c. 760 CE, and the book quickly became popular among Japan's generals. The publication also significantly influenced the unification of Japan. Mastery of its teachings was considered a mark of respect among the  samurai , and its teachings were both exhorted and exemplified by influential samurai such as  Oda Nobunaga ,  Toyotomi Hideyoshi , and  Tokugawa Ieyasu . [ 11 ]  Historians popularly recount how French emperor  Napoleon  studied Sun's military writings and used them to successfully wage war against the rest of Europe. The emperor's disregard for central principles such as attentiveness to temporal conditions is largely credited for his eventual  defeat in Russia .  Admiral of the Fleet   Tg Heihachir , who led Japan's forces to victory against Russia in the  Russo-Japanese War , was a famous disciple of  The Art of War ' s teachings. [ 12 ]   Communist Chinese leader  Mao Zedong  partially credited his defeat of  Chiang Kai-shek  and the  Kuomintang  in 1949 to  The Art of War . The work strongly influenced Mao's writings about  guerrilla warfare , which further influenced communist insurgencies around the world. During the  Gulf War  in the 1990s, General  Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.  practiced Sun's principles of deception, speed, and attacking the enemy's weakness. [ 11 ]  Mark McNeilly writes in  Sun Tzu and the Art of Modern Warfare  that a modern interpretation of Sun and his importance throughout Chinese history is critical in understanding China's push to becoming a superpower in the 21st century. Modern Chinese scholars explicitly rely on historical strategic lessons and  The Art of War  in developing their theories, seeing a direct relationship between their modern struggles and those of China in Sun's time. There is a great perceived value in Sun's teachings and other traditional Chinese writers, which are used regularly in developing the strategies of the Chinese state and its leaders.

clueweb09-enwp01-18-00624	"                     List of Chinese inventions          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 A four-horse chariot with a parasol from the  Terracotta Army  of  Qin Shi Huang 's tomb (interred by 210 BCE); the Chinese were the first to invent the  collapsible  umbrella.       China  has been the source of some of the world's most significant  inventions , including the  Four Great Inventions of ancient China :  paper , the  compass ,  gunpowder , and  printing  (both  woodblock  and  movable type ). The list below contains these and other inventions which first appeared in China. It does not include foreign-born technologies which the Chinese cultural realm acquired through contact, such as the  windmill  from the  Islamic Middle East  or the  telescope  from  Early modern Europe . It also does not include technologies which were originally invented elsewhere but were later invented separately by the Chinese in their own right, such as the  chain pump  and  odometer . Since there is no evidence that the Chinese were the first to invent writing or the calendar, Chinese inventions such as  Chinese writing  and the  Chinese calendar  do not need to be mentioned or described. The same may be applied to articles like  Chinese opera ,  Chinese mathematics , and  Chinese architecture . This is also not a  list of Chinese discoveries  of natural phenomena which can be found in the human body, other organisms, the environment of the world, and immediate solar system.   The Chinese invented original technologies involving mechanics, hydraulics, and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, nautics, and warfare. By the  Warring States Period  (403221 BCE), the Chinese had advanced metallurgic technology, including the  blast furnace  and  cupola furnace , while the  finery forge  and  puddling process  were known by the  Han Dynasty  (202 BCE220 CE). The rise of a sophisticated economic system in China gave birth to inventions such as the use of  paper money  during the  Song Dynasty  (9601279). The invention of gunpowder by at least the 10th century led to an array of unique inventions such as the  fire lance ,  land mine ,  naval mine ,  hand cannon ,  exploding cannonballs ,  multistage rocket , and  rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads . With the navigational aid of the 11th-century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st-century sternpost  rudder , premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as  East Africa  and  Egypt . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  In regards to water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the  escapement  mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting  chain drive  in the 11th century. They also created large mechanical  puppet  theaters driven by  waterwheels  and  carriage wheels  and wine-serving  automatons  driven by  paddle wheel boats .   The contemporaneous  Peiligang  and  Pengtoushan cultures  represent the oldest  Neolithic cultures of China  and were formed sometime around 7000 BC. [ 4 ]  Some of the first inventions of Neolithic, pre-historic China include semilunar and rectangular stone knives, stone  hoes  and  spades , the cultivation of  millet ,  rice  and the  soybean , the refinement of  sericulture , the building of  rammed earth  structures with  lime -plastered house floors, the creation of the  potter's wheel , the  creation of pottery  with cord-mat-basket designs, the creation of pottery tripods and pottery steamers, and the development of ceremonial vessels and  scapulimancy  for purposes of  divination . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  Francesca Bray argues that the domestication of the  ox  and  buffalo  during the  Longshan culture  (c. 3000c. 2000 BC) period, the absence of Longshan-era  irrigation  or high-yield crops, full evidence of Longshan cultivation of dry-land cereal crops which gave high yields ""only when the soil was carefully cultivated,"" suggest that the  plow  was known at least by the Longshan culture period and explains the high agricultural production yields which allowed the rise of Chinese civilization during the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC). [ 7 ]  With later inventions such as the  multiple-tube seed drill  and  heavy moldboard iron plow , China's agricultural output could sustain a much larger population.       Contents:       A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M   N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   W   X   Y   Z   Four Great Inventions     Pre-Shang     Shang and later     See also     References             [ edit ]   Four Great Inventions   The following is a list of the  Four Great Inventions of ancient China as designated by the late  Joseph Needham  (19001995)in the chronological order that they were established in China.     [ edit ]   Paper          Fragments of  hemp  wrapping paper dated to the reign of  Emperor Wu of Han  (14187 BC)              The  Diamond Sutra , the oldest printed book, published in AD 868 during the  Tang Dynasty  (618907)              An illustration published in  Wang Zhen's  (fl. 12901333) book of AD 1313 showing  movable type  characters arranged by rhyme scheme in round table compartments       Although it is recorded that the  Han Dynasty  (202 BCAD 220) court eunuch  Cai Lun  (c. 50AD 121) invented the  papermaking  process and established the use of new raw materials used in making  paper , ancient padding and wrapping paper artifacts dating to the 2nd century BC have been found in China, the oldest example of paper  being a map  from Fangmatan,  Tianshui ; [ 8 ]  by the 3rd century, paper as a writing medium  was in widespread use , replacing traditional but more expensive writing mediums such as strips of  bamboo  rolled into threaded scrolls, scrolls and strips of  silk , wet  clay tablets  hardened later in a furnace, and wooden tablets. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  The earliest known piece of paper with writing on it was discovered in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei,  Alxa League , where Han Dynasty troops had deserted their position in AD 110 following a  Xiongnu  attack. [ 14 ]  In the papermaking process established by Cai in 105, a boiled mixture of  mulberry tree  bark, hemp, old linens, and fish nets created a pulp that was pounded into paste and stirred with water; a wooden frame sieve with a mat of sewn reeds was then dunked into the mixture, which was then shaken and then dried into sheets of paper that were bleached under the exposure of sunlight; K.S. Tom says this process was gradually improved through leaching, polishing and glazing to produce a smooth, strong paper. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Printing   Woodblock printing : The earliest specimen of woodblock printing discovered is a single-sheet  dharani  sutra in  Sanskrit  that was printed on hemp paper between 650 and 670 AD; it was unearthed in 1974 from a Tang tomb near  Xi'an . [ 15 ]  A  Korean  miniature  dharani  Buddhist  sutra  discovered in 1966, bearing  extinct Chinese writing characters  used only during the reign of China's only self-ruling empress,  Wu Zetian  (r. 690705), is dated no earlier than 704 and preserved in a  Silla Korean  temple  stupa  built in 751. [ 16 ]  However, the earliest known book printed at regular size is the  Diamond Sutra  made during the  Tang Dynasty  (618907), a 5.18 m (17 ft) long scroll which bears the date 868 AD, or the ""fifteenth day of the fourth moon of the ninth year"" of  Emperor Yizong's  (859873) Xiantong   reign period . [ 17 ]  Joseph Needham and Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin write that the cutting and printing techniques used for the  delicate calligraphy  of the  Diamond Sutra  book are much more advanced and refined than the miniature  dharani  sutra printed earlier. [ 17 ]  The two oldest printed  Chinese calendars  are dated 877 and 882; they were found at the Buddhist pilgrimage site of  Dunhuang ; Patricia Ebrey writes that it is no surprise that some of the earliest printed items were calendars, since the Chinese found it necessary to calculate and mark which days were auspicious and which were not. [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Movable type : The polymath scientist and official  Shen Kuo  (10311095) of the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) was the first to describe the process of movable type printing in his  Dream Pool Essays  of 1088, attributing this innovation to a little-known artisan named  Bi Sheng  (9901051). [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  With the use of fired clay characters, Shen described Bi's technical process of making the type, type-setting, printing, and breaking up the type for further use. [ 23 ] [ 22 ]  Bi had experimented with wooden type characters, but their use was not perfected until 1297 to 1298 with the model of the official  Wang Zhen  (fl. 12901333) of the  Yuan Dynasty  (12711368), who also arranged written characters by rhyme scheme on the surface of round table compartments. [ 24 ] [ 20 ]  It was not until 1490 with the printed works of  Hua Sui  (14391513) of the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) that the Chinese perfected metal movable type characters, namely  bronze . [ 25 ] [ 26 ]  The  Qing Dynasty  (16441912) scholar Xu Zhiding of  Tai'an ,  Shandong  developed  vitreous enamel  movable type printing in 1718. [ 27 ]   Effects on bookbinding : The advent of printing in the 9th century revolutionized bookbinding, as late Tang Dynasty paper books evolved from rolled scrolls of paper into folded leaves like a  pamphlet , which developed further in the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) into 'butterfly' bindings with leaves of paper folded down the center like a common book, then during the  Yuan Dynasty  (12711368) wrapped back bindings had two edges of the leaves attached to the spine and secured with a stiff paper cover on the back, and during the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) books finally had thread-stitched bindings in the back. [ 28 ]  It was not until the early 20th century that traditional Chinese thread-stitched bookbinding was replaced by  Western-style  bookbinding, a parallel to the replacement of traditional Chinese print methods with the modern  printing press , in the tradition of  Johannes Gutenberg  (c. 14001468). [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Gunpowder          The earliest artistic depiction of a  fire lance  gunpowder weapon, a painting at  Dunhuang , dated  Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period  (907960 AD)       Although evidence of  gunpowder 's first use in China comes from the  Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period  (907960), [ 30 ]  the earliest known recorded recipes for gunpowder were written by Zeng Gongliang, Ding Du, and Yang Weide in the  Wujing Zongyao  military manuscript compiled in 1044 during the  Song Dynasty  (9601279); the gunpowder formulas described were used in  incendiary bombs  lobbed from  catapults , thrown down from  defensive walls , or lowered down the wall by use of iron chains operated by a swape lever. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Bombs launched from  trebuchet  catapults mounted on  forecastles  of naval ships ensured the victory of Song over  Jin forces  at the  Battle of Caishi  in 1161, while the Mongol  Yuan Dynasty  (12711368)  used gunpowder bombs  during their  failed invasion of Japan  in 1274 and 1281. [ 32 ]  During the 13th and 14th centuries, gunpowder formulas became more potent (with  nitrate  levels of up to 91%) and gunpowder weaponry more advanced and deadly, as evidenced in the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) military manuscript  Huolongjing  compiled by  Jiao Yu  (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and  Liu Ji  (13111375), completed sometime before the latter's death with a preface added by the former in a 1412  Nanyang  publication of the work. [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   Compass          A model in  Kaifeng  of a Chinese ladle-and-bowl type  compass  used for  geomancy  in the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD); the historical authenticity of the model has been questioned by  Li Shu-hua  (1954). [ 35 ]       In  San Lorenzo Tenochtitln ,  Veracruz ,  Mexico , an ancient  hematite  artifact from the  Olmec  era dating roughly 1000 BC indicates the possible use of the  lodestone  compass in  Central America  long before it was described in China, yet the Olmecs did not have  iron  which the Chinese would discover could be magnetized by contact with lodestone. [ 36 ]  Descriptions of lodestone attracting iron were made in the  Guanzi ,  Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals  and  Huainanzi . [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ]  The Chinese by the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) began using north-south oriented lodestone ladle-and-bowl shaped  compasses  for  divination  and  geomancy  and not yet for  navigation . [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ]  The  Lunheng , written by  Wang Chong  (27c. 100 AD) stated in chapter 52: ""This instrument resembles a spoon, and when it is placed on a plate on the ground, the handle points to the south"". [ 43 ] [ 44 ]  There is, however, another two references under chapter 47 of the same text to the attractive power of a magnet according to Needham (1986), [ 45 ]  but Li Shu-hua (1954) considers it to be lodestone, and states that there is no explicit mention of a magnet in  Lunheng . [ 35 ]   Shen Kuo  (10311095) of the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) was the first to accurately describe both  magnetic declination  (in discerning  true north ) and the magnetic needle compass in his  Dream Pool Essays  of 1088, while the author  Zhu Yu  (fl. 12th century) was the first to mention use of the compass specifically for navigation at sea in his book published in 1119. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 41 ] [ 21 ] [ 50 ]  Even before this, however, the  Wujing Zongyao  military manuscript compiled by 1044 described a thermoremanence compass of heated iron or  steel  shaped as a fish and placed in a bowl of water which produced a weak magnetic force via remanence and induction; the  Wujing Zongyao  recorded that it was used as a pathfinder along with the mechanical  South Pointing Chariot . [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ]     [ edit ]   Pre-Shang   Inventions which originated in  what is now China during the Neolithic age  and pre-historic  Bronze age  are listed in alphabetical order below.          A  bronze  ritual  bell ,  Zhou Dynasty , 10th to 9th century BC         Bell : Clapper-bells made of pottery have been found in several archaeological sites; 1 in a  Yangshao  site at Dahecun,  Henan ; 1 in a  Daxi  site at Yijiashan,  Hubei ; 7 in the  Majiayao  sites in  Gansu ; 2 in the  Longshan  sites at Baiying and Wadian, Henan; 1 in a  Shijiahe  site at Tianmen, Hubei; 2 in a  Qijia  site at Dahezhuang, Gansu. [ 54 ]  The earliest metal bells, with one found in the  Taosi  site, and four in the  Erlitou  site, dated to about 2000 BC, may have been derived from the earlier pottery prototype. [ 55 ]  Early bells not only have an important role in generating metal sound, but arguably played a prominent cultural role. With the emergence of other kinds of bells during the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC), they were relegated to subservient functions; at Shang and  Zhou  sites, they are also found as part of the horse-and-chariot gear and as collar-bells of dogs. [ 56 ]   Coffin, rectangular wooden : The earliest evidence of wooden coffin remains, dating from the 5000 BC are found in the Tomb 4 at Beishouling,  Shaanxi . Clear evidence of wooden coffin in forms of rectangular shape are found in Tomb 152 in an early  Banpo  site. The Banpo coffin belongs to a four years old girl, measuring 1.4 m (4.5 ft) by 0.55 m (1.8 ft) and 39 cm thick. By 3000 BC, as much as 10 wooden coffins are found in the late phase of  Dawenkou culture  (41002600 BC) site at Chengzi,  Shandong . [ 57 ] [ 58 ]  The thickness of a wooden coffin composing by more than one timber frame also emphasized the level of  nobility , as mentioned in the  Classic of Rites , [ 59 ]   Xunzi [ 60 ]  and  Zhuangzi , [ 61 ]  and have been found at several Neolithic sites; double coffin, consisting an outer and inner coffins, with the earliest finds in the  Liangzhu culture  (34002250 BC) site at Puanqiao, Zhejiang; triple coffin, consisting of two outer and one inner coffins, are found in the  Longshan culture  (30002000 BC) sites at Xizhufeng and Yinjiacheng in Shandong. [ 62 ]  The double coffin remained used during the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC), such as the lacquered double coffin of  Marquis Yi of Zeng , [ 63 ]  and have also found in an archaeologial site of  Xiongnu 's aristocracy in  Inner Mongolia . [ 64 ]            A bronze  dagger-axe  from the  State of Han ,  Warring States Period  (403221 BC); this type of weapon has existed in China since the Neolithic period         Dagger-axe : The dagger-axe or  ge  was developed from agricultural stone implement during the Neothilic, dagger-axe made of stone are found in the  Longshan culture  (30002000 BC) site at Miaodian,  Henan . It also appeared as ceremonial and symbolic jade weapon at around the same time, two being dated from about 2500 BC, are found at the Lingjiatan site in  Anhui . [ 65 ]  The first bronze  ge  appeared at the early Bronze Age  Erlitou  site, [ 65 ]  where two were being found among the over 200 bronze artifacts (as of 2002) at the site, [ 66 ]  three jade  ge  were also discovered from the same site. [ 67 ]  Total of 72 bronze  ge  in Tomb 1004 at Houjiazhuang,  Anyang , [ 68 ]  39 jade  ge  in  tomb of Fu Hao  and over 50 jade  ge  at  Jinsha  site were found alone. [ 65 ]  It was the basic weapon of  Shang  (c. 16001050 BC) and  Zhou  (c. 1050 256 BC)  infantry , although it was sometimes used by the ""striker"" of  charioteer  crews. It consisted of a long wooden shaft with a bronze knife blade attached at a right angle to the end. The weapon could be swung down or inward in order to hook or slash, respectively, at an enemy. [ 69 ]  By the early  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD), military use of the bronze  ge  had become very limited (and mostly ceremonial); they were slowly phased out during the Han Dynasty by iron  spears  and iron  ji  halberds . [ 70 ]   Drum, alligator hide : Drums (made from clay) have been found over a broad area at the Neolithic sites from modern  Shandong  in the east to  Qinghai  in the west, dating to a period of 55002350 BC. In literary records, drums manifested shamanistic characteristics and were often used in ritual ceremonies. [ 71 ]  Drums covered with alligator skin for ceremonial use are mentioned in the  Shijing . [ 72 ] [ 73 ]  During the archaic period,  alligators  probably lived along the east coast of China, including southern  Shandong . The earliest alligator drums, comprising a wooden frame covered with alligator skin are found in the archaeological sites at  Dawenkou  (4100 BC2600 BC), as well as several sites of  Longshan  (3000 BC2000 BC) in Shandong and  Taosi  (2300 BC1900 BC) in southern  Shanxi . [ 74 ]            Chinese  rice wine  containers              A  Chinese jade  carving of a deer ornament from the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC)              A red  lacquerware  food tray with gold foil engraving, 12th to early 13th century,  Song Dynasty         Fermented beverage : Archaeologists have discovered residue of a fermented beverage that was 9,000-years old in pottery jars from the Neolithic site of  Jiahu ,  Henan . [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]  Chemical tests (including gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, infrared spectrometry, and stable isotope analysis) have revealed a fermented beverage of hawthorn fruit and wild grape, beeswax associated with honey, and rice. Herbal wine and a filtered rice or millet beverage was found 5000 years later in sealed Shang and Western Zhou bronze containers and has been identified as containing specialized  rice  or  millet , flavored with herbs, flowers, and possibly tree resins. [ 79 ] [ 78 ]  It was found that the chemical composition of the samples is similar to those in modern rice,  rice wine ,  grape wine , beehive wax, tannins, several herbal medicines and hawthorn. [ 80 ]   Fork : The fork had been used in China long before the  chopstick ; a bone fork has been discovered by archaeologists at a burial site of the early Bronze Age  Qijia culture  (24001900 BC), and forks have been found in tombs of the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC) and subsequent Chinese dynasties. [ 81 ]   Jade ritual object : Jade artifacts have been found in large quantities dating throughout the entire Neolithic period. The earliest development of jade use comes from the  Xinglongwa culture  (62005400 BC) at the  Liao River  region; jade carving reached to its height by the late  Hongshan culture  (35003000 BC), as shown in the  Niuheliang  site; in the lower  Yangzi River , jade objects first occurred in the  Majiabang  and Songze cultures (50003200 BC), and became prevalent in the  Liangzhu culture  (32002000 BC); in the middle Yangzi River, jades appeared in the middle  Daxi  and  Qujialing cultures  (40002600 BC), and flourished during the  Shijiahe culture  (26002000 BC); in the lower  Yellow River , jade objects are mainly dated to the  Dawenkou  and  Longshan cultures  (43002000 BC), [ 82 ]  although they have been found earlier in the  Houli culture  (65005500 BC). [ 83 ]  Jade plaques with the design of the  eight trigrams , dating from about 2500 BC, have also been found at Lingjiatan,  Anhui . [ 84 ]  Jade in distinctive shapes known later as  bi ,  cong ,  gui ,  zhang ,  huang , and  hu  or the six ritual jades are mentioned in the  Rites of Zhou ; [ 85 ]  the earliest  bi  and  huang  were produced in the Hongshan culture at Niuheliang and Dongshanzui sites; the  cong  appear in large numbers in the Liangzhu culture at Fanshan and Yaoshan sites; the  gui  appear in large numbers in the Longshan culture, examples are found in the Dachengshan site; the  zhang  and  hu  appeared relatively late, with one each found at the  Shang Dynasty  sites in  Erligang  and  Yinxu . [ 86 ]   Lacquer : Lacquer was used in China since the Neolithic period and came from a substance extracted from the  lac tree  found in China. [ 87 ]  A red wooden bowl, which is believed to be the earliest known lacquer container, [ 88 ]  was unearthed at a  Hemudu  (c. 5000 BCc. 4500 BC) site. [ 89 ]  Michael Loewe says coffins at many early Bronze Age sites seem to have been lacquered, and articles of lacquered wood may also have been common, but the earliest well-preserved examples of lacquer come from  Eastern Zhou Dynasty  (771256 BC) sites. [ 90 ]  However, Wang Zhongshu disagrees, stating that the oldest well-preserved lacquerware items come from a  Xiajiadian  (c. 2000c. 1600 BC) site in  Liaoning  excavated in 1977, the items being red lacquered vessels in the shape of  Shang Dynasty bronze gu vessels . [ 89 ]  Wang states that many lacquerware items from the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC), such as fragments of boxes and basins, were found, and had black designs such as the  Chinese dragon  and  taotie  over a red background. [ 89 ]  Queen  Fu Hao  (died c. 1200 BC)  was buried  in a lacquered wooden coffin. [ 91 ]  There were three imperial workshops during the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) established solely for the purpose of crafting  lacquerwares ; fortunately for the historian, Han lacquerware items were inscribed with the location of the workshop where they were produced and the date they were made, such as a lacquerware beaker found in the  Han colony  in northwestern  Korea  with the inscription stating it was made in a workshop near  Chengdu ,  Sichuan  and dated precisely to 55 AD. [ 92 ]             Lamian  noodles, similar to the 4,000-year-old  noodles  made from  millet  found at  Lajia              A pottery  gui  ( pitcher ) vessel from the late  Longshan culture  at  Shandong , c. 2500c. 2000 BC              An  oracle bone  shard from the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC) with writing (in  oracle bone script ) inquiring the divine on whether or not it will rain that day               Rice  terrace farming in Longji,  Guangxi , China         Millet, cultivation of : The discovery in northern China of domesticated varieties of  broomcorn  and  foxtail millet  from 8500 BC, or earlier, suggests that millet cultivation might have predated that of rice in parts of Asia. [ 93 ]  Clear evidence of millet began to cultivate by 6500 BC at sites of  Cishan ,  Peiligang , and  Jiahu . [ 94 ]  Archaeological remains from Cishan sum up to over 300 storeage pits, 80 with millet remains, with a total millet storage capacity estimated for the site of about 100,000 kg of grain. [ 95 ]  By 4000 BC, most  Yangshao  areas were using an intensive form of foxtail millet cultivation, complete with storage pits and finely prepared tools for digging and harvesting the crop. The success of the early Chinese millet farmers is still reflected today in the  DNA  of many east Asian populations, such studies have shown that the ancestors of those farmers probably arrived in the area between 30,000 and 20,000 BP, and their bacterial haplotypes are still found in today populations throughout eastern Asia. [ 96 ]   Noodle : In 2005, an archaeological excavation at the  Lajia  site of the  Qijia culture  (24001900 BC) revealed 4,000-year-old noodles made of  millet  (instead of traditional wheat flour) preserved by an upturned earthenware bowl that had created a vacuum between it and the sediment it was found on; the noodles resemble the traditional  lamian  noodle of China, which is made by ""repeatedly pulling and stretching the dough by hand,"" according to a BBC News report on the find. [ 97 ]   Oar, rowing : Rowing oars have been used since the  early Neothilic period ; a canoe-shaped pottery and six wooden oars dating from the 6000 BC have been discovered in a  Hemudu culture  site at  Yuyao ,  Zhejiang . [ 98 ] [ 99 ]  In 1999, an oar measuring 63.4 cm (2 ft) in length, dating from 4000 BC, has also been unearthed at  Ishikawa Prefecture ,  Japan . [ 100 ]   Pottery, tripod : Tripod pottery was a characteristic vessels of northern China from the Neolithic Peiligang culture through the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC). [ 101 ]  Tripod pottery bowls and pots had been unearthed from several sites belonging to the  Peiligang culture  (70005000 BC), including  type site ,  Jiahu , Shuiquan, Shigu and Beigang. [ 102 ] [ 103 ]  Tripods were known as cooking vessels, such as the hollow-legged  li  and solid-legged  ding , and pouring pitcher, such as  gui , they have three properly constructed and non-stubby legs stand on ground. Outside mainland China, tripod pottery associated with Neolithic cultures has been found only in  Taiwan  and  mainland Southeast Asia . The discoveries of tripods at Ban Kao site, brought question about the relationships of the Southeast Asian tripod pottery with other tripod pottery cultures of mainland China. [ 104 ] [ 105 ]  Bird-shaped tripod pottery, such as one found at  Hua County ,  Shaanxi , [ 106 ]  and the  gui  of the middle and late  Dawenkou culture  (35002600 BC) may also had associated with the mythologial  three-legged bird  or golden crow. [ 107 ]  The earliest depiction of a three-legged bird is found on the pottery of the  Miaodigou culture  (40003000 BC) in  Henan , [ 108 ]  they are also mentioned in the  Huainanzi  and  Records of the Grand Historian . [ 109 ]   Plastromancy : The earliest use of turtle shells comes from the archaeological site in  Jiahu  site. The shells, containing small pebbles of various size, color, and quantity, were drilled with small holes, suggesting that each pair of them was tied together originally. Similar finds have also been found in the  Dawenkou  burial sites of about 40003000 BC, as well as in Henan,  Sichuan ,  Jiangsu  and  Shaanxi . [ 110 ]  The turtle-shell shakers for the most part are made of the shell of land turtles, [ 111 ]  identified as  Cuora flavomarginata . [ 112 ]  These rattles have been unearthed in quantity, with 70 being found in the Jiahu site, and another 52 being found in the Dawenkou culture sites at Dadunzi, Jiangsu, and  type site , Liulin and Wangyin in  Shandong . [ 54 ]  Archaeologists believe that these shells were used either as rattles in ceremonial dances, shamantic healing tools or ritual paraphernalia for divinational purposes. [ 113 ]   Plowshare, triangular-shaped : Triangular-shaped stone plowshares are found at the sites of  Majiabang culture  dated to 3500 BC around  Lake Taihu . Plowshares have also been discovered at the nearby  Liangzhu  and Maqiao sites roughly dated to the same period. David R. Harris says this indicates that more intensive cultivation in fixed, probably bunded, fields had developed by this time. According to Mu Yongkang and Song Zhaolins classification and methods of use, the triangular plow assumed many kinds and were the departure from the Hemudu and Luojiajiao spade, with the Songze small plough in mid-process. The post-Liangzhu plows used draft animals. [ 114 ] [ 115 ]   Rice, cultivation of : In 2002, a Chinese and Japanese group reported the discovery in eastern China of fossilized phytoliths of domesticated rice apparently dating back to 11,900 BC or earlier. However, phytolith data are controversial in some quarters due to potential contamination problems. [ 116 ]  It is likely that demonstrated rice was cultivated in the middle  Yangtze Valley  by 7000 BC, as shown in finds from the Pengtoushan culture at Bashidang,  Changde ,  Hunan . By 5000 BC, rice had been domesticated at  Hemudu culture  near the  Yangtze Delta  and was being cooked in pots. [ 117 ]  Although millet remained the main crop in northern China throughout history, several sporadic attempts were made by the state to introduce rice around the  Bohai Gulf  as early as 1st century. [ 118 ]  At present, rice remains the main diet in  southern  and  northeastern  China as well as  Korea  and  Japan .   Salt, use of : The earliest salt use is argued to have taken place on  Lake Yuncheng ,  Shanxi  by 6000 BC. [ 119 ]  Strong archaeological evidence of salt making dating to 2000 BC is found in the ruins of Zhongba at  Chongqing . The historical records show that salt and iron monopolies often provided the bulk of state revenue, and remained important to state finance until the 20th century. [ 120 ] [ 121 ]  The  Discourse on Salt and Iron , written by Huan Kuan during the 1st century BC relates a debate on the state monopoly over salt and iron production and distribution.            Ladies processing new  silk , early 12th century painting in the style of  Zhang Xuan ,  Song Dynasty              A pottery  ding  vessel used for cooking from the  Yangshao culture  (c. 5000c. 3000 BC)              A  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC)  ivory  carving showing the  taotie  motif, dated 12th to 11th century BC         Silk : The oldest silk found in China comes from the  Chinese Neolithic period  and is dated to about 3630 BC, found in  Henan  province. [ 122 ]  Silk items excavated from the  Liangzhu culture  site at Qianshanyang,  Wuxing District ,  Zhejiang  date to roughly 2570 BC, and include silk threads, a braided silk belt, and a piece of woven silk. [ 122 ]  A bronze fragment found at the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC) site at  Anyang  (or  Yinxu ) contains the first known  written reference  to silk. [ 123 ]   Soybean, cultivation of : The cultivation of soybeans began in the eastern half of northern China by 2000 BC, but is almost certainly much older. [ 124 ]  Liu et al (1997) stated that soybean was first originated in China and was domesticated about 3500 BC. [ 125 ]  By the 5th century, soybeans were being cultivated in much of eastern Asia, but the crop did not move beyond this region until well into the 20th century. [ 126 ]  Written records of the cultivation and use of the soybean in China date back at least as far as the  Western Zhou Dynasty . [ 127 ]   Steamer, pottery appliance for cooking : Archaeological excavations shown that using steam to cook began with the pottery cooking vessels known as  yan  steamer; a  yan  composed of two vessesl, a  zeng  with perforated floor surmounted on a pot or caldron with a tripod base and a top cover. The earliest  yan  steamer dating from about 5000 BC was unearthed in the  Banpo  site. [ 128 ]  In the lower  Yangzi River ,  zeng  pots first appeared in the  Hemudu culture  (50004500 BC) and  Liangzhu culture  (32002000 BC) and used to steam rice; there are also  yan  steamers unearthed in several Liangzhu sites, including 3 found at the Chuodun and Luodun sites in southern  Jiangsu . [ 129 ]  In the  Longshan culture  (30002000 BC) site at Tianwang in western  Shandong , 3 large  yan  steamers were discovered. [ 130 ]  During the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC), symbols for different kinds of food appliances, including the  yan  steamer, were inscribed on the bronze vessels. [ 131 ]  They were also found in the 13th century BC  tomb of Fu Hao . [ 132 ]   Taotie motif : The  taotie  was a decorative mask motif found on artifacts. The earliest antecedent of  taotie  motif was found at the Gaomiao (54004800 BC) site in  Hunan  in 1991. The  taotie  motif are also found on the pottery and jade artifacts in the  Hemudu culture  (50004500 BC),  Longshan culture  (30002000 BC) in  Shandong ,  Shijiahe culture  (25002000 BC) and  Lower Xiajiadian culture  (22001600 BC). [ 133 ]  The most complicated design of the  taotie  motif found in the Neothilic sites comes from the ceremonial jades of  Liangzhu culture  (34002250 BC) sites at Fanshan and Yaoshan. [ 134 ]  The  taotie  motif of Longshan culture in Shandong and Bronze Age  Erlitou  site are considers as the mid-process example of late  Shang Dynasty . [ 133 ] [ 134 ]  Despite that  taotie  motif are commonly found on bronze vessels of the latter half of late  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC), it promptly went into decline and disappeared by the middle  Western Zhou Dynasty  (c. 1050771 BC). [ 134 ]  The  taotie  was first mentioned by name in the  Zuozhuan , while the earliest description and literary description of its appearance on  ding  comes from the  Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals . [ 133 ]   Treetrunk coffin : The treetrunk coffin, single trunk coffin or boat coffin was one of the common burials found mainly in the southern China. One of the few earliest boat coffins are found among the 92 burial tombs in the Songze culture (40003000 BC) site at  Jiaxing ,  Zhejiang , similar finds can also be found in the middle phase of  Dawenkou culture  (41002600 BC) sites. [ 62 ]  In 2006, a treetrunk coffin measuring 6.84 m in length, dating back to the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC), are found in a site at  Chengdu ,  Sichuan . [ 135 ]            A basin cover for a ""coffin urn"" from the Neolithic  Yangshao culture  (c. 5000c. 3000 BC), used for the burial of a child, from  Shaanxi         Urn, pottery burial : The first evidence of pottery urn dating from about 7000 BC comes from the early  Jiahu  site, where a total of 32 burial urns are found, [ 136 ]  another early finds are in Laoguantai,  Shaanxi . [ 62 ]  There are about 700 burial urns unearthed over the  Yangshao  (50003000 BC) areas and consisting more than 50 varieties of form and shape. The burial urns were used mainly for childs, but also sporadically for adults, as shown in the finds at Yichuan, Lushan and  Zhengzhou  in  Henan . [ 57 ]  A secondary burials containing bones from child or adult are found in the urns in Hongshanmiao, Henan. [ 137 ]  Small hole was drilled in most of the child and adult burial urns, and is believe to enable the spirit to access. [ 138 ]  It is recorded in the  Classic of Rites  that the earthenware coffins were used in the time of legendary period, [ 139 ]  the tradition of burying in pottery urns lasted until the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) when it gradually disappered. [ 62 ]  Most of the burial urns, starting from the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC), are found in areas of  Hebei  and  Liaoning . [ 140 ]   Vessel, use of skull as : The earliest archaeological evidence of vessels made of human skulls comes from a  Longshan culture  (3000 BC2000 BC) site at Jiangou,  Handan , where two were found. [ 141 ]  Another one at the northeastern quarter of the Bronze Age  Erligang site  dated to 14601384 BC, [ 142 ]  included refuse deposit of about 100 human skulls, mostly of young males that were sawn open at brow level. [ 143 ] [ 144 ]  Most of those skull vessels were contributed from prisoners of war and were used in rituals for  ancestor worship  during the early  Shang Dynasty . In literary records, writings concerning the use of skull vessel comes from the  Lushi Chunqiu ,  Hanfeizi ,  Huainanzi ,  Shiji ,  Shuoyuan  and  Zhan Guo Ce , which includes a reference to Zhibo (d. 455 BC), whose skull was made into a drinking cup by his enemy after being killed. [ 141 ] [ 145 ]       [ edit ]   Shang and later   Inventions which made their first appearance in China after the Neolithic age, specifically during and after the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC), are listed in alphabetical order below.     [ edit ]   A     Acupuncture : Acupuncture, the  traditional Chinese medicinal  practice of inserting needles into specific points of the body for therapeutic purposes and relieving pain, was first mentioned in the  Huangdi Neijing  compiled from the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC ( Warring States Period  to  Han Dynasty ). [ 146 ]  The oldest known acupuncture needles made of  gold , found in the tomb of  Liu Sheng  (d. 113 BC), date to the Western Han (202 BC9 AD); the oldest known stone-carved depiction of acupuncture was made during the Eastern Han (25220 AD); the oldest known bronze statue of an acupuncture  mannequin  dates to 1027 during the  Song Dynasty  (9601279). [ 147 ]  Acupuncture is still used to treat  pediatric nocturnal enuresis , i.e.  bedwetting . [ 148 ]             Bronze mirror  of the  Sui Dynasty  (581618) showing the twelve divisions of the  Chinese zodiac , the latter of which goes back to the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC) in China              A cylindrical bronze wine container made during the late  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC);  gentry scholars  of the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) excavated a number of ancient items and judged their age by examining their inscriptions, decorative motifs, and physical forms, compiling this information in archaeological catalogues commissioned by the state. Although archaeological interest in China waned after the Song, it was revived again during the mid 17th century ( Qing Dynasty ), with pursuits such as using ancient inscriptions to verify and correct the meanings of  characters  in  dictionaries . [ 149 ]               Emperor Yang of Sui  (r. 604617), in a posthumous portrait painting by the  Tang  artist  Yan Liben  (600673); he had automatic-opening doors installed in the private studies of his palatial library         Animal zodiac : The earliest and most complete version of the animal zodiac mentions twelve animals which differ slightly (for instance, the dragon is absent, represented by a worm). [ 150 ]  Each animal matches the  earthly branches  and were written on bamboo slips from  Shuihudi , dated to the late 4th century BC, [ 151 ]  as well as from Fangmatan, dating to the late 3rd century BC. [ 151 ]  Before these archaeological finds, the  Lunheng  written by  Wang Chong  (27c. 100 AD) during the 1st century provided the earliest transmitted example of a complete duodenary animal cycle. [ 152 ]   Archaeology, catalogues and epigraphy : During the  Song Dynasty  (9601279), the scholar  Ouyang Xiu  (10071072) analyzed alleged ancient artifacts bearing archaic  inscriptions in bronze and stone , which he preserved in a collection of some 400  rubbings ; [ 153 ]  Patricia Ebrey writes that he pioneered early ideas in  epigraphy . [ 154 ]  The  Kaogutu  () or ""Illustrated Catalogue of Examined Antiquity"" (preface dated 1092) compiled by L Dalin () (10461092) is one of the oldest known  catalogues  to systematically describe and classify ancient artifacts which were unearthed; it featured in writing and illustrations an assortment of 210  bronze  items and 13  jade  items of government and private collections that dated to the  Shang  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC) to  Han  (202 BC220 AD) dynasties. [ 155 ]  Another catalogue was the  Chong xiu Xuanhe bogutu  () or ""Revised Illustrated Catalogue of Xuanhe Profoundly Learned Antiquity"" (compiled from 1111 to 1125), commissioned by  Emperor Huizong of Song  (r. 11001125), and also featured illustrations of some 840 vessels and rubbings. [ 156 ] [ 149 ] [ 153 ]  This catalogue was criticized by Hong Mai () (11231202), who found that descriptions of certain ancient vessels dating to the Han Dynasty were incorrect when he compared them to actual Han Dynasty specimens he obtained for study. [ 156 ]  Song scholars established a formal system of dating these artifacts by examining their inscriptions, decorative motif styles, and physical shapes. [ 155 ]  Zhao Mingcheng () (10811129) stressed the importance of utilizing ancient inscriptions to correct discrepancies and errors in later texts discussing ancient events, such as with dates, geographical locations of historical events,  genealogies , and official titles. [ 157 ] [ 155 ] [ 153 ]  Ancient inscriptions on vessels were also used to revive ancient rituals for use in ceremonies. [ 155 ] [ 158 ]  Instead of stressing the revival of ancient rituals,  Shen Kuo  (10311095) was more interested in discovering ancient manufacturing techniques and functionality. [ 158 ]  Unlike many of his peers who attributed the crafting of ancient ritual vessels to sages of old, Shen asserted that they were merely products of  ancient artisans , just like in his time. [ 158 ]  Shen also incorporated his study of ancient relics  into other disciplines , such as  music ,  mathematics , and  optics . [ 158 ]  Shen examined carved reliefs of the Zhuwei Tomb and concluded that they  displayed Han Dynasty era clothing . [ 158 ]  Shen unearthed a  surveying  tool in a garden of  Jiangsu  which Joseph Needham asserts was  Jacob's staff . [ 159 ]  Bruce G. Trigger writes that interests in  antiquarian  studies of ancient inscriptions and artifacts waned after the Song Dynasty, but were revived by early  Qing Dynasty  (16441912) scholars such as  Gu Yanwu  (16131682) and  Yan Ruoju  (16361704). [ 149 ]  Craig Clunas also states that epigraphic studies weren't revived until the Qing Dynasty, but that printed copies of the  Chong xiu Xuanhe bogutu  were widely circulated in the 16th century during the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644). [ 160 ]  Trigger asserts that  archaeology  as a discipline of its own never developed in China and was always considered a branch of  historiography  instead. [ 161 ]   Anti-malarial properties of artemisia : The  antimalarial  drug of compound  artemisinin  found in  Artemisia annua , the latter being a plant long used in  traditional Chinese medicine , was discovered in 1972 by  Chinese scientists in the People's Republic  led by Tu Youyou () and has been used to treat multi-drug resistant strains of  Plasmodium falciparum  malaria. [ 162 ] [ 163 ]   Armillary sphere, hydraulic-powered :  Hipparchus  (c. 190c. 120 BC) [ 164 ]  (probably in  Geographica  from 1st century AD) [ 165 ]  credited the Greek  Eratosthenes  (276194 BC) as the first to invent the armillary sphere representing the  celestial sphere . However, the Chinese astronomer Geng Shouchang of the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) invented it separately in China in 52 BC, while the polymath  Zhang Heng  (78139 AD) was the first to apply motive power to the rotating armillary sphere by a set of complex gears rotated by a  waterwheel  which in turn was powered by the constant  pressure head  of an inflow  clepsydra clock , the latter of which he improved with an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. [ 166 ] [ 167 ] [ 168 ] [ 169 ] [ 170 ] [ 171 ]   Automatic opening doors, foot-activated trigger :  Emperor Yang  (r. 604617) of the  Sui Dynasty  (581618) had a private library installed in the Guanwen Hall of the palace at the capital of  Daxing  (modern  Xi'an ), having a total of fourteen studies with luxurious apparel and furniture. [ 172 ]  At every third study there was a square door with curtains suspended above it as well as two figurine statues of flying immortals. [ 172 ]  In the emperor's entourage were serving maids holding ""perfume burners""; as he walked towards any of these entrances, they would walk in front of him and press their feet down on a trigger mechanism which not only caused the  flying immortals  to sweep down and pull the curtains out of the way, but made the door-halves swing backwards and opened all the cabinet doors to the book cases within the study. [ 172 ]  When the emperor exited the study, the trigger was activated again and everything returned to its closed original state. [ 172 ]  It should be noted the Chinese were not the first to invent automatic opening doors, which were invented for a 1st century  Roman temple  designed by  Heron of Alexandria  (c. 1070 AD), although his did not involve a foot-activated trigger mechanism, [ 172 ]  but worked with the aid of steam power. [ 173 ]       [ edit ]   B           Huizi currency , issued in 1160              Barrels of  sake  at  Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g ,  Kamakura ,  Japan ; sake is derived from a strong  beer  which existed in China since roughly the 11th century BC               Blast furnace   bellows  operated by  waterwheels , from a book published by  Wang Zhen  in 1313,  Yuan Dynasty               The Spinning Wheel , by  Northern Song  (9601127) artist Wang Juzheng; the Chinese invented the  belt drive  by the 1st century BC for silk  quilling  devices. This was essential for the invention of the later  spinning wheel , the latter invented in either  China  or  India  around the 11th century and was first mentioned in  Europe  in the statutes of a guild at  Speyer ,  Germany  in about 1280. [ 174 ]              A  bird-and-flower painting  by Li Anzhong, early 12th century, album leaf on silk, 25.4 by 26.9 cm              A print illustration from an encyclopedia published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing  (15871666), showing two men working a  blast furnace  on the right and the  puddling process  on the left.              Chinese river ships from  Along the River During Qingming Festival , by  Zhang Zeduan  (10851145),  Song Dynasty         Banknote : Paper currency was  first developed in China . Its roots were in merchant  receipts  of deposit during the  Tang Dynasty  (618907), as  merchants  and  wholesalers  desired to avoid the heavy bulk of  copper coinage  in large commercial transactions. [ 175 ] [ 176 ] [ 177 ]  During the  Song Dynasty  (9601279), the central government adopted this system for their monopolized salt industry, but a gradual reduction in copper productiondue to closed mines and an enormous outflow of Song-minted copper currency into the  Japanese ,  Southeast Asian ,  Western Xia , and  Liao Dynasty  economiesencouraged the Song government in the early 12th century to issue government-printed paper currency alongside copper to ease the demand on their state mints and debase the value of copper. [ 178 ]  In the early 11th century, the Song Dynasty government authorized sixteen private  banks  to issue notes of exchange in  Sichuan , but in 1023 the government commandeered this enterprise and set up an agency to supervise the manufacture of banknotes there. [ 179 ]  The earliest paper currency was limited to certain regions and could not be used outside specified bounds, but once paper was securely backed by gold and silver stores, the Song Dynasty government initiated a nationwide paper currency, sometime between 1265 and 1274. [ 177 ]  The concurrent  Jin Dynasty  (11151234) also printed paper banknotes by at least 1214. [ 180 ]   Beer, alcohol content above 11% (i.e. sake) : Ordinary  beer  in the ancient world, from  Babylonia  to  Ancient Egypt , had an alcoholic content of 4% to 5%, while no beer  in the West  reached an alcohol content above 11% until the 12th century, when  distilled alcohol  was made in  Italy . [ 181 ]  Ordinary beer was consumed in China during the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC) and was even mentioned on Shang  oracle bone  inscriptions as offerings to spirits during sacrifices. [ 182 ]  Robert Temple writes: ""The major problem with ordinary beer is that the  starch  in grain cannot be  fermented . Thousands of years ago, it was found that sprouting grain contains a substance (the  enzyme  now known as  amylase ) which degrades the starch of grain into sugars which can then be fermented. This was the basis of ancient beer around the world."" [ 182 ]  Yet sometime around 1000 BC the Chinese created an alcoholic beverage which was stronger than 11%, a new drink which was  mentioned in poetry  throughout the  Zhou Dynasty  (c. 1050256 BC). [ 182 ]  The new process created  xiao mi jiu  (), which Temple describes: ""This consisted of ground, partially cooked wheat (or occasionally millet) grains which had been allowed to go  moldy . These molds produce the starch-digestive enzyme amylase more efficiently than does sprouting grain. [This drink] therefore was a mixture of molds plus  yeast . The Chinese would mix it with cooked grain in water, which resulted in beer. The amylase broke the starch down into surgar and the yeast fermented this into alcohol."" [ 182 ]  The Chinese discovered that adding more cooked grain in water during fermentation increased alcohol content. [ 183 ]  This process is the same one that later  Japanese  utilized to make  sake , or  Nihonshu  . [ 184 ]   Bellows, hydraulic-powered : Although it is unknown if metallurgic bellows (i.e. air-blowing device) in the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) were of the leather bag type or the wooden fan type found in the later  Yuan Dynasty  (12791368), the Eastern Han official  Du Shi  (d. 38 AD) applied the use of rotating  waterwheels  to power the bellows of his  blast furnace  smelting  iron , a method which continued in use in China thereafter, as evidenced by subsequent records; it is a significant invention in that iron production yields were increased and it employed all the necessary components for converting rotary motion into  reciprocating motion . [ 185 ] [ 186 ] [ 187 ] [ 170 ] [ 188 ]   Belt drive : The mechanical belt drive, with a large wheel and small  pulley , was first mentioned by the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) author  Yang Xiong  (5318 BC) in 15 BC, used for a  quilling  machine that wound  silk  fibers on to  bobbins  for  weavers'  shuttles. [ 189 ]  It was also featured in a  Three Kingdoms  era book of 230232, and was not only later refined as the  chain drive , but is an essential component to the invention of the  spinning wheel . [ 190 ]  In 1090, Qin Guan's book on  textiles  and  sericulture  written during the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) described a mechanical belt drive for a silk-reeling device. [ 191 ]  An illustration of a woman operating a multiple-spindle spinning wheel with a continuous driving belt is featured in the  Book of Agriculture  published in 1313 by  Wang Zhen  (fl. 12901333). [ 192 ]  This silk-handling machinery was a type of flyer which laid thread evenly on  reels . [ 193 ]  By the 14th century,  hydraulic power  was applied to spinning  mills  in China for this purpose. [ 193 ]   Bird-and-flower painting : Bird-and-flower painting () is an intimate style of nature painting which was developed in the  Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period  (907960) and blossomed during the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) as a definitive court art favored by patrons such as  Emperor Huizong of Song  (r. 11001125). [ 194 ]  Beginning with the latter's reign, paintings such as these were often coupled with  lines of poetry  in small album leaves. [ 194 ]  This unique style of Song painting was later revived by the  Zhe School  of art during the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644). [ 195 ]   Blast furnace : Although  cast iron  tools and weapons have been found in China dating to the 5th century BC, the earliest discovered Chinese blast furnaces, which produced  pig iron  that could be remelted and refined as  cast iron  in the  cupola furnace , date to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, while the vast majority of early blast furnace sites discovered date to the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) period  immediately following 117 BC with the establishment of state monopolies over the salt and iron industries  during the reign of  Emperor Wu of Han  (r. 14187 BC); most ironwork sites discovered dating before 117 BC acted merely as  foundries  which made castings for iron that had been smelted in blast furnaces elsewhere in remote areas far from population centers. [ 196 ] [ 197 ]   Bomb, cast iron : The first accounts of bombs made of  cast iron  shells packed with explosive  gunpowder as opposed to earlier types of casingswas written in the 13th century in China. [ 198 ]  The term was coined for this bomb (i.e. ""thunder-crash bomb"") during a  Jin Dynasty  (11151234) naval battle of 1231 against the  Mongols , yet the written account did not explicitly state that iron was used. [ 199 ]  The  History of Jin   (compiled by 1345) states that in 1232, as the Mongol general  Subutai  (11761248) descended on the Jin stronghold of  Kaifeng , the defenders had a ""thunder-crash bomb"" which ""consisted of gunpowder put into an iron container...then when the fuse was lit (and the projectile shot off) there was a great explosion the noise whereof was like thunder, audible for more than a hundred  li , and the vegetation was scorched and blasted by the heat over an area of more than  half a  mou . When hit, even  iron armour  was quite pierced through."" [ 199 ]  The  Song Dynasty  (9601279) official Li Zengbo wrote in 1257 that  arsenals  should have several hundred thousand iron bomb shells available and that when he was in  Jingzhou , about one to two thousand were produced each month for dispatch of ten to twenty thousand at a time to  Xiangyang  and Yingzhou. [ 200 ]  The significance of this, as Joseph Needham states, is that a ""high- nitrate  gunpowder mixture had been reached at last, since nothing less would have burst the iron casing."" [ 201 ]   Borehole drilling : By at least the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD), the Chinese used deep borehole drilling for mining and other projects, such as using a  derrick  to lift liquid  brine  to the surface through a  bamboo pipeline  that led to a distilling furnace (which Michael Loewe says was heated by  natural gas ) where  salt  could be processed; scenes of this entire process are featured in artwork on Han tomb brick reliefs of  Sichuan  province, while Loewe states that borehole sites could reach as deep as 600 m (2000 ft). [ 202 ]  K.S. Tom describes the drilling process: ""The Chinese method of deep drilling was accomplished by a team of men jumping on and off a beam to impact the drilling bit while the boring tool was rotated by buffalo and oxen."" [ 203 ]  This was the same method used for extracting  petroleum  in  California  during the 1860s (i.e. ""Kicking Her Down""). [ 203 ]  A Western Han Dynasty bronze foundry discovered in Xinglong,  Hebei  had nearby  mining shafts  (built to extract  copper  which could be smelt with  tin  to make bronze) which reached depths of 100 m (328 ft) into the earth with spacious mining areas; the shafts and rooms were complete with a timber frame, ladders, and iron tools. [ 204 ] [ 205 ]   Bristle toothbrush : According to a Library of Congress website, the Chinese have used the bristle toothbrush since 1498, during the reign of the  Hongzhi Emperor  (r. 14871505) of the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644); it also adds that the toothbrush was not mass-produced until 1780, when they were sold by a William Addis of Clerkenwald,  England . [ 206 ]  In accordance with the Library of Congress website, scholar John Bowman also writes that the bristle toothbrush using pig bristles was invented in China during the 1490s. [ 26 ]  While Bonnie L. Kendall agrees with this, she noted that a predecessor existed in  ancient Egypt  in the form of a twig that was frayed at the end. [ 207 ]   Bulkhead partition : The 5th century book  Garden of Strange Things  by Liu Jingshu mentioned that a ship could allow water to enter the bottom without sinking, while the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) author  Zhu Yu  (fl. 12th century) wrote in his book of 1119 that the  hulls  of  Chinese ships  had a bulkhead build; these pieces of literary evidence for bulkhead partitions are confirmed by archaeological evidence of a 24 m (78 ft) long Song Dynasty ship dredged from the waters off the southern coast of China in 1973, the hull of the ship divided into twelve walled compartmental sections built  watertight , dated to about 1277. [ 208 ] [ 209 ]  Western writers from  Marco Polo  (12541324), to  Niccol Da Conti  (13951469), to  Benjamin Franklin  (17061790) commented on bulkhead partitions, which they viewed as an original aspect of Chinese shipbuilding, as Western shipbuilding did not incorporate this hull arrangement until the early 19th century. [ 210 ] [ 211 ]       [ edit ]   C           Guo Shoujing  (12331316) established a calendar in 1281 which measured a year in roughly the same length as the Western  Gregorian calendar  of 1582              A  cast iron  garment hook with gold and silver foil, from the  Eastern Zhou Dynasty , 4th century BC              The  wu xing , or Chinese Five Elements, with green representing wood and east, red representing fire and south, yellow representing earth and center, white representing metal and west, and black representing water and north              A late 10th century grey  sandstone  and celadon -glazed pitcher from the  Song Dynasty  (9601279); the spout is in the form of a  fenghuang  head.              The endless power-transmitting  chain drive  from  Su Song 's book of 1094 describing his  clock tower [ 212 ]               Bellows  were used not only in  metallurgy  by the ancient Chinese, but also in  chemical warfare .              Illustration of chopsticks              The  Xuande Emperor  (r. 14251435) playing  chuiwan  with his  eunuchs              A Chinese  dao  ( sabre ); co-fusion  steel , a mixture of  wrought iron  and  cast iron , was used to craft  these swords  as well as  sickles  by the 6th century               Knife money  from the  State of Yan , dated to the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC)              A window crank; the Chinese have used the crank since the last 2,000 years at least              A hand-held, trigger-operated  crossbow  from the 2nd century BC,  Han Dynasty ; as proven by the archaeological find at  Qufu , the Chinese have used the crossbow since at least the 6th century BC. [ 213 ]              A 15th century  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) woodblock print of the  Water Margin  novel showing a game of  cuju  football being played; the Chinese have been playing  cuju  football since the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC), according to the  Records of the Grand Historian  compiled by 91 BC.              An earthenware model of a stove furnace from the  Eastern Han Dynasty  (25220 AD); the Chinese have been using the  cupola furnace  since antiquity.              In his work of 1585, the  Flemish  mathematician  Simon Stevin  (15481620), pictured above, published the first significant work in  Europe  dealing with  decimal fractions , yet their use in China spans back to at least the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD). [ 214 ]              The frontispiece to  Hu Sihui 's  Principles of Correct Diet  published in 1330 ( Yuan Dynasty ); the caption reads ""Many diseases can be cured by diet alone,"" a belief which spanned back to at least the 3rd century AD in China. [ 215 ]              A standard thirty-two-piece set of  Chinese dominoes , which have existed since at least the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) and differ from  dominoes  found  in the West  by number of pieces and exclusion of blank face pieces; traditionally, Chinese dominoes were made of wood or  ivory . [ 216 ]              Ceramic models of watchtowers from the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) showing use of  dougong  brackets;  dougong  were used in  Chinese architecture  since roughly the 11th century BC, during the early  Zhou Dynasty .              A giant  drawloom  for figure  weaving , from the  Chinese   Tiangong Kaiwu   encyclopedia  published by  Song Yingxing  in 1637              A  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) illustration showing the process of  sublimation  of  mercury(I) chloride , the man on the left seen brushing the crystals from the sublimation lid by using a feather; the same process was used in the sublimation of crystals of  sex  and  pituitary  hormones derived from evaporated human urine. [ 217 ]              Each  bronze bell of Marquis Yi of Zeng  (433 BC) bears an inscription describing the specific note it plays, its position on a  12-note scale , and how this scale differed from scales  used by other Chinese states  of the time; before this discovery in 1978, [ 218 ]  the oldest known surviving Chinese tuning set came from  a 3rd century BC text  (which alleges was written by  Guan Zhong , d. 645 BC) with 5 tones and additions or subtractions of  of successive tone values which produce the  rising fourths and falling fifths  of  Pythagorean tuning . [ 219 ]              An original print illustration of 1094 showing the inner workings of  Su Song 's (10201101)  clock tower , featuring an  escapement  mechanism and the world's oldest known  chain drive         Calendar year at 365.2425 days : In the late  Spring and Autumn Period  (722481 BC), the former Sifen calendar () was established, and set the  tropical year  at 365.25 days (the same length of the  Julian calendar ). [ 220 ]  The Taichu calendar () of 104 BC under  Emperor Wu of Han  rendered the tropical year at roughly the same (365  ). [ 220 ]  Many other calendars were established between then and the  Yuan Dynasty  (12711368), including those established by  Li Chunfeng  (602670) and  Yi Xing  (683727). [ 220 ]  In 1281, the Yuan astronomer  Guo Shoujing  (12331316) fixed the calendar at 365.2425 days, the same as the  Gregorian calendar  established in 1582; this calendar, the Shoushi calendar (), would be used in China for the next 363 years. [ 221 ] [ 222 ]  Guo Shoujing established the new calendar with the aid of his own achievements in  spherical trigonometry , which he derived largely from the work of  Shen Kuo  (10311095) who  established trigonometry in China . [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ]   Cast iron : Confirmed by archaeological evidence, cast iron, made from melting  pig iron , was developed in China by the early 5th century BC during the  Zhou Dynasty  (1122256 BC), the oldest specimens found in a tomb of Luhe County in  Jiangsu  province; despite this, most of the early  blast furnaces  and  cupola furnaces  discovered in China date after the state iron monopoly under  Emperor Wu  (r. 14187 BC) was established in 117 BC, during the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD); Donald Wagner states that a possible reason why no ancient Chinese  bloomery  process has been discovered thus far is because the iron monopoly, which lasted until the 1st century AD when it was abolished for private entrepreneurship and local administrative use, wiped out any need for continuing the less-efficient bloomery process that continued in use in other parts of the world. [ 226 ] [ 196 ] [ 227 ] [ 228 ] [ 229 ]  Wagner states that most iron tools in ancient China were made of cast iron in consideration of the low economic burden of producing cast iron, whereas most  iron military weapons  were made of more costly  wrought iron  and  steel , signifying that ""high performance was essential"" and preferred for the latter. [ 230 ]   Cardinal direction, use of colors for : In ancient China, the use of five different soil colors corresponding to the four cardinal directions were used in construction of altars and mounds. [ 231 ] [ 232 ] [ 233 ]  The earliest archaeologial evidence of such example comes from a  Spring and Autumn Period  (722481 BC) burial site located at Shuangdun,  Anhui . [ 234 ]  The mentions of the ""five colors"" are recorded in the  Shujing  and  Zuozhuan , while the earliest information on correlative colors associated with each four cardinal directions and center; east (blue), south (red), west (white), north (black) and center (yellow), comes from the  Kaogongji , [ 235 ]  an independent work complied in the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC) before being attached to the  Rites of Zhou  in place of the original missing section ""Winter Office"" (lost in its entirety) by the mid 2nd century BC. [ 236 ] [ 237 ] [ 238 ]   Cavalieri's principle : This mathematical principle, which states that the volumes of two objects are equal if the areas of their  corresponding cross sections  are in all cases equal, is named after the  Italian  mathematician  Bonaventura Cavalieri  (15981647), yet it was first pioneered in the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) mathematical treatise  The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art  (written by at least 179 AD), and commented on by the  Wei Dynasty  (220265) mathematician  Liu Hui . [ 239 ]   Celadon :  Named after a pale-tinted spring green color , Wang Zhongshu (1982) asserts that shards having this type of  ceramic glaze  have been recovered from  Eastern Han Dynasty  (25220 AD) tomb excavations in  Zhejiang ; he also asserts that this type of ceramic became well known during the  Three Kingdoms  (220265). [ 240 ]  Richard Dewar (2002) disagrees with Wang's classification, stating that true celadonwhich requires a minimum 1260C (2300F) furnace temperature, a preferred range of 2850 to 1305C (2345 to 2381F), and reduced firingwas not created until the beginning of the  Northern Song Dynasty  (9601127). [ 241 ]  The unique grey or green celadon glaze is a result of  iron oxide 's transformation from  ferric  to  ferrous  iron (Fe 2 O 3   FeO) during the firing process. [ 241 ]   Longquan celadon  wares, which Nigel Wood (1999) writes were first made during the Northern Song, had bluish, blue-green, and olive green glazes and high  silica  and  alkali  contents which resembled later  porcelain  wares made at  Jingdezhen  and  Dehua  rather than  stonewares . [ 242 ]   Chain drive, endless power-transmitting : The Greek  Philon of Byzantium  (3rd or 2nd century BC) [ 243 ]  described a  chain drive  and  windlass  used in the operation of a  polybolos  (a repeating  ballista ), [ 244 ] [ 245 ]  but the chain drive did not continuously transmit power from shaft to shaft. [ 246 ] [ 212 ]  A continuously driven chain drive first appeared in 11th-century China. Perhaps inspired by  chain pumps  which had been known in China since at least the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) when they were mentioned by the Chinese philosopher  Wang Chong  (27c.100 AD), [ 247 ]  the endless power-transmitting chain drive was first used in the gearing of the  clock tower  built at  Kaifeng  in 1090 by the official, mathematician, and astronomer  Su Song  (10201101) during the  Song Dynasty  (9601279); in addition to the  escapement  mechanism invented earlier in the 8th century, the chain drive was used to mechanically rotate the tower's  armillary sphere  crowning the top (which imitated the movements of the stars in the  celestial sphere ) and move one of 600 mechanical gear teeth forward every 2 minutes and 24 seconds, thus each gear tooth represented   of a 24 hour day,  each hour announced by one of 133 clock jack figurines  rotated on a mechanical wheel behind opening windows where they could be seen banging gongs, drums, bells, and holding plaques for special times of day. [ 248 ] [ 249 ] [ 250 ]   Chemical warfare using bellows, mustard smoke, and lime : As written in the 4th century BC by the  Mohists , followers of the philosophy of  Mozi  (c. 470c. 391 BC), the Chinese of the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC) applied the use of burnt balls of the  mustard plant  (not to be confused with modern  sulfur mustard , or 'mustard gas') as a lethal agent in warfare. [ 251 ]  During a  siege , the besieging force would often  dig mines under the walls  to breach the fortifications of the defenders. [ 251 ]  As written by the Mohists, the defenders also had the option of digging to meet the enemy's underground tunnel, where  bellows  connected to furnaces above could be used to pump toxic smoke of burnt mustard and other vegetable material into the shafts. [ 251 ]   To fight off a peasant revolt  in 178 AD during the late  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD), riding  charioteers  of the Imperial forces used portable bellows to pump  lime smoke  at the enemy, who were ultimately defeated. [ 252 ]  Powdered lime was also used in lobbed  tear gas  bombs, such as when the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) general  Yue Fei  (11031142) used them with great success against the bandit leader Yang Yao in 1135; when the lime formed a thick fog in the air, Yang's ""rebel soldiers could not open their eyes"" according to the account of his campaign. [ 252 ]   Chinese remainder theorem : The Chinese remainder theorem, including  simultaneous congruences  in  number theory , was first created by the mathematician  Sunzi  in the 3rd century AD, whose  Mathematical Classic by Sun Zi  (,  Sunzi suanjing ) posed the problem: ""There is an unknown number of things, when divided by 3 it leaves 2, when divided by 5 it leaves 3, and when divided by 7 it leaves a remainder of 2. Find the number."" [ 253 ]  This method of calculation was used in calendrical mathematics by  Tang Dynasty  (618907) mathematicians such as  Li Chunfeng  (602670) and  Yi Xing  (683727) in order to determine the length of the ""Great Epoch"", the lapse of time between the conjunctions of the moon, sun, and Five Planets ( those discerned by the naked eye ). [ 253 ]  Thus, it was strongly associated with the  divination  methods of the ancient  Yijing . [ 253 ]  Its use was lost for centuries until  Qin Jiushao  (c. 12021261) revived it in his  Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections  of 1247, providing  constructive proof  for it. [ 253 ]   Chopsticks : The historian  Sima Qian  (14586 BC) wrote in the  Records of the Grand Historian  that  King Zhou of Shang  was the first to make chopsticks out of  ivory  in the 11th century BC; the most ancient archaeological find of a pair of chopsticks, made of bronze, comes from Shang Tomb 1005 at Houjiazhuang,  Anyang , dated roughly 1200 BC. By 600 BC, the use of chopsticks had spread to  Yunnan  (Dapona in  Dali ), [ 254 ] [ 255 ]  and  Tv Province  by 1st century. [ 256 ]  The earliest known textual reference to the use of chopsticks comes from the  Han Feizi , a philosophical text written by  Han Fei  (c. 280233 BC) in the 3rd century BC. [ 257 ]   Chromium, use of : The use of chromium was invented in China no later than 210 BC, the date when the  Terracotta Army  was interred at a site not far from modern  Xi'an ; modern archaeologists discovered that bronze-tipped  crossbow  bolts at the site showed no sign of corrosion after more than 2,000 years of being interred, the reason being that the Chinese had coated the bronze tips of their crossbow bolts in chromium; chromium was not used anywhere else until the experiments of  Louis Nicolas Vauquelin  (17631829) in 17971798. [ 258 ]   Chuiwan (Chinese golf) :  Chuiwan , a game similar to the  Scottish -derived sport of  golf , was first mentioned in China by Wei Tai (fl. 10501100) in his  Dongxuan Records  (); [ 259 ]  it was popular amongst men and women in the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) and  Yuan Dynasty  (12791368), while it was popular among urban men in the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) in much the same way that  tennis  was for urban  Europeans  during the  Renaissance  (according to Andrew Leibs). [ 260 ]  In 1282, Ning Zhi published the  Book of Chuiwan , which described the rules, equipment, and playing field of  chuiwan , as well as included commentary of those who mastered its tactics. [ 260 ]   Chuiwan  clubs, 10 in all for each player, were stored in a brocaded case. [ 261 ]  The  chuiwan  clubs  used by the emperor  were lavishly decked in  gold  and  inlaid with jade . [ 261 ]  The game was played on flat and sloping grassland terrain andmuch like the  tee  of modern golfhad a ""base"" area where the first of three strokes were played. [ 262 ]   Civil service examinations : In the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD), the  xiaolian  system of recruiting government officials through formal recommendations was the chief method of filling bureaucratic posts, although there was an  Imperial Academy  to train potential candidates for office and some offices required its candidates to pass formal written tests before appointment. [ 263 ] [ 264 ] [ 265 ] [ 266 ]  However, it was not until the  Sui Dynasty  (581618) that  civil service  examinations became open to all adult males not belonging to the  merchant class  (although having wealth or noble status were not requirements) and were used as a universal prerequisite for appointments to office, at least in theory. [ 267 ] [ 268 ]  During the Sui and  Tang Dynasty  (618907), the civil service system was actually implemented on a much smaller scale than during the  Song Dynasty  (9601279), when an elite core of dynastic-founding and professional families lost their majority in government to a broad strata of lesser  gentry families  from throughout the country. [ 269 ] [ 270 ]  To ensure that examinations were relatively fair (despite difficult requirements and privilege of the better educated), the authorities employed numerous methods such as hiring a bureau of  copyists  to copy each candidate's examination answers to avoid favoritism by graders who could recognize one's signature  calligraphy style . [ 271 ] [ 272 ]   Co-fusion steel process : Although both Robert Temple and  Joseph Needham  speculate that it could have existed beforehand, the first clear written evidence of the fusion of  wrought iron  and  cast iron  to make  steel  comes from the 6th century AD in regards to the  Daoist  swordsmith Qiwu Huaiwen, who was put in charge of the arsenal of  Northern Wei  general  Gao Huan  (496597, later honored as Emperor Xianwu by  Northern Qi ) from 543 to 550 AD. [ 273 ] [ 274 ]  The  Tang Dynasty  (618907)  Newly Reorganized Pharmacopoeia  of 659 also described this process of mixing and heating wrought iron and cast iron together, stating that the steel product was used to make  sickles  and  Chinese sabers . [ 273 ]  In regards to the latter text,  Su Song  (10201101) made a similar description and noted the steel's use for  making swords . [ 273 ]  In his encyclopedia of 1637, the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) author  Song Yingxing  (15871666) was the first to describe the process at length, stating that the wrought iron was first beaten into tiny thin plates, packed into wrought iron sheets, and then pressed down with cast iron piled on top. [ 273 ]  The cast iron would melt first in the furnace, ""dripping and soaking"" into the wrought iron; once united, they were taken out and forged, heated, and hammered in a process repeated numerous times. [ 273 ]  Temple and Needham both state that this anticipated the  open hearth furnace  later invented by  Carl Wilhelm Siemens  (18231883). [ 274 ] [ 275 ]   Coin, knife and spade-shaped : Robert S. Wicks states that the  cowry shell  was used as a primitive form of currency during the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC). [ 276 ]  During the  Zhou Dynasty  (c. 1050256 BC) the use of  bronze  coins in  various shapes and sizes , such as circular coins with either a rounded or square hole in the center (to fit a string through), [ 277 ]  came into general use. The  knife -shaped and  spade -shaped coins, styles unique to China, also came into use during the Zhou period; as proven by archaeological excavations, these coin were common in the  State of Yan ,  State of Qi ,  State of Zhao ,  State of Han ,  State of Chu ,  State of Liang , and  State of Qin , with dates ranging from the  Spring and Autumn Period  (722481 BC) to the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC). [ 278 ]  The historian  Sima Qian  (14586 BC) in his  Records of the Grand Historian  (91 BC) wrote that in ancient times, tortoise shells, cowry shells, knives, and gold were used as forms of currency. [ 279 ]   Coke as fuel : By the 11th century, during the  Song Dynasty  (9601279), the demands for  charcoal  used in the  blast  and  cupola furnaces  of the iron industry led to large amounts of  deforestation  of prime timberland; to avoid excessive deforestation, the Song Chinese began using coke made from  bituminous coal  as fuel for their metallurgic furnaces instead of charcoal derived from wood. [ 280 ] [ 281 ] [ 282 ]   Contour canal : After numerous conquests and consolidation of  his empire , China's first emperor  Qin Shi Huang  (r. 221210 BC) commissioned the engineer Shi Lu (fl. late 3rd century BC) to build a new waterway canal which would pass through a mountain range and link together the  Xiang River  and  Lijiang River . [ 50 ] [ 283 ]  The result of this project was the  Lingqu Canal , complete with thirty-six  lock gates , and since it closely follows a  contour line  (i.e. following the contours of the  natural saddle in the hills ), it is the oldest known contour canal in the world. [ 50 ] [ 284 ]  According to  Sima Qian  (14586 BC) in his  Records of the Grand Historian  (compiled by 91 BC), the canal project was initiated to effectively send supplies of grain south to the armies of  Zhao Tuo  in the conquest of the  Yue peoples . [ 283 ]   Crank handle : The earliest known depicted crank handle in art comes from a 1st century BC  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) green-glazed pottery tomb model of a farmyard, complete with a rotary grain mill, a man operating a foot tilt hammer for pounding grain, and to his left a  winnowing  machine with a crank handle used to  operate the fan . [ 285 ] [ 286 ]  The crank handle in later Imperial China (Tang and Song dynasties) was also used in grain mills, silk-reeling and hemp-spinning machines, the hydraulic-powered flour-sifter, the hydraulic powered  bellows , the water well  windlass , and other devices. [ 287 ]   Crossbow, handheld : In China, bronze  crossbow  bolts dating as early as mid 5th century BC were found at a  State of Chu  burial site in Yutaishan,  Hubei . [ 288 ]  The earliest handheld crossbow stocks with bronze trigger, dating from the 6th century BC, comes from Tomb 3 and 12 found at  Qufu ,  Shandong , capital of the  State of Lu . [ 213 ] [ 289 ]  Other early finds of crossbows were discovered in Tomb 138 at Saobatang,  Hunan  dated to mid 4th century BC. [ 290 ] [ 291 ]   Repeating crossbows , first mentioned in the  Records of the Three Kingdoms , were discovered in 1986 in Tomb 47 at Qinjiazui, Hubei dated to around 4th century BC. [ 292 ]  The earliest textual evidence of the handheld crossbow  used in battle  dates to the 4th century BC. [ 293 ]  Handheld crossbows with complex bronze trigger mechanisms have also been found with the  Terracotta Army  in the tomb of  Qin Shihuang  (r. 221210 BC) that are similar to specimens from the subsequent  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD), while crossbowmen described in the Han Dynasty learned drill formations, some were even mounted as  cavalry units , and Han Dynasty writers attributed the success of numerous  battles against the Xiongnu  to massed crossbow fire. [ 294 ] [ 295 ]   Chao Cuo  (d. 154 BC) wrote a memorial to the throne in 169 BC which included his assertion that the Chinese crossbow was superior to the  Xiongnu  bow. [ 296 ]  In a cross comparison with a contemporary civilization which created an early crossbow, the  ancient Greeks  had a crossbow known as the  gastraphetes  (""belly-bow"", so named because the shooter had to draw the bow by pressing his stomach against the concave rear), which was described in  Heron's   Belopoeica  (1st century AD), [ 297 ]  yet some scholars assert that the handheld crossbow (as invented in China) was not seen in Europe until the 10th century AD. [ 298 ] [ 299 ] [ 300 ]  Unlike the Chinese crossbow, the heavy weight and bulk of the  gastraphetes  necessitated a prop to keep it standing, i.e. by mounting it on a defensive wall or using a portable prop. [ 301 ]   Cuju (football) : The game of  football  known as  cuju  was first mentioned in China by two historical texts; the  Zhan Guo Ce  (compiled from the 3rd to 1st centuries BC) and the  Records of the Grand Historian  (published in 91 BC) by  Sima Qian  (14586 BC). [ 302 ]  Both texts recorded that during the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC) the people of  Linzi  city, capital of the  State of Qi , enjoyed playing  cuju  along with partaking in many other pastimes such as  cockfighting . [ 302 ]  Besides being a recreational sport, playing  cuju  was also considered a military training exercise and means for soldiers to keep fit. [ 302 ]  Both Sima Qian [ 303 ]  and  Ban Gu  (3292 AD) in his  Book of Han  wrote that the general  Huo Qubing  (140117 BC), after leading his troops north to attack the nomadic  Xiongnu , allowed his soldiers to construct a playing field for  cuju  football. [ 302 ]   Cupola furnace : Vincent C. Pigott states that the cupola furnace existed in China at least by the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC), [ 304 ]  while Donald B. Wagner writes that some  iron ore  melted in the  blast furnace  may have been  cast directly into molds , but most, if not all, iron smelted in the blast furnace during the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) was remelted in a cupola furnace; it was designed so that a  cold blast  injected at the bottom traveled through  tuyere  pipes across the top where the charge (i.e. of  charcoal  and scrap or  pig iron ) was dumped, the air becoming a  hot blast  before reaching the bottom of the furnace where the iron was melted and then drained into appropriate molds for casting. [ 305 ]  Pigott states that even in modern cupola furnaces, sometimes an excess of injected  oxygen  will cause enough  decarburization  that a resulting lump of low-carbon iron will appear in the furnace, similar to the  wrought iron  of the  bloomery ; although the ancient Chinese had produced wrought iron (no doubt, Pigott says, from the cupola furnace) from about the same time (c. 500 BC) cast iron appeared during the very late  Spring and Autumn Period  (722481 BC), there is no direct evidence that the bloomery ever existed in China. [ 306 ]       [ edit ]   D     Decimal fractions : As proven by inscriptions from the 13th century BC, the  decimal  system existed in China since the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC). [ 307 ]  The earliest evidence of a decimal  fraction , where the fraction's  denominator  is a  power  of ten, appears on an inscription of a standard measure of volume used by the mathematician and astronomer  Liu Xin  (c. 46 BC23 AD), dated precisely 5 AD. [ 214 ]  The first significant piece of Chinese literature to feature decimal fractions was the  The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art . [ 308 ]  This text was first mentioned in 179 AD, [ 309 ]  although  Liu Hui  (fl. 3rd century AD) asserts that some of its material predates the  infamous Qin book burning in 213 BC  (i.e. older than the oldest surviving Chinese mathematical treatise, the  Book on Numbers and Computation , 202186 BC). [ 310 ]  Liu Hui used decimal fractions with measurements and as solutions to  equations . [ 308 ]  At first decimal fractions were written in word form, since it was Han Yan (fl. late 8th century) of the  Tang Dynasty  (607907) who first used modern decimal notation to write out decimal fractions. [ 308 ]  Decimal fractions were vital to the work of  Song  (9601279) mathematicians such as  Yang Hui  (12381298) and  Qin Jiushao  (c. 12011261). [ 308 ]   Jamshd al-Ksh  (13801429), director of the astronomical observatory at  Samarkand , adopted the use of decimal fractions; they were first mentioned in  Europe  by  Christoff Rudolff  of  Augsburg  in his  Exempel-Buechlin  of 1530, yet not given serious attention until the 1585 work of the  Flemish  mathematician  Simon Stevin  (15481620). [ 308 ]   Deficiency diseases, correction by proper diet : As early as the 4th century BC,  Warring States Period  (403221 BC), records indicate that  Imperial Dieticians  were appointed at royal courts. [ 215 ]  The first explicit description of a regulated diet used to curb certain diseases is found in the  Systematic Treasury of Medicine  written by  Zhang Zhongjing  (c. 150c. 219) during the late  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD). [ 215 ]  Although Zhang did not understand the true nature of  vitamins , he prescribed foods now known to be rich in certain vitamins, which were discovered to be useful after much trial and error. [ 215 ]  The  Tang Dynasty  (618907) official and poet  Han Yu  (768824) observed that the deficiency disease  beriberi  (caused by lack of  Vitamin B 1 ) was far more prevalent south of the  Yangzi River  than north of it, an observation confirmed in the 20th century. [ 215 ]  The  Yuan Dynasty  (12711368) physician and Imperial Dietician  Hu Sihui  (fl. 13141330) published his book  Principles of Correct Diet  which compiled a large amount of previous material written on the subject. [ 215 ]  In it, Hu identified the two types of beriberi (today known as ""wet"" and ""dry"" types) and prescribed remedies of diets rich in Vitamin B 1  and other vitamins. [ 215 ]  Later,  Christiaan Eijkman  (19581930) was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine  in 1929 for discovering that beriberi was caused by a poor diet lacking the essential Vitamin B 1 .   Diabetes, recognition and treatment of : In ancient China, diabetes was aptly called 'dissolutive thirst' due to diabetic patients' excessive thirst and passing of urine. [ 311 ]  The  Huangdi Neijing  compiled by the 2nd century BC during the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) identified diabetes as a disease suffered by those who had made an excessive habit of eating sweet and fatty foods, while the  Old and New Tried and Tested Perscriptions  written by the  Tang Dynasty  (618907) physician Zhen Quan (died 643) was the first known book to mention an excess of  sugar  in the  urine  of diabetic patients. [ 311 ] [ 312 ]  While his book is now lost, quotations of it were preserved in the  Important Medical Formulae and Prescriptions Now Revealed by the Governor of a Distant Province , written by Wang Tao in 752. [ 311 ]  The Tang physician  Sun Simiao  (581682) wrote in his  Thousand Golden Remedies  of 655 that for diabetic patients ""three things must be renounced, wine, sex, and eating salted, starchy cereal products; if this regimen can be observed, cure may follow without drugs."" [ 313 ]  Robert Temple writes that this is similar to the modern method of avoiding alcohol and  starchy  foods. [ 313 ]  The sweetness of urine in diabetic patients is also noted in an ancient text of  India , but unlike the Chinese texts its date is ambiguous. [ 313 ]  Sweetness in urine of diabetic patients was discovered in  Europe  by  Thomas Willis  (16211675) around 1660 and published in 1679, yet this was not associated with sugar until 1776 in a work by Matthew Dobson; in 1815 this sugar was finally specified as  glucose . [ 313 ]   Dominoes, Chinese : The  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) author Xie Zhaozhe (15671624) initiated the legend that  dominoes  were first presented to the imperial court in 1112. [ 216 ]  However, the oldest confirmed written mention of dominoes in China comes from the  Former Events in Wulin  (i.e. the capital  Hangzhou ) written by the  Yuan Dynasty  (12711368) author Zhou Mi (12321298), who listed "" pupai "" (gambling plaques or dominoes) as well as  dice  as items sold by peddlers during the reign of  Emperor Xiaozong of Song  (r. 11621189). [ 216 ]  Andrew Lo asserts that Zhou Mi meant dominoes when referring to  pupai , since the Ming author Lu Rong (14361494) explicitly defined  pupai  as dominoes (in regards to a story of a suitor who won a maiden's hand by drawing out four winning  pupai  from a set). [ 216 ]  The earliest known manual written about dominoes is the  Manual of the Xuanhe Period  (11191125) written by Qu You (13471433). [ 216 ]  In the  Encyclopedia of a Myriad of Treasures , Zhang Pu (16021641) described the game of laying out dominoes as  pupai , although the character for  pu  had changed (yet retained the same pronunciation). [ 216 ]  Traditional Chinese domino games include  Tien Gow ,  Pai Gow ,  Che Deng , and others. It should be noted that the thirty-two-piece Chinese domino set (made to represent each possible face of two thrown dice and thus have no blank faces) differs from the twenty-eight-piece domino set found in  in the West  during the mid 18th century (in  France  and  Italy ). [ 314 ]   Dougong : A  dougong  is a  building bracket  which is unique to  Chinese architecture . Since at least the  Western Zhou Dynasty  (c. 1050771 BC), they were placed between the top of a column and a crossbeam to support the concave roofs of beam-in-tier buildings which were archetypal of Chinese architecture. [ 315 ]  Each dougong is formed by double bow-shaped arms (,  gong ) supported by a wooden block (,  dou ) on each side. [ 315 ]   Dougong  were also used for decorative and ceremonial rather than entirely pragmatic purposes of support, such as on solid brick  pagodas  like the  Iron Pagoda  built in 1049. The  Yingzao Fashi  building manual published in 1103 by the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) official Li Jie  featured illustrations and descriptions of  dougong . [ 316 ]   Drawloom : The earliest confirmed drawloom fabrics come from the  State of Chu  and date circa 400 BC. [ 317 ]  Most scholars attribute the invention of the drawloom to the ancient Chinese, although some speculate an independent invention from ancient  Syria  since drawloom fabrics found in  Dura-Europas  are thought to date before 256 AD. [ 317 ] [ 318 ]  Dieter Kuhn states that an analysis of texts and textiles from the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) proves that the figured fabrics of that era were also crafted with the use of a drawloom. [ 319 ]  The drawloom was certainly known in  Persia  by the 6th century AD. [ 317 ]  Eric Broudy asserts there is virtually no evidence of its use in  Europe  until the 17th century, while the button drawloom was allegedly invented by Jean le Calabrais in the 15th century. [ 320 ]  Mary Carolyn Beaudry disagrees, stating that it was used in the medieval  Italian  silk industry. [ 319 ]       [ edit ]   E     Eight-legged essay : The eight-legged essay was a style of  essay  that had to be mastered by candidates (for bureaucratic office) in the  civil service examinations . Its name derived from the eight sections it was divided by: an opening (), amplification (), preliminary exposition (), initial argument (), central argument (), latter argument (), final argument (), and conclusion (). It was introduced by  Wang Anshi  (10211086),  a chancellor  of the  Song Dynasty  (9601279), and was used by the  Ming  (13681644) and  Qing  (16441912) governments. [ 321 ]  In the examination, each candidate was required to write three essays of this type for the  Four Books  (of  Zhu Xi ) and four essays of this type for the  Five Classics  of antiquity. [ 322 ]   Endocrinology, isolation of sex and pituitary hormones from urine : A  group of leading scholars  under  Liu An  (179122 BC), a King of  Huainan  during the  Western Han  (202 BC9 AD), compiled the  Huainanzi  by 139 BC, which coined the phrase 'autumn minerals' for crystals similar to hoar-frost of autumn and that had ""white color and solidity."" [ 323 ]  In 25 BC, the minister Gu Yong gave a speech to the court railing against  magicians ,  Daoists , and  alchemists , saying of Daoists: ""from dark and muddy [that is, concentrated]  urine  they can make a hard white ice-like [crystalline] substance."" [ 323 ]  The  Tang Dynasty  (618907) poet  Bai Juyi  (722846) mentioned that his poet friend  Yuan Zhen  (779831) had prepared the 'autumn mineral' drug for his illness. [ 323 ]  The first explicit  recipe  for making the 'autumn mineral' is found in  Song Dynasty  (9601279) author Zhang Shengdao's  Valuable Tried and Tested Prescriptions  of 1025, with ten other recipes found in thirty-nine other books between then and 1833. [ 323 ]  The oldest recipe mentioned called for 568 liters (150 gallons) of male urine to be placed in a giant evaporating pan with an earthenware  still  mounted on the top. [ 323 ]  After heating, a dry, powdered residue could be obtained, which was then heated over a stove of charcoal to achieve  sublimation ; the product of this, only 85 g (3 oz), was ground into a powder, mixed with the skin of  palm dates , and made into pills the size of  mung beans . [ 323 ]  Another process published in 1110 specified the use of  gypsum  (containing  calcium sulfate ) as well as  saponin  from the beans of  Gleditschia sinensis  to extract hormones from urine, a process of using natural soaps which was not discovered elsewhere until the use of  digitonin  by  Adolf Windaus  (18761959) in 1909. [ 324 ]  In 1927,  Selmar Ascheim  (18781965) and  Bernhard Zondek  (18911966) discovered that urine of  pregnant women  had a high concentration of  steriod sex hormones ; a subsequent discovery was made that urine contained sex hormones of  androgens  and  estrogens , as well as the  pituitary  hormone  gonadotrophin . [ 323 ]  In modern medicine, the extraction of these hormones from urine is a standard practice, yet centuries before this the Chinese had used it to treat  hypogonadism ,  impotence ,  spermatorrhea ,  dysmenorrhea ,  leukorrhea , and even stimulating the growth of  beards  (since they knew that  castration  resulted in the loss of ability to grow a beard). [ 325 ]   Equal temperament : During the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD), the  music theorist  and mathematician  Jing Fang  (7837 BC) extended  the 12 tones  found in the 2nd century BC  Huainanzi  to 60. [ 326 ]  While generating his 60-divisional tuning, he discovered that 53  just fifths  is approximate to 31  octaves , calculating the difference at  ; this was the exact same value for  53 equal temperament  calculated by the  German  mathematician  Nicholas Mercator  (c. 16201687) as 3 53 /2 84 , a value known as Mercator's Comma. [ 327 ] [ 328 ]  The  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) music theorist  Zhu Zaiyu  (15361611) elaborated in three separate works beginning in 1584 the tuning system of equal temperament; in an unusual event in music theory's history, the  Flemish  mathematician  Simon Stevin  (15481620) discovered the mathematical formula for equal temperament at roughly the same time (within 1 to 25 years of Zhu), yet he did not publish his work and it remained unknown until 1884; therefore, it is debatable who discovered equal temperament first, Zhu or Stevin. [ 329 ] [ 330 ] [ 331 ]  In order to obtain  equal intervals , Zhu divided the octave (each octave with a ratio of 1:2, which can also be expressed as 1:2 12/12 ) into twelve equal  semitones  while each length was divided by the 12th root of 2. [ 332 ]  He did not simply divide the string into twelve equal parts (i.e. 11/12, 10/12, 9/12, etc.) since this would give unequal temperament; instead, he altered the ratio of each semitone by an equal amount (i.e. 1:2  11/12 , 1:2 10/12 , 1:2 9/12 , etc.) and determined the exact length of the string by dividing it by  12  2  (same as 2 1/12 ). [ 332 ]  The  Harmonie Universelle  (1636) written by  Marin Mersenne  (15881648) was the first publication in Europe outlining equal temperament, a new system of tuning that was passionately defended by  J.S. Bach  (16851750) in his  Well-Tempered Clavier  of 1722. [ 331 ]   Escapement : An escapement mechanism was first developed by the Buddhist monk, court astronomer, mathematician and engineer  Yi Xing  (683727) of the  Tang Dynasty  (618907) for his water-powered celestial globe in the tradition of  Zhang Heng  (78139), and could be found in later Chinese clockworks such as the  clock towers  of both  Zhang Sixun  (fl. late 10th century) and  Su Song  (10201101). [ 333 ] [ 334 ] [ 335 ] [ 176 ] [ 250 ] [ 336 ]  Yi Xing's escapement allowed for a bell to be rung automatically every hour, and a drum beaten automatically every quarter hour, essentially a  striking clock . [ 337 ]  Unlike the modern escapement which employs a suspended oscillating  pendulum  resting and releasing its hooks on a small rotating gear wheel, the early Chinese escapement employed the use of  gravity  and  hydraulics . [ 338 ]  In Su Song's clock tower, scoop containers fixed to the spokes of a vertical  waterwheel  (which acted like a gear wheel) would be filled one by one with siphoned water from a  clepsydra tank . [ 339 ]  When the weight of the water in the scoop filled to an excess, it overcame a counterweight that in turn tripped a lever allowing the scoop to rotate on a pivot and drain its water. [ 339 ]  However, as the scoop fell, it tripped a coupling tongue that temporarily pulled down on a long vertical chain, the latter yanking down on a balancing lever which would pull upward on a small chain connected to a locking arm, the latter lifting momentarily to release the top arrested spoke before coming back down to repeat the entire process over again. [ 339 ]  It should be pointed out that the Chinese intermittently working liquid-driven escapement had ""only the name in common"" with the true mechanical escapement of later medieval mechanical clocks which worked instead with weights, producing continuous but discrete beats. [ 340 ] [ 341 ]   Exploding cannonballs : The  Huolongjing  military manual compiled by  Jiao Yu  (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and  Liu Ji  (13111375) in the mid 14th century described the earliest known exploding cannonballs, which were made of cast iron with a hollow core packed with gunpowder; Jiao and Liu wrote that when fired, they could set enemy camps ablaze; the earliest evidence for exploding cannonballs in Europe date to the 16th century. [ 342 ] [ 343 ]  The  Huolongjing  also specified the use of 'blinding' and 'poison' gunpowder filled into exploding shells; the effects of this  chemical warfare  was described as such: ""Enemy soldiers will get their faces and eyes burnt, and the smoke will attack their noses, mouths, and eyes."" [ 252 ]       [ edit ]   F          The  field mill  in the Chinese book  Yuanxi Qiqi Tushuo Luzui  (""Collected Diagrams and Explanations of the Wonderful Machines of the Far West""), by  Johann Schreck  and Wang Zheng, published 1627         Field mill (carriage) : In the  Yezhongji  ('Record of Affairs at the Capital Ye of the Later Zhao Dynasty') written by Lu Hui (fl. 350 AD), various mechanical devices are described which were invented by two  Later Zhao  (319351) engineers known as Xie Fei, a Palace Officer, and Wei Mengbian, the Director of the Imperial Workshops. [ 344 ]  One of these is the field mill, which was essentially a cart with  millstones  placed onto the frame; these were mechanically rotated by the movement of the cart's terrain wheels in order to grind wheat and other cereal crops. [ 345 ]  A similar vehicle these two invented was the ""pounding cart"", which had wooden statues mounted on the top which were actually mechanical figures who operated real  tilt hammers  in order to  hull  rice; again, the device only functioned when the cart was moved forward and the wheels turned. [ 345 ]  The field mill lost its use in China sometime after the Later Zhao, but it was invented separately in  Europe  in 1580 by the  Italian  military engineer Pompeo Targone. [ 346 ]  It was featured in a treatise by Vittorio Zonca in 1607, and then in a Chinese book of 1627 (concerning  Western  technology) that was compiled and translated by the  German   Jesuit   Johann Schreck  (15761630) and the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) Chinese author Wang Zheng (15711644), although by then it was considered by the Chinese to be an original Western contraption. [ 347 ]   Finery forge : In addition to accidental lumps of low-carbon  wrought iron  produced by excessive injected air in Chinese  cupola furnaces , the ancient Chinese also created wrought iron by using the finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of  cast  and  pig iron  fined into wrought iron and  steel  found at the early  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) site at Tieshengguo. [ 348 ]  Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous  Warring States Period  (403221 BC), due to the fact that there are wrought iron items from China dating to that period and there is no documented evidence of the  bloomery  ever being used in China. [ 349 ]  The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and  removing carbon  from the molten cast iron through  oxidation . [ 348 ]  Wagner writes that in addition to the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining hearth from a  Shandong  tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text  Taiping Jing . [ 350 ]  Both Wagner and Pigott write that the fining hearth was a key feature of traditional Chinese iron smelting in recent centuries. [ 348 ] [ 351 ]            Local man setting off  fireworks  during  Chinese New Year  in  Shanghai ; the Chinese have used fireworks for entertainment since at least the  Song Dynasty  (9601279), coinciding with the use of  gunpowder  weapons              ""Angler on a Wintry Lake,"" painted in 1195 by  Ma Yuan , featuring the oldest known depiction of a  fishing reel , although the oldest description of a fishing reel in China dates to the 3rd century AD              Chinese  flamethrower  from the  Wujing Zongyao  manuscript of 1044,  Song Dynasty              By the 13th century, the Chinese used the  blow-fly  as an agent to solve murder cases in early  forensic entomology               Sheng player  Guo Yi beside the River Thames, London, England.

[ 352 ]              The  Chinese game  of  majiang  (), commonly referred to as  mahjong  in  English , has been played since at least the 19th century and has its roots in earlier Chinese  card games              Engineer  Otto Lilienthal  on a  hang glider  in Germany in 1891; the earliest confirmed account of manned flight with kites comes from China during the mid 6th century AD.

[ 353 ] [ 354 ]              A restaurant  menu  from Hong Kong; the first menus appeared in China during the  Song Dynasty  (9601279).              The 'flying crow with magic fire' winged rocket bomb from the  Huolongjing , mid 14th century, compiled by  Liu Ji  and  Jiao Yu              A  Song Dynasty  painting on silk of two  Chinese cargo ships  accompanied by  a smaller boat ; notice the large stern-mounted  rudder  on the ship shown in the foreground         Fire lance : The fire lance was a proto-gun developed in the 10th century with a tube of first bamboo and later on metal that shot a weak  gunpowder  blast of flame and shrapnel; its earliest representation comes from  a painting found  at  Dunhuang . [ 355 ] [ 356 ] [ 357 ]   Fireworks : Fireworks first appeared in China during the  Song Dynasty  (9601279), in the early age of  gunpowder . The common people in the Song era could purchase simple fireworks from market vendors; these were made of sticks of  bamboo  packed with gunpowder, [ 358 ]  although grander displays were known to be held. In 1110, a large fireworks display in a martial demonstration was held to entertain  Emperor Huizong  (r. 11001125) and his court, accompanied by dancers moving through colored smoke. [ 359 ]  In 1264, Empress Dowager Gong Sheng became frightened during a feast held in her honor (by her son  Emperor Lizong ) when a fast rocket-propelled ""ground rat"" was lit off. [ 360 ]  Rocket propulsion was soon applied to warfare, and by the time of the mid 14th century there were many types of rocket launchers available. [ 361 ]   Fishing reel : In literary records, the earliest evidence of the fishing reel comes from a 4th century AD [ 362 ] [ 363 ]  work entitled  Lives of Famous Immortals . [ 364 ] [ 365 ]  The earliest known depiction of a fishing reel comes from a  Southern Song  (11271279) painting done in 1195 by  Ma Yuan  (c. 11601225) called ""Angler on a Wintry Lake,"" showing a man sitting on a small  sampan  boat while casting out his  fishing line . [ 366 ]  Another fishing reel was featured in a painting by  Wu Zhen  (12801354). [ 366 ]  The book  Tianzhu lingqian  (Holy Lections from Indian Sources), printed sometime between 1208 and 1224, features two different  woodblock print illustrations  of fishing reels being used. [ 366 ]  An  Armenian  parchment Gospel of the 13th century shows a reel (though not as clearly depicted as the Chinese ones). [ 366 ]  The  Sancai Tuhui , a  Chinese encyclopedia  published in 1609, features the next known picture of a fishing reel and vividly shows the  windlass  pulley of the device. [ 366 ]  These five pictures mentioned are the only ones which feature fishing reels before the year 1651 (when the first  English  illustration was made); after that year they became commonly depicted in world art. [ 366 ]   Flamethrower, double piston : Although the single piston flamethrower was first developed in the  Byzantine Empire  during the 7th century, [ 367 ]  the 10th century Chinese flamethrower, or  Pen Huo Qi , boasted a continuous stream of flame by employing double  piston   syringes  (which had been known since the  Han Dynasty ) spouting  Greek fire  which had been imported from China's maritime trade contacts in the Middle East; its first description came in 919, its first use in battle in 932 during the  Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period  (907960), and its first drawn illustration found in the early  Song Dynasty  (9601279) military manuscript  Wujing Zongyao  of 1044, which also described the device in full. [ 368 ] [ 369 ]   Flare, military signalling : The earliest recorded use of a flare for signalling purposes was the 'signal bomb' used by the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) Chinese as the  Mongol -led  Yuan Dynasty  (12711368) besieged  Yangzhou  in 1276. [ 370 ]  These soft-shelled bombs, timed to explode in mid-air and perhaps producing a vibrant colored burst like contemporary Chinese  fireworks  produced, were used to send messages to a detachment of troops far in the distance. [ 370 ]   Forensic entomology, utilization to solve crimes : The  Song Dynasty  (9601279)  forensic science  work  Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified  published by  Song Ci  in 1247 contains the oldest known case of forensic entomology. [ 371 ]  In a murder case of 1235, a villager was stabbed to death and authorities determined that his wounds were inflicted by a  sickle ; this was a tool used for cutting rice at harvest time, a fact which led them to suspect a fellow peasant worker was involved. [ 371 ]  The local magistrate had the villagers assemble in the town square where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles. [ 371 ]  Within minutes, a mass of  blow flies  gathered around one sickle and none other, attracted to the scent of traces of  blood  unseen by the naked eye. [ 371 ]  It became apparent to all that the owner of that sickle was the culprit, the latter pleading for mercy as he was detained by authorities. [ 371 ]   Free reed aerophone : The musical  pipe organ  employing metal  piston   bellows  had a long history  in the West . [ 372 ]  It was an invention of the  Hellenic Alexandrians  and was  described in minute detail  by the  Roman  engineer  Vitruvius  in the late 1st century BC, although it is now more commonly associated with the  Christian liturgy . [ 372 ]  However, the Western pipe organ did not make use of  the reed , which the ancient Chinese  mouth organ  employed. [ 372 ]  The latter instrument, called a  sheng  and made traditionally of  bamboo  pipes, was first mentioned in the  Shi Jing  of the  Zhou Dynasty  (c. 1050256 BC). [ 372 ]  The Chinese sheng is considered the ancestor of the  harmonica ,  harmonium ,  concertina ,  accordion , and  all other reed organ instruments . [ 372 ]  A free  reed organ  was invented in the  Arab world  in the 13th century, while the German  Heinrich Traxdorf  (fl. 15th century) of  Nuremberg  built one around 1460 AD. [ 373 ]  It is thought that the classical Chinese sheng travelled west through  Russia  during the 19th century, as it was described then in  Saint Petersburg . [ 372 ]       [ edit ]   G     Gas cylinder : From deep  boreholes  drilled during the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD), the Chinese had used  bamboo pipelines  to transport  natural gas  to  stoves  where  cast iron  pans were used to boil  brine  and extract  salt . [ 374 ]  A  gazetteer  written before the 10th century during the  Tang Dynasty  (618907) stated that a 'fire well' of Linqiong in what is now  Sichuan  reached depths of 182 m (600 ft) and spouted flames at the top. [ 375 ]  It stated that people used the gas from this 'fire well' to fill portable tubes which could be carried around over a hundred  li  (dozens of km or mi) and still be lit at the end to produce a flame. [ 375 ]  Robert Temple assumes that  some sort of tap  was used for this. [ 376 ]  A 17th or 18th century gazetteer from the  Qing Dynasty  (16441912) states that a leather bag could be filled with natural gas, punctured with a tiny hole, touched by fire, and instantly give heat and light. [ 377 ]  A  Song Dynasty  (9601279) book of 980 also records the use of  petroleum  (which the Chinese called ""stone lacquer"") in portable bamboo tubes which could be used for lighting at night ""in the same manner as ordinary people carry torches."" [ 376 ]  A 16th century book from the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) also states that petroleum was used as fuel in  lamps  which could substitute for  candles . [ 376 ]   Gaussian elimination : First published  in the West  by  Carl Friedrich Gauss  (17771855) in 1826, the algorithm for  solving linear equations  known as Gaussian elimination is named after this  Hanoverian  mathematician, yet it was first expressed as the Array Rule in the Chinese  Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art , written at least by 179 AD during the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) and commented on by the 3rd century mathematician  Liu Hui . [ 378 ] [ 379 ] [ 380 ]   Gimbal ('Cardan' suspension) : The gimbal is known as the 'Cardan' suspension after  Gerolamo Cardano  (15011576), yet it was known long before him. [ 381 ]   Joseph Needham  writes that the earliest confirmed use of gimbals in Europe is the 9th century  recipe  book  Little Key of Painting  ( Latin :  Mappae Clavicula ), which mentioned a vase surrounded by rings which allowed it to be undisturbed when in a rolling motion. [ 382 ]  Needham and  George Sarton  both write that an  Arabic  translationdated to roughly the era of  Al-Ma'mun  (r. 813833)of an  ancient Greek  work now lost (i.e.  Pneumatica ) by  Philo of Byzantium  (c. 280c. 220 BC) contains a description of gimbals used to support an inkpot that could wet a pen on any of its sides, yet Needham suspects Arabic  interpolation  and doubts total authenticity, while Sarton asserts that for the most part the Arabic translation is faithful to Philo's lost original, hence Philo should be credited with the invention of the gimbal. [ 383 ] [ 384 ]  Around 180 AD, the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) inventor  Ding Huan  ()who also created a  rotary fan  and  zoetrope  lampinvented a 'Perfume Burner for use among Cushions', or 'Bedclothes Censer'. [ 385 ]  This  incense burner  had a series of metal rings which could be moved in any direction while the burner in the middle remained constantly level. [ 385 ]  This is the first clear reference in China of the gimbal, although there is a hint in the writing of  Sima Xiangru  (179117 BC) that this device existed in the 2nd century BC (i.e., 'the metal rings burning perfume'). [ 386 ]  The gimbal incense burner is mentioned in subsequent dynasties, while silverwork specimens of gimbal incense burners from the  Tang Dynasty  (618907) still exist. [ 387 ]  In the  Liang Dynasty  (502557) there is mention of gimbals used in hinges for doors and windows, while an unnamed artisan presented a warming  stove  to  Wu Zetian  (r. 690705) in 692 which employed gimbals to keep it constantly balanced. [ 388 ]   Go (board game) : Although ancient Chinese legend (perhaps contrived during the  Han Dynasty ) has it that the  mythological ruler Yao  came down to earth  from the Heavens  around 2200 BC carrying with him a  go  board and stone player's pieces, it is known from existing literature that the  go  board game existed since at least the 10th century BC during the  Zhou Dynasty  (c. 1050256 BC) and was even mentioned in writing by the philosophers  Confucius  (551479 BC) and  Mencius  (371289 BC), although the latter two had a slightly negative opinion of it. [ 389 ] [ 390 ]   Guqin : The  guqin  is one of the oldest stringed  zither  instruments from China and has existed since at least the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600c. 1050 BC), as a Shang  oracle bone  contains  the oldest known inscription  of the Chinese character for  qin  () . [ 391 ]  The oldest example of a guqin comes from the  tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng  (433 BC);  Bo Lawergren  argues they may have developed from Middle Eastern  harps  like  konghou , which was also found in  Qiemo ,  Xinjiang  dating to 400200 BC. [ 392 ]  It was said to be popular in the  Zhou Dynasty  (c. 1050256 BC), while the oldest known written  tablature  for the  guqin  dates to the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD). [ 391 ]  The  guqin  became a musical instrument highly associated with  China's gentry class  when it was exalted as one of the  Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar  as well as one of the gentry's ""nine guests"" described by  Shen Kuo  (10311095); [ 393 ]  it was even featured in painted artwork,  such as in a 12th century piece by Emperor Huizong himself .       [ edit ]   H     Hand cannon : The earliest metal-barrel hand cannons dating to the 13th century are attested to by archaeological evidence from a  Heilongjiang  excavation as well as written evidence in the  Yuanshi  (1370) concerning Li Tang, an  ethnic Jurchen  commander under the  Yuan Dynasty  (12711368) who in 1288 suppressed the rebellion of the Christian prince Nayan with his ""gun-soldiers"" or  chongzu , this being the earliest known event where this phrase was used. [ 394 ] [ 395 ]  The bronze Yuan Dynasty gun from Heilongjiang which dates to about 1288 is a little over 0.3 m (1 ft) in length and weighs 3.6 kg (8 lbs). [ 395 ]  It has a small  touch hole  for ignition and an even bore except for the bulbous enlargement around the explosion chamber, a design which allowed the weapon to brace the force of the internal explosion. [ 395 ]   Heavy moldboard iron plow : Although use of the simple  wooden ard  in China must have preceded it, the earliest discovered Chinese iron plows date to roughly 500 BC, during the  Zhou Dynasty  (1122256 BC) and were flat, V-shaped, and mounted on wooden poles and handles. [ 396 ] [ 397 ]  By the 3rd century BC, improved iron casting techniques led to the development of the heavy moldboard plow, seen in  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) artwork such as tomb carved bricks. [ 396 ]  The moldboard allowed the Chinese to turn farm soil without clogging the  plowshare  with dirt, which was flung off the wheelbarrow via slanted wings on both sides. [ 398 ]  While the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC) were made mostly of perishable wood except for the iron blade, the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Han Dynasty were made entirely of solid iron with the moldboard attached to the top to turn the soil. [ 399 ]   Horner scheme : Although named after  English  mathematician  William George Horner  (17861837), the Horner scheme, an  algorithm  used to estimate the root of an equation and evaluate  polynomials  in  monomial form , was actually first invented in China to find the  cube root  of the number 1,860,867 (the answer given being 123). [ 400 ]  This is found in the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) work  The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art , commented on by  Liu Hui  (fl. 3rd century) in 263 AD. [ 400 ]  The original  Nine Chapters  found the root of equations through continued fractions, just like the later  Italian  mathematician  Joseph Louis Lagrange  (17361813), while Liu Hui achieved this by increasing  decimals , just like William George Horner in his work of 1819. [ 400 ]   Horse collar : A significant improvement of the  ancient breast harness  was the horse collar. Robert Temple speculates that a  Han Dynasty  brick from the 1st century BC shows the first depiction of a horse collar. [ 401 ]  It was certainly depicted in a  Northern Wei  (386534) mural at  Dunhuang , China, dated 477499; the latter artwork does not feature the essential collar cushion behind the cross bar, though, while a later  Tang Dynasty  (618907) mural of about 851 AD accurately displays the cushioned collar behind the cross bar. [ 402 ] [ 403 ]  It should be noted that an earlier painting of the  Sui Dynasty  (581618) accurately depicted the horse collar as it is seen today, yet the illustration shows its use on a  camel  instead of a horse. [ 404 ]   Horse harness, (""trace"" or ""breast"") : Throughout the ancient world, the 'throat-and-girth' harness was used for harnessing horses that pulled  carts ; this greatly limited a horse's ability to exert itself as it was constantly choked at the neck. [ 405 ] [ 406 ]  A painting on a  lacquerware  box from the  State of Chu , dated to the 4th century BC, shows the first known use of a yoke placed across a horses's chest, with traces connecting to the chariot shaft. [ 407 ] [ 408 ]  The hard yoke across the horse's chest was gradually replaced by a breast strap, which was often depicted in carved reliefs and stamped bricks of tombs from the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD). [ 409 ]  Eventually, the  horse collar  was invented in China, at least by the 5th century. [ 402 ] [ 410 ]   Hybrid rice : A team of agricultural scientists headed by  Yuan Longping  (b. 1930) developed a new type of rice called hybrid rice in 1973 which allows for roughly 12,000 kg (26,450 lbs) of rice to be grown per hectare (10,000 m 2 ). [ 162 ]  Hybrid rice has proven to be greatly beneficial in areas where there is little arable land, and has been adopted by several Asian and African countries. [ 162 ]       [ edit ]   I     India ink : Although named after  carbonaceous  pigment materials originating from  India , Indian ink first appeared in China; some scholars say it was made as far back as the 3rd millennium BC, while others state it was perhaps not invented until the  Wei Dynasty  (220265 AD). [ 411 ] [ 412 ] [ 413 ] [ 414 ]  Although early ink mixtures contained the  soot  of  pine , the scholar-official  Shen Kuo  (10311095) was the first to create an India ink from the soot of  petroleum , which  Li Shizhen  (15181593) later wrote was lustrous like  lacquer  and superior to ink made from pine soot. [ 415 ] [ 416 ] [ 417 ] [ 418 ]   Inoculation, treatment of smallpox : Joseph Needham and Robert Temple state that a case of inoculation for smallpox may have existed in the late 10th century during the  Song Dynasty  (9601279), yet they rely on a book  Zhongdou xinfa  () written in 1808 by Zhu Yiliang for this evidence. [ 419 ] [ 420 ]  Wan Quan (14991582) wrote the first clear reference to smallpox inoculation in his  Douzhen xinfa  () of 1549. [ 421 ]  The process of inoculation was also vividly described by Yu Chang in his  Yuyi cao  (), or  Notes on My Judgment  published in 1643, and Zhang Yan in his  Zhongdou xinshu  (), or  New book on smallpox inoculation  in 1741. [ 422 ]  As written by Yu Tianchi in his  Shadou jijie  () of 1727, which was based on Wang Zhangren's  Douzhen jinjing lu  () of 1579, the technique of inoculation to avoid smallpox was not widespread in China until the reign of the  Longqing Emperor  (r. 1567 1572) during the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644). [ 423 ] [ 421 ]  The Chinese method was to avoid using smallpox material of those who had the full-blown disease (i.e.  Variola major ) due to the risk of transmitting it; instead they used a cotton plug inserted into the nose of an already inoculated person with minor scabbing (i.e.  Variola minor ) to obtain their material. [ 419 ]  Once someone's  body builds up an immunity  to the minor case of smallpox, that person will never contract the disease again. [ 424 ]       [ edit ]   J     Jacob's staff : The  Song Dynasty  (9601279) official  Shen Kuo  (10311095), an  antiquarian  who pursued studies of  archaeological  finds, unearthed an ancient crossbow-like mechanism from a garden in  Jiangsu  which had on its stock a graduated sighting scale in minute measurements. [ 159 ]  He wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. [ 159 ]  He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated. [ 159 ]  Shen wrote that this was similar to mathematicians who used right-angled triangles to measure height. [ 159 ]  Joseph Needham writes that what Shen had discovered was Jacob's staff, a  surveying  tool which was not known in Europe until the  Jewish  mathematician  Levi ben Gerson  (12881344) of  Provence ,  France  described it in 1321. [ 425 ]   Jade burial suit : Burial suits  made of jade  existed in China during the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD). Confirming ancient records about Han royalty and nobility buried in jade burial suits, archaeologists discovered in June 1968 the tombs and jade burial suits of Prince  Liu Sheng  (d. 113 BC) and his wife  Dou Wan  in Hebei province. [ 426 ]  Liu's suit, in twelve flexible sections, comprised 2,690 square pieces of green jade with holes punctured in the four corners of each piece so that they could be sewn together with gold thread. [ 427 ]  The total weight of the gold thread used in his suit was 1,110 g (39 oz). [ 428 ]  Princess Dou Wan's suit had 2,156 pieces of jade stitched together with 703 g (24.7 oz) of gold thread. [ 428 ]  Although jade burial outer wears and head masks appear in tombs of the early Han Dynasty, burial suits did not appear until the reign of  Emperor Wen of Han  (r. 180157 BC), with the earliest being found in the  Shizishan  site. A total of 22 Western Han (202 BC9 AD) and 27 Eastern Han (25220 AD) complete and partial jade burial suits were uncovered between 1954 and 1996. They are found mainly in  Hebei ,  Shandong ,  Jiangsu  and  Henan , as well as at  Yangjiawan ,  Dongyuan ,  Guangzhou ,  Mawangdui ,  Mianyang  and  Shizhaishan . The jade burial suit gradually disappeared when it was forbidden in 222 by  Emperor Wen of Wei . [ 429 ]   Junk (ship) : The Chinese  junk , derived from the  Portuguese  term  junco  (which in turn was adapted from the  Javanese   djong  meaning ""ship""), [ 430 ]  was a ship design unique to China, although many other ship types in China (such as the towered  lou chuan ) preceded it. [ 431 ] [ 432 ]  Its origins could be seen in the latter half of the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD), when ship designs began to have square-ended  bows  and  sterns  with flat bottom  hulls . [ 433 ]  Unlike the earliest shipbuilding traditions of the  Western world  and  South Asia , the junk had a (flat or slightly rounded)  carvel-shaped hull  which lacked a  keel  and  sternpost  (necessitating  block and tackle  or socket-and-jaw attachment of the Chinese  rudder ). [ 434 ]  Since there is no keel in the design,  solid transverse bulkheads  take the place of structural ribs. [ 435 ]  As written by Wan Zhen (fl. 3rd century AD) in his  Strange Things of the South,  by his day the junk employed  for-and-aft rigs  with  lug sails , while the larger four-masted vessels could carry up to 700 people as well as 235,868 kg (260 t) of cargo. [ 436 ]       [ edit ]   K     Kite : As written in the  Mozi , the philosopher, artisan, and engineer  Lu Ban  (fl. 5th century BC) from the  State of Lu  created a wooden bird that remained flying in the air for three days, essentially a kite; there is written evidence that kites were used as rescue signals when the city of  Nanjing  was besieged by  Hou Jing  (died 552) during the reign of  Emperor Wu of Liang  (r. 502549), while similar accounts of kites used for military signalling are found in the  Tang  (618907) and  Jin  (11151234) dynasties; kite flying as a pastime can be seen in painted murals of  Dunhuang  dating to the  Northern Wei  (386534) period, while descriptions of flying kites as a pastime have been found in  Song  (9601279) and  Ming  (13681644) texts. [ 437 ] [ 438 ]       [ edit ]   L     Land mine : Textual evidence suggests that the first use of a land mine in history was by a  Song Dynasty  (9601279) brigadier general known as Lou Qianxia, who used an 'enormous bomb' ( huo pao ) to kill intruding  Mongol soldiers  invading  Guangxi  in 1277. [ 439 ]  However, the first detailed description of the land mine was given in the  Huolongjing  text written by  Jiao Yu  (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and  Liu Ji  (13111375) during the late  Yuan Dynasty  (12711368) and early  Ming Dynasty  (13681644). [ 440 ]  Jiao and Liu wrote that land mines were spherical, made of  cast iron , and their fuses ignited by a mechanism tripped by enemy movement; although Jiao and Liu did not describe this trip mechanism in full detail, a later text of 1606 revealed that enemy movement released a pin that allowed hidden underground weights to fall and spin a chord around an axle that rotated a spinning wheel acting as a  flint  to spark a train of fuses. [ 441 ]   Leeboard : To avoid  leeward  drift caused by the force of wind while sailing, the leeboard was invented; it was essentially a board lowered onto the side of the ship opposite to the direction of the wind, helping the ship to stay upright and on course. [ 442 ]  Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that an odd-looking second paddle on  a bronze drum  of the  Dong Son culture  (centered in the  Red River Delta  of northern  Vietnam ) may depict a leeboard in use as early as 300 BC. [ 443 ]  Robert Temple points out that the first written evidence for the leeboard dates to 759 AD, found in the  Tang Dynasty  (618907 AD) book  Manual of the White and Gloomy Planet of War  by Li Quan. [ 444 ]  Li stated that boards for warships ""held the ships, so that even when wind and wave arise in fury, they are neither driven sideways, nor overturn."" [ 444 ]  Leeboards are featured shortly after in 9th century engraved artwork found at the  Borobudur  monument built during the  Sailendra  dynasty of  Central Java  ( Indonesia ). [ 443 ]  Leeboards were first used  in the West  by the  Dutch , sometime during the 15th to 16th centuries (possibly used on early Dutch  cogs , or perhaps influenced by a Chinese origin). [ 445 ] [ 446 ]   Liubo : The now defunct board game  liubo  for the most part remains an enigma for modern scholars still deciphering exactly how it was played; its association with both  gambling  and  divination  make it a unique game. [ 447 ] [ 448 ]  The earliest two  liubo  game boards are found in the  Zhongshan  Tomb 3 at  Shijiazhuang ,  Hebei . [ 449 ] [ 450 ]  Similar finds, dating from the mid 4th century BC, are also found in the  Chu  Tomb 197 and 314 at  Jiangling ,  Hubei . [ 449 ] [ 451 ]   Liubo  game boards have been found in several  Western Han  (202 BC9 AD) tombs; 1 wooden board at Jiangdu in  Jiangsu ; 1 wooden board in Tomb 8 at Fenghuangshan in Hubei; 1 lacquered set of  liubo  in Tomb 3 at  Mawangdui  in  Hunan ; 1 lacquered board in Tomb 1 at Dafentou in  Yunnan ; 1 bronze board at Xilin in  Guangxi . [ 452 ]  During the Han Dynasty, an argument over the divination portents of the game as a result of a playing session led to a fight between  a Western Han crown prince  and Liu Xian (), where the latter was killed in the scuffle which (in part) prompted his father Liu Pi (), the King of Wu, to rebel against central Han authority in the  Rebellion of the Seven States  (154 BC). [ 447 ]  The historian Michael Loewe asserts that the set pieces of  liubo  were symbolic of the forces of the Chinese Five Elements,  wu xing . [ 448 ]       [ edit ]   M     'Magic mirrors' : In about 800 AD, during the  Tang Dynasty  (618907), a book entitled  Record of Ancient Mirrors  described the method of crafting solid  bronze mirrors  with decorations, written characters, or patterns on the reverse side that could cast these in a reflection on a nearby surface as light struck the front, polished side of the mirror; due to this seemingly  transparent effect , they were called 'light-penetration mirrors' by the Chinese. [ 453 ]  Unfortunately, this Tang era book was lost over the centuries, but magic mirrors were described in the  Dream Pool Essays  by  Shen Kuo  (10311095), who owned three of them as a family  heirloom . [ 454 ]  Perplexed as to how solid metal could be transparent, Shen guessed that some sort of  quenching  technique was used to produce tiny wrinkles on the face of the mirror too small to be observed by the eye. [ 454 ]  Although his explanation of different cooling rates was incorrect, he was right to suggest the surface contained minute variations which the naked eye could not detect; these mirrors also had no transparent quality at all, as discovered by  William Bragg  in 1932 (after an entire century of them baffling Western scientists). [ 455 ]  Robert Temple describes their construction: ""The basic mirror shape, with the design on the back, was cast flat, and the convexity of the surface produced afterwards by elaborate scraping and scratching. The surface was then polished to become shiny. The stresses set up by these processes caused the thinner parts of the surface to bulge outwards and become more convex than the thicker portions. Finally, a  mercury  amalgam was laid over the surface; this created further stresses and preferential buckling. The result was that imperfections of the mirror surface matched the patterns on the back, although they were too minute to be seen by the eye. But when the mirror reflected bright sunlight against a wall, with the resultant magnification of the whole image, the effect was to reproduce the patterns  as if  they were passing through the solid bronze by way of light beams."" [ 454 ]   Maglev wind power generators : In 2006, a new type of  wind power  generator employing  magnetic levitation  (maglev) was showcased at the Wind Power Asia Exhibition in  Beijing . [ 456 ] [ 352 ]  Li Guokun was the chief scientific developer of the new maglev wind power generator, in collaboration with the Guangzhou Energy Research Institute under the  Chinese Academy of Sciences  and the Zhongke Hengyuan Energy Technology Company based in  Guangzhou . [ 456 ] [ 352 ]  Li Guokun states that traditional  wind turbines  need high wind speeds to start, due to friction caused by their bearings. [ 456 ] [ 352 ]  The new frictionless maglev wind generator requires wind speeds of only 1.5 m per second (or 5 km an hour) to start and are expected to cut operational costs for  wind farms  by half, i.e. overall cost of roughly 0.4  Chinese yuan  per  kilowatt hour . [ 456 ] [ 352 ]   Mahjong : Jelte Rep writes that the  gambling  game of mahjong ( Traditional Chinese : ;  Pinyin : mjing), which employs  a set of over a hundred tiles , was first invented in 1846 by Zhen Yumen, a  Qing Dynasty  (16441912) diplomatic official from  Ningbo . [ 457 ]  However, Rep traces the origins of the game to a  card game  of the  Tang Dynasty  (618907) which used thirty-two wood or ivory pieces in the shape of cards. [ 458 ]  This evolved into the forty-card game of  madiao  () during the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644), which had four  suits of cards  instead of the three found in modern mahjong. [ 458 ]   Manned flight with kites : Although  Ge Hong  (284364 AD) made a hint in his writing about manned flights using kites, the first solid proof dates to the  Northern Qi  (550577) era. [ 459 ]  An ancient Chinese tradition of piety called 'the liberation of living creatures', where fish and birds were released after capture, was corrupted by the notoriously cruel  Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi  (r. 550559). While executing the entire  Tuoba  family which had ruled the previous dynasty of  Eastern Wei  (534550), Emperor Wenxuan used the concept of 'the liberation of living creatures' when he launched Tuoba family members from the top of the 30 m (100 ft) tall Golden Phoenix Tower (near  Ye, China ) as test pilots for his manned flying kites. [ 459 ]  According to the account, Emperor Wenxuan first had the prisoners ""harnessed with great bamboo mats as wings, and ordered them to fly to the ground from the top of the tower;"" all of these men died. [ 460 ]  However, Wenxuan wanted a greater spectacle, and by the last year of his reign had the prisoners harnessed into large kites shaped as owls; the former Eastern Wei prince  Yuan Huangtou  (died 559) reportedly flew about 3.2 km (2 mi) before landing, yet was captured and handed over to Bi Yiyun, head official of the  censorate , who shortly after had him executed. [ 461 ]  Records of this account were preserved in the historical work  Zizhi Tongjian  compiled by Chancellor  Sima Guang  (10191086) in 1084. [ 461 ]  The later traveler  Marco Polo  (12541324) remarked that the crews of Chinese merchant ships always had a fool or drunkard who would be a candidate for being placed into a ""hurdle"" made of willow stems which was flown in the air by eight cords and used as a means of  fortune-telling  for commercial prospects. [ 462 ]   Map, economic :  A set of seven geographical maps  from the  State of Qin , dated to the 4th century BC during the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC), display a region centered around the  Jialing River . [ 463 ]  Mei-ling Hsu writes that since two of these maps feature labeled sites where timber was gathered and the  measured distances  between these timber sites, they can be viewed as economic maps. [ 464 ]  These predate the economic maps of the  Roman  geographer  Strabo  (c. 64 BCc. 24 AD). [ 464 ]   Map, oldest printed : As proven by archaeological excavation in China, the oldest known Chinese maps were made by  cartographers  of the  State of Qin  during the 4th century BC, [ 465 ]  yet maps were not printed for the first time until the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) encyclopedist Yang Jia included one in his printed encyclopedia of 1155 AD. [ 466 ]   Match, non-friction : The earliest type of match for lighting fire was made in China by 577 AD, invented by  Northern Qi  (550577) court ladies as they desperately looked for materials to light fires for cooking and heating as enemy troops of  Northern Zhou  (557581) and the  Chen Dynasty  (557589) besieged their city from outside. [ 467 ]  Early matches in China were made of pinewood sticks impregnated with  sulfur  and needed a slight touch of an already existing flame to light. [ 467 ]  This was written in the  Records of the Unwordly and Strange  by Tao Gu in 950 ( Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period ), who also wrote that they were once called ""light-bringing slaves"" before they were commercially marketed as the 'fire inch-stick'. [ 467 ]  The self-striking, friction match was not made until 1827, an invention of  John Walker .   Mechanical theater, carriage-driven : The inventors of the  field mill  mentioned above, Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian of the  Later Zhao  (319351 AD), also invented an intricate mechanical theater mounted on a carriage, its figures operated by motive power (i.e. simply advancing the carriage forward). [ 468 ]  From 335 to 345 AD, they worked at the court of the ethnic- Jie  emperor  Shi Hu  (334349). [ 468 ]  The vehicle they crafted was a four-wheeled and 6 m (20 ft) long carriage that was about 3 m (10 ft) wide. [ 468 ]  On it rested a large  golden Buddha statue  with a  Daoist  statue continually rubbing his front with his mechanical hand. [ 468 ]  The Buddha was also surrounded by ten wooden Daoists who rotated around him in a circuit, periodically bowing to him, saluting him, and throwing  incense  into a  censer . [ 468 ]  Above the Buddha were nine dragon-headed faucets which spouted water. [ 468 ]  Like the field mill and the pounding cart of these two inventors, when the carriage halted, so did all of its moving components of mechanical statues and spouting faucets. [ 469 ]   Mechanical cup-bearers and wine-pourers on automatic-traveling boats : The mechanical engineer Huang Gun served the court of  Emperor Yang of Sui  (r. 604617) and wrote the book  Shuishi Tujing  on his inventions, which his colleague Du Bao enlarged and commented on. [ 470 ]  He constructed seven small boats, called 'wine boats', that were as large as 3 m (10 ft) long and 1.8 m (6 ft) wide which supported a number of mechanical figures of wooden statues called 'hydraulic elegances', each about 0.6 m (2 ft) tall, some of them animals but most in human form consisting of singing girls, musicians playing actual instruments, dancers and tumblers, oarsmen busy rowing, cup-bearers, and wine-pourers all moving simultaneously as if alive. [ 470 ]  These boats were set to travel at timed intervals along circuits made of winding stone channels and canals in palace courtyards and gardens (designed by Tang Haogui), where guests would gather for special occasions. [ 470 ]  The cup-bearer stood at the bow of each ship and beside him the wine-pourer; when the ship made automatically-timed periodic stops where guests were seated, the cup-bearer automatically stretched out his arm with a full cup of wine. [ 470 ]  When the guest was done emptying his cup, he placed the cup back into the figure's hands; the latter then waited as the wine-pourer filled a second cup to be emptied. [ 470 ]  When this guest had been served, the wine boat automatically moved onwards to the next stop. [ 470 ]  Joseph Needham speculates that the 'wine boats' may have been  paddle-wheel-driven ; [ 471 ]  as Robert Temple notes, the paddle wheel ship was already known in China since the  Liu Song Dynasty  (420479). [ 472 ]  Aside from the partial remains of the  Shuishi Tujing , an account of these 'wine boats' was also preserved by Huang Gun's contemporary  Yan Shigu  (581645). [ 473 ]   Military strategy treatise : The earliest known book on  military strategy ,  The Art of War , was written by  Sun Wu  (c. 544496 BC), better known as Sunzi (""Master Sun""), during the 6th century BC. [ 474 ]  The earliest known reference to Sunzi was in the 2nd century BC text of the  Huainanzi  (compiled no later than 122 BC), [ 475 ]  while a biography of Sunzi was featured in  Sima Qian 's (c. 14586 BC)  Records of the Grand Historian  compiled from 109 to 91 BC. [ 476 ]  The  oldest known copy of Sunzi's  Art of War  (on bamboo strips) was found in a 1972 archaeological excavation at Mount Yinque (near  Linyi ,  Shandong ) of a  Western Han  (202 BC9 AD) tomb dated c. 140118 BC. [ 477 ]  The oldest version of another famous  Art of War  by Sunzi's descendant  Sun Bin  (d. 316 BC) was also found in the same tomb. [ 477 ]   Modular system of architecture, eight standard grades : Although other texts preceded it, such as the 'National Building Law' of the  Tang Dynasty  (618907) which was partially preserved in other texts, the  Yingzao Fashi  published in 1103 by the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) scholar-official  Li Jie  (10651110) is the oldest known Chinese architectural treatise that has survived fully intact. [ 478 ]  It contains descriptions and illustrations detailing the  cai fen  system () of eight standard dimensions for  module  components of timber architecture and structural  carpentry . [ 479 ]  The eight standard grades of module timber components in the  Yingzao Fashi , with grade  I  being the largest and grade  VIII  the smallest, were used to determine the ultimate proportions and scale of a building as a whole, as all timber hall types palaces ,  mansions ,  ordinary houses , and  pavilions were hierarchically categorized along the lines of which  cai fen  grade was employed. [ 480 ]  For example, palace type buildings used only grades  I  through  V , while mansion type buildings never used components larger than grade  III  and no less than grade  VI . [ 481 ]  In this system of structural carpentry, the smallest grade of  VIII  is represented by one  cai ; one  cai  is equal to the modern equivalent of 15 cm (5.9 in), while one  cai  is also divided into fifteen  fen  (hence the title of this modular system). [ 482 ]   Mountain-and-water painting : The Chinese upheld a long tradition of  landscape art  before the emergence in the  Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period  (907960) of the distinctive  shan shui  (), or mountain-water, style which aimed to ""encapsulate the  cosmos "" according to Sarah Allan, [ 483 ]  and not merely represent natural  scenery . She writes that mountains and rivers were chosen to symbolize permanence and change, respectively, with an occasional anonymous person strolling in a vast landscape to emphasize that people belong ""naturally within the cosmos rather than given unusual prominence;"" in other words, these paintings deemphasize a human-centered world. [ 484 ]  It should be noted that, although this style of painting persisted into the following eras, there were continuing artistic trends amongst the  gentry elite  which diverged from it. In the era of  Northern Song  (9601127), the  scholar-bureaucrat  most often painted huge sweeping landscape scenes with tiny human figures placed into a much larger whole, emphasizing their overriding concern to tackle the largest nationwide issues and reforming society from the top down. [ 485 ]  During the  Southern Song  (11271279), statesmen more often painted intimately close scenes where human figures were the central focus with a surrounding environment lacking similar detail, emphasizing their  Neo-Confucian  concern of reforming society from the bottom up and from the local level. [ 485 ]   Multiple-tube seed drill : The wooden seed drill existed in China by the 3rd century BC, while the multiple-tube iron seed drill was first invented in China by the 2nd century BC, during the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD). [ 486 ] [ 487 ]  The seed drill allowed for greater speed and regulation of  distributing seeds in lined rows of crops  instead of casting them out onto the farm field. [ 486 ]   Multistage rocket : Although there is still some ambiguity as to whether the earliest  rockets  of the 13th century were first developed in  Europe  (i.e. 'ignis volantis in aere' in the work of Marcus Graecus around 1232, although Needham and Davis assert it was most likely a  fire lance ), the  Middle East  (i.e. 'sahm al-Khiti' or 'arrows of China' as referred to by Hasan al-Rhammh in 1280) or  China  (i.e. 'di lao shu' or 'ground rat' mentioned in 1264 or the 'chong'  mortar  used by the armies of the  Song Dynasty  and invading  Mongols  during the 1270s), sometime during the  Yuan Dynasty  (12711368) the term ' fire arrow ' once implied to mean incendiary arrows during the  Tang Dynasty  was then used to describe the true rocket, producing a headache, as Needham says, for historians; [ 488 ] [ 360 ] [ 32 ]  the  Huolongjing  written by  Jiao Yu  (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and  Liu Ji  (13111375) during the early  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) described several types of rockets, [ 489 ]  one of them being a multistage rocket known as the 'huo long chu shui' or 'fire dragon issuing from the water' which, despite its name, was not launched from beneath the water from a primitive submarine but rather at near water-level maintaining a flat trajectory; defined as a two-stage rocket, it employed  booster rockets  that, when about to burn out of use, ignited a swarm of smaller rocket arrows fired from the front end of the missile shaped as a dragon's mouth. [ 490 ] [ 491 ]       [ edit ]   N     Natural gas as fuel : Robert Temple asserts that the 4th century BC ( Warring States Period ) is a conservative estimate for the time in which the Chinese began using natural gas as fuel and light. [ 183 ]  He states that systematic  borehole  drilling for  brine  extraction by the 1st century BC ( Han Dynasty ) led to the discovery of many ""fire wells"" in  Sichuan  which yielded natural gas. [ 183 ]  As recorded in the 2nd century AD, this led to a systematic search for natural gas. [ 183 ]  Both brine and natural gas were  piped through bamboo tubes ; from small boreholes the gas could be piped directly to burners where the brine was emptied into  cast iron  evaporation pans for boiling and producing  salt , but the pungent gas piped from depths of some 2,000 ft (610 m) had to be first mixed with air lest an explosion occur. [ 374 ]  To remedy this, the Chinese piped the gas first into a large wooden, cone-shaped chamber placed 3 m (10 ft) below ground level where another pipe could convey air, thus turning the chamber into a large  carburetor . [ 374 ]  To avoid fires from a sudden surplus of gas, an additional ""sky thrusting pipe"" was used as an  exhaust system . [ 492 ]   Naval mine : The  Huolongjing  military manuscript written by  Jiao Yu  (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and  Liu Ji  (13111375) also describes naval mines used at sea or on rivers and lakes; made of  wrought iron  and enclosed in an ox bladder, it was a timed device in that a burning  joss stick  floating above the mine determined when the fuse was to be ignited; the text explicitly mentions that without air and doused in water the fuse would not burn, so the fuse was protected by a long  waterproof  tube made out of goat's intestine; a later model shown in  Song Yingxing 's (15871666) encyclopedia of 1637 shows the ox bladder replaced with a  lacquered leather  bag while the mine is ignited by a rip cord pulled from the shore to rotate a flint-and-steel firing mechanism. [ 493 ]   Negative numbers, symbols for and use of : In the  Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art  compiled during the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) by 179 AD and commented on by  Liu Hui  (fl. 3rd century) in 263, [ 309 ]  negative numbers appear as black rods and positive numbers as red rods in the Chinese  counting rods  system. [ 494 ]  Liu Hui also used slanted counting rods to denote negative numbers. [ 494 ]  Negative numbers denoted by a ""+"" sign also appear in the ancient  Bakhshali manuscript  of  India , yet scholars disagree as to when it was compiled, giving a collective range of 200 to 600 AD. [ 495 ]  Negative numbers were known in India certainly by about 630 AD, when the mathematician  Brahmagupta  (598668) used them. [ 494 ]  Negative numbers were first used in Europe by the  Greek  mathematician  Diophantus  (fl. 3rd century) in about 275 AD, yet were considered absurd  in the West  until  The Great Art  written in 1545 by the  Italian  mathematician  Girolamo Cardano  (15011576). [ 494 ]       [ edit ]   O     Open-spandrel segmental arch bridge, fully stone : The earliest known fully-stone open-spandrel segmental arch bridge is the  Zhaozhou Bridge  in southern  Hebei  province, China, completed in 605 by the  Sui Dynasty  (581618) engineer Li Chun. [ 496 ] [ 497 ] [ 498 ]  The bridge span is 37.5 m (123 ft) and the structure relatively light in weight due to the four semi-circular arch spandrels which allow for additional flood waters to pass through. [ 498 ]  Other Chinese bridges would be influenced by this design, such as the open-spandrel Yongtong Bridge of Zhaoxian, Hebei built in 1130, [ 499 ]  and the simple segmental arch  Lugou Bridge  built in 1698 (originally in 1189). [ 500 ]  The latter, located just west of  Beijing , features eleven segmental arches, each with a span of 18.8 m (62 ft) in a total bridge span of 213 m (700 ft). [ 501 ]       [ edit ]   P     Pagoda, hybrid of the stupa and  que  tower : The  pagoda , a  Buddhist  monument where sacred relics are housed, was first developed in  ancient India  as a dome-like structure with a circular base commonly referred to as the  stupa . [ 502 ]  After  Buddhism spread to China  during the  Eastern Han  (25220 AD) period, the Chinese adopted this idea of a religious structure to house sacred Buddhist relics, yet they  sinicized  its design by fusing it with the design of the square-based  que  tower, a common building type in traditional  Chinese architecture . [ 502 ]  The unique  Chinese pagoda  thus became a multi-storied tower rather than an elongated dome-like structure as seen in the original stupa. [ 502 ]   Pi calculated as  : The ancient  Egyptians ,  Babylonians ,  Indians , and  Greeks  had  long made approximations for   by the time the Chinese mathematician and astronomer  Liu Xin  (c. 46 BC23 AD) improved the old Chinese approximation of simply 3 as  to 3.1547 as  (with evidence on vessels dating to the  Wang Mang  reign period, 923 AD, of other approximations of 3.1590, 3.1497, and 3.1679). [ 503 ] [ 504 ]  Next,  Zhang Heng  (78139 AD) made two approximations for , by proportioning the celestial circle to the diameter of the earth as   = 3.1724 and using (after a long algorithm) the  square root  of 10, or 3.162. [ 504 ] [ 505 ] [ 506 ]  In his commentary on the  Han Dynasty  mathematical work  The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art ,  Liu Hui  (fl. 3rd century)  used various algorithms  to render multiple approximations for pi at 3.142704, 3.1428, and 3.14159. [ 507 ]  Finally, the mathematician and astronomer  Zu Chongzhi  (429500) approximated pi to an even greater degree of accuracy, rendering it  , a value known in Chinese as  Mil (""detailed ratio"") . [ 508 ]  This was the best  rational  approximation for pi with a  denominator  of up to four digits; the next rational number is  , which is the  best rational approximation . Zu ultimately determined the value for  to be between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927. [ 509 ]  Zu's approximation was the most accurate in the world, and would not be achieved elsewhere for another millennium, [ 510 ]  until  Madhava of Sangamagrama [ 511 ]  and  Jamshd al-Ksh [ 512 ]  in the early 15th century.   Pinhole camera : The  Greek  philosopher  Aristotle  (384322 BC) observed that the spaces between the leaves of trees acted as tiny pinholes which cast the image of a partial  solar eclipse  onto the ground. [ 513 ]  He also used a metal plate with a small pinhole to project an image of a solar eclipse onto the ground. [ 513 ]  The ancient  Chinese  philosopher  Mozi  (c. 470 BCc. 391 BC)founder of  Mohism  during the establishment of the  Hundred Schools of Thought lived just before the time of Aristotle and it was in his  Mojing  (perhaps compiled by his disciples) that a pinhole camera was described. [ 514 ]  The  Mojing  stated that the ""collecting place"" (pinhole) was an empty hole ""like the sun and moon depicted on the imperial flags,"" where an image could be inverted at an intersecting point which ""affects the size of the image."" [ 514 ]  The  Mojing  seems to be in line with the  Epicurean theory  of light traveling into the eye (and not vice versa like in  Pythagoreanism ), [ 515 ]  since the  Mojing  states that the reflected light shining forth from an ""illuminated person"" becomes inverted when passing through the pinhole, i.e. ""The bottom part of the man becomes the top part (of the image) and the top part of the man becomes the bottom part (of the image)."" [ 514 ]  In his  Book of Optics  (1021),  Ibn al-Haytham  (9651039) wrote of his experimentation with  camera obscura , which was followed by  Shen Kuo  (10311095), the latter who alluded that the  Tang Dynasty  (618907) author  Duan Chengshi  (died 863)in his  Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang described inverted images of  Chinese pagodas . [ 516 ]   Playing cards : The first reference to the card game in world history dates no later than the 9th century, when the  Collection of Miscellanea at Duyang , written by Su E (fl. 880), described the Wei clan (family of Princess Tongchang's husband) of the  Tang Dynasty  (618907 AD) enjoying the ""leaf game"" in 868. [ 517 ] [ 518 ] [ 519 ]  The  Yezi Gexi  was a book on the card came which was allegedly written by a Tang woman and commented on by Chinese scholars in subsequent dynasties. [ 520 ] [ 521 ]  In his  Notes After Retirement , the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) scholar  Ouyang Xiu  (10071072) asserted that playing card games existed since the mid Tang Dynasty and associated this invention with the simultaneous evolution of the common Chinese writing medium from paper rolls to sheets of paper that could be printed. [ 518 ] [ 520 ] [ 521 ]  During the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644), characters from popular  novels  such as the  Water Margin  were widely featured on the faces of playing cards. [ 520 ] [ 521 ]  By the 11th century playing cards could be found throughout the Asian continent. [ 522 ]  Playing cards were some of the first printed materials in Europe, appearing by the 14th century (i.e. in  Spain  and  Germany  in 1377, in  Italy  and  Belgium  in 1379, and in  France  in 1381) and produced by European  woodblock printing  before the innovation of the  printing press  by  Johannes Gutenberg  (c. 14001468). [ 522 ] [ 523 ]   Porcelain :  Although glazed ceramics existed beforehand , S.A.M. Adshead writes that the earliest type of vitrified, translucent ceramics that could be classified as true porcelain was not made until the  Tang Dynasty  (618907). [ 524 ]  Nigel Wood states that true porcelain was manufactured in  North China  from roughly the beginning of the Tang Dynasty in the 7th century, while true porcelain was not manufactured in  South China  until about 300 years later, during the early 10th century. [ 525 ]   Pound lock : Although the one gate canal  flash lock  existed in China beforehand, the two-gate pound lock was invented in China in 984 by an official of  Huainan  and engineer named Qiao Weiyo, during the early  Song Dynasty  (9601279), so that ships could safely travel along canal waterways having gated and segmented chambers where water levels could be regulated. [ 526 ] [ 527 ] [ 528 ]  The economic and transport benefits of this innovation were described by the polymath official and inventor  Shen Kuo  (10311095) in his  Dream Pool Essays . [ 526 ] [ 529 ]   Puppet theater, waterwheel-powered : The mechanical toys of  Roman Egypt , especially the weight-driven  puppet  theater of  Heron of Alexandria  (c. 1070 AD), are well known and discussed by historians such as Beck, Prou, and de Rochas d'Aiglun. [ 530 ]  In China,  Zhang Heng  (78139) wrote of plays with artificial fish and dragons, while a 6th century text  Xijing Zaji  states that when Liu Bang (reigned as  Emperor Gaozu of Han  from 202195 BC) came upon the treasury of the deceased  Qin Shihuang  (r. 221210) in 206 BC, he found an entire mechanical  orchestra  of 1 m (3 ft) tall puppets dressed in  silk  and playing  mouth organs , all powered by pulling ropes and blowing into tubes. [ 531 ]  As written in the  Records of the Three Kingdoms , the engineer  Ma Jun  (fl. 220265)already associated with the  differential gear system  of the  South Pointing Chariot invented a mechanical theater powered by a rotating wooden  waterwheel  for the entertainment of  Emperor Ming's  (r. 226239 AD) court. [ 531 ]  With the waterwheel in motion, a number of mechanical puppets performed tricks, such as singing girls who played music and danced, other puppets who would beat drums and sound flutes when one puppet entered the scene, puppets dancing on balls, throwing swords, hanging upside down on rope ladders, etc. [ 531 ]  Other mechanical puppets dressed as government officials did tasks in their offices, puppets dressed as laborers did jobs of pounding and grinding ( trip hammer  and  millstone ), while others watched  cockfighting , all moving simultaneously. [ 531 ]  Water-powered puppet theaters in the tradition of Ma Jun were created in later dynasties as well. [ 532 ]       [ edit ]   Q     [ edit ]   R     Raised-relief map : In his 1665 paper for the  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society ,  John Evelyn  (16201706) believed that wax models imitating nature and bas relief maps were something entirely new from  France . [ 533 ]  Some later scholars attributed the first raised-relief map to one Paul Dox, who represented the area of  Kufstein  in his raised-relief map of 1510. [ 533 ] [ 534 ]  The 20th century historian  G. Sarton  pointed to the writing of  Ibn Battuta  (13041368 or 1377), the latter who witnessed a raised-relief map while on  Gibraltar  in the 14th century. [ 533 ] [ 534 ]  However, the raised-relief map may have existed in China since the 3rd century BC, if the accounts in the  Records of the Grand Historian  (by  Sima Qian , 91 BC) about  Qin Shi Huang 's (r. 221210 BC) tomb prove correct (when it is excavated). [ 354 ]  It is known that  Ma Yuan  (14 BC49 AD) created a raised-relief map in 32 AD made out of rice, a type of map described in detail during the  Tang Dynasty  (618907) by Jiang Fang in his  Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains with Rice  (c. 845). [ 354 ]  Xie Zhuang (421466) of the  Liu Song Dynasty  (420479) created a 0.93 m 2  (10 ft 2 ) wooden raised-relief map of the empire (showing mountains and rivers) which could be taken apart and pieced together like a giant  jigsaw puzzle . [ 354 ]  While on a court assignment of inspection along the  Song Empire's  (9601279) frontier, the  polymath  scholar and official  Shen Kuo  (10311095) created a three-dimensional, raised-relief map depicting miniature roads, rivers, mountains and passes composed of wood, glue-soaked sawdust, beeswax, and wheat paste. [ 535 ] [ 536 ] [ 537 ] [ 538 ]  His wooden model pleased  Emperor Shenzong of Song  (r. 10671085), who later ordered that all the prefects administering the frontier regions should prepare similar wooden maps which could be sent to the capital and stored in an archive. [ 537 ]  In 1130, Huang Shang made a wooden raised-relief map which later caught the attention of the  Neo-Confucian  philosopher  Zhu Xi  (11301200), who tried to acquire it but instead made his own map out of sticky clay and wood. [ 537 ] [ 538 ]  The map, made of eight pieces of wood connected by hinges, could be folded up and carried around by one person. [ 537 ]   Restaurant menu : During the early  Song Dynasty  (9601279), urban shopkeepers of the  merchant middle class  often had little time to eat at home, so they ventured out to eat at a variety of places such as temples, taverns, tea houses, food stalls, and  restaurants  which provided business for nearby brothels, singing-girl houses, and  drama theatres ; this along with  traveling foreigners  and Chinese who migrated to urban centers from regions with different cooking styles encouraged a demand for a variety of flavors served at urban restaurants, giving rise to the menu. [ 539 ] [ 540 ]   Rocket bombs, aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads : In 1741,  Amde-Franois Frzier  (16821773) was the first in  Europe  to construct rocket bombs with  aerodynamic wings and fins  to maintain a steady and stable  trajectory  when fired. [ 541 ]  However, the first known rockets fitted with aerodynamic wings are described as the 'flying crows with magic fire' in the oldest strata of the  Huolongjing  (early-to-mid 14th century), compiled by  Jiao Yu  and  Liu Ji  during the early  Ming Dynasty  (13681644). [ 542 ]  The body of the rocket was shaped like a bird (specifically a  crow ), packed with  gunpowder , and made of  bamboo   laths  forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with  glued  paper. [ 543 ]  A decorative head and tail were attached to the front and back ends, while the wings were nailed to the sides. [ 543 ]  Under each wing were two slanting rockets to propel the weapon; a main fuse was lit that ignited a fourfold fuse connected to each rocket and running through a drilled hole in the back of the bird. [ 543 ]  The book then claims that the rocket, after being launched high into the air and aimed at encampments or enemy boats,  automatically produced an explosion upon impact  that could be seen from considerably long distances. [ 544 ]  The  Wubeizhi , published in 1621, described a weapon called the 'free-flying enemy-pounding thunder-crash bomb', which was another winged rocket secured with oily paper and had a tubed rocket built into the rear of the bomb. [ 544 ]  When the composition of the rocket was burnt out in flight, the rocket automatically ignited and released a poisonous blast of smoke and  caltrops  with poisoned tips. [ 544 ]   Rotary fan, manual and water-powered : For purposes of  air conditioning , the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) craftsman and engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) invented a manually-operated rotary fan having seven wheels that measured 3 m (10 ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the  Tang Dynasty  (618907), the Chinese applied  hydraulic power  to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning, while the rotary fan became even more common during the  Song Dynasty  (9601279). [ 545 ] [ 546 ]  The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by  Georg Agricola  (14941555). [ 547 ]   Rudder, stern-mounted and vertical axial : Lawrence V. Mott, who defines a steering oar as a rudder, states the  ancient Egyptian  use of stern-mounted rudders can be traced back to the  6th dynasty  (2350-2200 BC). [ 548 ]  Mott states that the method of attachment for rudders in the Arab, Chinese, and European worlds differed from each other, leading him to doubt the spread of the Chinese system of attachment by socket-and-jaws or  block and tackle  (versus European  pintle -and- gudgeon  invented by c. 1180 AD). [ 548 ] [ 549 ]  In regards to Mott's definition of a steering oar as a rudder,  Joseph Needham ,  Richard Lefebvre des Nottes , K.S. Tom, Chung Chee Kit, S.A.M. Adshead, Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that a steering oar is not a rudder; the steering oar has the capacity to interfere with handling of the sails (limiting any potential for long ocean-going voyages) while it was fit more for small vessels on narrow, rapid-water transport; the rudder did not disturb the handling of the sails, took less energy to operate by its  helmsman , was better fit for larger vessels on ocean-going travel, and first appeared in China. [ 550 ] [ 551 ] [ 203 ] [ 552 ] [ 549 ]  Leo Block writes of the use of the steering oar in the ancient  Mediterranean world  (specifically in regards to the  Phoenicians , 1550300 BC): ""A single sail tends to turn a vessel in an upwind or downwind direction, and rudder action is required to steer a straight course. A steering oar was used at this time because the rudder had not yet been invented. With a single sail, a frequent movement of the steering oar was required to steer a straight course; this slowed down the vessel because a steering oar (or rudder) course correction acts like a break."" [ 553 ]  The oldest depicted rudders at the back of a ship, without the use of  oars  or a steering oar, comes from several ceramic models of Chinese ships made during both the Western and Eastern eras of the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD). [ 554 ] [ 555 ] [ 203 ] [ 556 ]  According to the scholars Zhang Zunyan and Vassilios Christides, there is literary evidence to suggest that the axial stern rudder existed in China since the 1st century BC, [ 557 ]  while Gang Deng asserts the first reference was made in the  Huainanzi  of the 2nd century BC, [ 556 ]  and K.S. Tom says the first clear reference dates to the 5th century AD. [ 203 ]  However, K.S. Tom points to the fact that all Chinese pottery models of ships before this Guangzhou tomb model show steering oars instead of a rudder, which he states is strong evidence for the rudder's invention only by the 1st century AD. [ 558 ]  Jacques Gernet states that while the Chinese had invented the rudder in the 1st century AD, it was not completely fixed to the sternpost of Chinese ships until the end of the 4th century. [ 559 ]  The bulkhead ship design of the  junk , which appeared roughly the same time as the rudder, provided the essential vertical components for the hinged axial rudder. [ 435 ]  Deng points out that an Eastern Han (25220) model distinctly shows a rudder located in its own separate cabin, suggesting that helmsmanship had already become an established profession. [ 556 ]  Following the invention of the balanced rudder pivoted on an axis, Tom and Deng state that the Chinese then innovated the fenestrated rudder by the  Song Dynasty  (9601279), with deliberate puncturing and boring out of holes in shapes such as diamonds, which, according to Tom, made the rudder ""easier to steer, reduced turbulence drag, did not affect efficiency and was hydrodynamically sound."" [ 560 ] [ 556 ]       [ edit ]   S          A replica of  Zhang Heng 's (78139 AD)  seismometer  that employed a pendulum sensitive to  inertia  of ground tremors; while placed in  Luoyang  in 133, it detected an  earthquake  400 to 500 km (250 to 310 mi) away in  Gansu              One of five printed star maps from  Su Song 's (10201101) celestial atlas, included in his book on  horology  first printed in 1094              Molten  steel ; the Chinese produced steel from  cast iron  in a process of  decarburization  since the 2nd century BC              A  sancai -glazed horse statue from the  Tang Dynasty  (618907) showing a rider's  stirrup  connected to the  saddle              The  Luding Bridge  in  Sichuan , an iron-chain suspension bridge              A page of  The Classic of Tea  by the  Tang  connoisseur of tea,  Lu Yu  (733804)              A woman with  goiter ; the Chinese treated goiter with  iodine -rich  thyroid  hormones since the 7th century AD during the  Tang Dynasty  (618907).               Tofu  in  miso soup ; the Chinese invented tofu as early as the 2nd century BC during the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) if the traditional accounts about  Liu An  are correct.              A wall mural of  Li Xian 's tomb at  Qianling Mausoleum  (dated 706 AD), where the tomb murals and structural designs corresponded with the appearances and layouts, respectively, of actual residences where the tomb occupants had once lived during the  Tang Dynasty              A Chinese  Song Dynasty  naval river ship with a Xuanfeng traction trebuchet catapult, taken from the  Wujing Zongyao , 1044 AD              Hydraulic-powered  trip hammers , from a  Ming Dynasty  encyclopedia published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing  (15871666)              An ornate bronze bell belonging to  Duke Mu of Qin  (d. 621 BC) from the  Spring and Autumn Period  (722481 BC)              The underwater salvage operation for the  SS Andrea Doria , seen here sinking on  July 25 ,  1956 , was similar to the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) Chinese underwater salvage of iron oxen statues from a river bed.         Seismometer : The official, astronomer, and mathematician  Zhang Heng  (78139) of the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) invented the first seismometer in 132, a large metal urn-shaped instrument which employed either a suspended  pendulum  or  inverted pendulum  acting on inertia (i.e. ground tremors from  earthquakes ) to dislodge a metal ball by a lever trip device; this ball would fall out of dragon-shaped metal mouth into the corresponding metal toad mouth indicating the exact cardinal direction of where a distant earthquake had occurred in order for the state to send swift aid and relief to the affected regions; several subsequent recreations of his device were employed by Chinese states up until the  Tang Dynasty  (618907), when use of the device fell into obscurity, a fact noted even by the writer Zhou Mi around 1290, during the  Yuan Dynasty  (12711368). [ 561 ] [ 562 ] [ 563 ] [ 564 ] [ 565 ] [ 566 ] [ 567 ] [ 560 ]   South Pointing Chariot : Although the claim of  Wei Dynasty  statesman  Ma Jun  (fl. 220265) that the South Pointing Chariot was first invented by the mythological  Yellow Emperor  are dubious, his South Pointing Chariot was successfully designed and tested in 255 AD with many later models recreated in subsequent dynasties; this device was a wheeled vehicle with  differential gears  that ensured a mounted wooden figurine would always point in the southern direction no matter how the vehicle turned, in essence a non-magnetic  compass . [ 568 ] [ 569 ] [ 570 ]  The  Book of Song  written in the 6th century states that the device was successfully reinvented by the mathematician and astronmer  Zu Chongzhi  (429500) during the  Liu Song Dynasty  (420479). [ 571 ]  The  Japanese  historical text  Nihon Shoki , compiled by 720, states that the device was crafted and presented as a gift to  Emperor Tenji  (661672) on two different occasions (658 and 666) by the  Tang Dynasty  (618907)  Chinese Buddhist  monks Zhi Yu and Zhi You. [ 572 ]  The wheeled vehicle device was described in intricate detail in the historical text covering the  Song Dynasty  (9601279), i.e. the  Song Shi  (compiled 1345); for example, it revealed the number of gear teeth on each mechanical gear wheel, the diameter of each gear wheel, and how these gear wheels were properly positioned. [ 573 ]   Star catalogue : China's earliest known astronomers were  Gan De  of the  Qi State  and  Shi Shen  of the  Wei State , who created the earliest known star catalogues during the 4th century BC, roughly two centuries before the star catalogue of the Greek astronomer and mathematician  Hipparchus  (c. 190c. 120 BC). [ 574 ] [ 10 ]  The star catalogue became a permanent feature of  Chinese astronomy  and some were quite large, such as the star catalogue of astronomer  Zhang Heng  (78139) who catalogued 2,500 stars, placing them in a 'brightly shining' category, and recognized 124 constellations. [ 167 ] [ 575 ]   Star chart, oldest printed : Although certainly not the oldest existing star charts in the world, the star charts of the astronomer, official, and engineer  Su Song  (10201101) are the oldest  printed  star charts in the world. [ 576 ]  His celestial atlas of five star charts were included in his book covering the workings of his  clock tower , written by 1092 and published in 1094 with several later editions published in the 12th, 17th, and 19th centuries. [ 577 ]  Su's star charts also feature the corrected position of the  pole star  as fixed by his contemporary  Shen Kuo  (10311095) by three degrees (i.e. halfway between -350 degrees and  Polaris ). [ 578 ]   Steel made from cast iron through oxygenation : The Chinese, who had been producing  cast iron  from the late  Spring and Autumn Period  (722481 BC), produced  steel  by the 2nd century BC through a process of  decarburization , i.e. using  bellows  to pump  large amounts of oxygen  on to molten cast iron. [ 579 ]  This was first described in the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) book  Huainanzi , compiled by scholars under Prince  Liu An  (179122 BC). [ 580 ]  The Chinese called this technique ""the hundred refinings method,"" since the process was repeated over and over to incrementally strengthen the steel. [ 580 ]  The back of  swords  were often made of more elastic  wrought iron  while the cutting edge of the blade itself was made of strong steel. [ 580 ]  For steel, they used both  quenching  (i.e. rapid cooling) and  tempering  (i.e. slow cooling) methods of  heat treatment . [ 580 ]  Much later, the  American  inventor  William Kelly  (18111888) brought four Chinese metallurgists to  Eddyville, Kentucky  in 1845, whose expertise in steelmaking influenced his ideas about air injection to reduce carbon content of iron; his invention anticipated the  Bessemer process  of  Henry Bessemer  (18131898). [ 581 ]   Stirrup : There are authors who point out that it is unclear whether the stirrup was invented by northern nomads or the sedentary Chinese. [ 582 ]  Liu Han (1961) credited the invention of the stirrup to nomadic invaders of northern China. [ 583 ]  Archaeologial evidence shows that horse riders in  India  had a small loop for a single toe to be inserted by roughly the 1st century AD. [ 584 ]  However, the first true depiction of the stirrup is featured on a  Jin Dynasty  (265420) Chinese tomb figurine dated 302 AD, yet this was a single stirrup and was perhaps used only for initially mounting the horse. [ 585 ]  It should be noted that the latter was found in  Changsha ,  Hunan , far from the northern border. [ 586 ]  The first validated depiction of a rider with a pair of saddle stirrups for both feet comes from a Jin Chinese tomb figurine dated 322. [ 585 ]  The first actual specimens of stirrups comes from a Chinese tomb in southern Manchuria that is dated 415. [ 585 ]  The stirrup was not widely used by Chinese cavalry until the 5th century. [ 584 ] [ 587 ]  By the 6th century, the use of the stirrup had spread as far west as the  Byzantine Empire , where both the stirrup and  Celtic   horseshoe  were adopted. [ 584 ]   Suspension bridge using iron chains : Although there is evidence that many early cultures employed the use of suspension bridges with cabled ropes, the first written evidence of iron chain suspension bridges comes from a local history and topography of  Yunnan  written in the 15th century, which describes the repair of an iron chain bridge during the reign of the  Yongle Emperor  (r. 14021424); although it is questionable if  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) Chinese claims that iron chain suspension bridges existed since the Han Dynasty, their existence in the 15th century predates that of anywhere else. [ 588 ]  K.S. Tom mentions this same repaired Ming suspension bridge described by Needham, but adds that recent research has revealed a document which lists the names of those who allegedly built an iron chain suspension bridge in Yunnan around the year 600 AD. [ 589 ]       [ edit ]   T     Tea, as a drink : The tea plant is indigenous to western  Yunnan ; [ 590 ]  by the mid  2nd millennium BC , tea was being consumed in Yunnan for medicinal purposes. [ 591 ]  It was introduced from  Sichuan  to the population of northern China and middle and lower  Yangtze River  around the 2nd century BC. Tea drinking was already an established custom in the daily life in this area as shown by the  Contract with a Slave , written by Wang Bao in 59 BC. [ 592 ]  This written record also reveals that tea, used as a drink instead of a medicinal herb, emerged no later than the 1st century BC. [ 593 ]  Early  Chinese tea culture  began from the time of  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) to the  Southern and Northern Dynasties  (420589) when tea was widely used by Chinese gentry, but only took its initial shape during the  Tang Dynasty  (618907). [ 594 ]  Utensil like handle-less tea bowl which first appeared in the  Eastern Jin Dynasty  (317420), became popular among the tea drinkers of Tang. [ 595 ]  The first book about tea was written by  Lu Yu  (733804) in his  The Classic of Tea . [ 596 ]   Thyroid hormone, treatment of goiter : In 239 BC,  Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals  stated that where water is too light, people suffer widespread  baldness  and  goiter . [ 597 ]  It was not until the 1860 that  Gaspard Adolphe Chatin  (18131901) linked goiter with the lack of  iodine  in soil and water; iodine was discovered in the thyroid gland in 1896 by  Eugen Baumann , while thyroid extract was used to treat patients in 1890. [ 597 ]  Long before this the  Tang Dynasty  (618907) physician Zhen Quan (d. 643 AD), in his  Old and New Tried and Tested Prescriptions , stated that the thyroid glands taken from  gelded   rams  were used to treat patients with goiter; the thyroid hormones could be swallowed in pill form (the body of the pill made from crushed  jujube  pulp) or as a solid thyroid gland with the fat taken off. [ 598 ]  Another prescription by Wang Xi used air-dried glands ground into powder and taken with  wine . [ 599 ]  Zhen's contemporary Cui Zhiti (fl. 650 AD) distinguished in his written work between a  tumor , which he described as an incurbale solid neck swelling, and a real goiter, which he described as curable and movable in the neck. [ 599 ]  The Chinese also used the thyroid glands of  pigs ,  water buffalo , and  sika deer  with success in treating goiter. [ 599 ]  The  Pharmacopoeia of the Heavenly Husbandman  asserted that iodine-rich  sargassum  was used to treat goiter by the 1st century BC ( Ge Hong , 284364, also suggested using a  tincture  derived from sargassum seaweed in about 340 AD), [ 600 ]  a treatment unknown  in the West  until Roger of  Palermo  wrote his  Practica Chirurgiae  in 1180 AD. [ 601 ]   Tofu : Although both popular tradition and  Song-dynasty  (9601279 AD) scholars like  Zhu Xi  (11301200 AD) credit the invention of  tofu along with  soymilk  to  Liu An  (179122 BC), a  Han-Dynasty King  of  Huainan , no mention of tofu is found in the extant  Huainanzi  (compiled under Liu An). [ 602 ] [ 603 ] [ 604 ]  Attempts to show on the basis of tomb reliefs and excavated objects that tofu already existed in the  Han dynasty  are still not entirely convincing. [ 605 ]  The earliest known mention of tofu was made in  Records of the Extraordinary  ( Qingyi lu  ), which reported that tofu was sold at  Qingyang  ( Anhui ). [ 606 ]  Sun Ji (1998) argues that although this book is attributed to Tao Gu (, 903970 AD), it was probably compiled by someone else early in the  northern Song dynasty . [ 607 ]  The earliest explanation of how to make tofu is found in the  Bencao Gangmu , written by  Li Shizhen  (15181593). [ 604 ]  According to Shurtleff and Aoyagi (2001), modern historians suppose that Liu An's tofu, like modern tofu, was made to coagulate with either  seawater  or  nigari , the latter of which is called  lushui  () in Chinese. [ 602 ]  According to Liu Keshun (1999), Liu An's process for making tofu was essentially the same as today: ""Basically,  soybeans  are washed, soaked, and ground with water. The slurry is then filtered to make raw soymilk. The milk is heated before a coagulant is added to form a  curd . The curd is finally pressed to separate  whey  from tofu."" [ 608 ]   Toilet paper : Toilet paper was first mentioned by the official  Yan Zhitui  (531591) in the year 589 during the  Sui Dynasty  (581618), with full evidence of continual use in subsequent dynasties. [ 609 ] [ 610 ]  In the year 851 during the  Tang Dynasty  (618907), a  Muslim   Arab  traveler from the  Middle East  commented that the Chinese used paper  instead of water  to clean themselves while going to the bathroom. [ 609 ]  By the mid 14th century during the  Yuan Dynasty  (12711368), it was written that ten million packages of 1,000 to 10,000 sheets of toilet paper were manufactured annually in  Zhejiang  province alone. [ 609 ]  It is also written that emperors of the  Ming Dynasty  (13681644) used  perfumed  toilet paper. [ 609 ]   Tomb, structural design imitating real life residences : The ancient Chinese built imperial tombs which by structural design imitated the actual living spaces and residences of the deceased tomb occupants when they were alive, a representation of their earthly life which would continue to serve them in the afterlife. For example, Fu Xinian writes that the tomb of  Tang Dynasty  (618907) crown prince  Li Chongrun  (682701) at the  Qianling Mausoleum  had a specific number and layout of ""underground chambers, ventilation shafts, compartments, and air wells"" which would have corresponded to the exact number and layout of ""courtyards, main halls, rooms, and corridors"" of his real palatial residence at  Chang'an . [ 611 ]   Traction trebuchet catapult : The earliest type of trebuchet catapult was the traction trebuchet, developed first in China by the 5th or 4th century BC, the beginning of the  Warring States Period  (403221 BC); to operate the trebuchet, a team of men pulled on ropes attached to the butt of the shorter segment of a long wooden beam separated by a rotating axle fixed to a base framework, allowing the longer segment of the beam to lunge forward and use its sling to hurl a missile; by the 9th century a hybrid of the traction and  counterweight trebuchet , employing manpower and a pivoting weight, was used in the  Middle East ,  Mediterranean Basin , and  Northern Europe ; by the 12th century, the full fledged counterweight trebuchet was developed under the  Ayyubid dynasty  of Islamic Syria and Egypt (described by  Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi ) and used in the  Third Crusade ; by the 13th century, the counterweight trebuchet found its way into  Song Dynasty  (9601279) China via the  Mongol invaders  under  Kublai Khan  (r. 12601294) who used it in the  Siege of Xiangyang  (12671273). [ 612 ] [ 613 ] [ 614 ]   Trip hammer : The ancient Chinese used  pestle and mortar  to pound and decorticate grain, which was superseded by the treadle-operated tilt hammer (employing a simple  lever  and  fulcrum ) perhaps during the  Zhou Dynasty  (1122256 BC) but first described in a  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) dictionary of 40 BC and soon after by  Yang Xiong  (53 BC18 AD) in his  Fangyan  dictionary written in 15 BC; the next stage in this evolution of grain-pounding devices was to apply  hydraulic power , which the author  Huan Tan  (43 BC28 AD) mentioned in his  Xinlun  of 20 AD, although he also described trip hammers powered by the labor of horses, oxen, donkeys, and mules. [ 615 ]  After Huan Tan's book was written, numerous references to trip hammers powered by  waterwheels  were made in subsequent Chinese dynasties and in Medieval Europe by the 12th century. [ 616 ]  However, trip hammers were also attested by both literary ( Pliny ,  Natural History  18.97) and archaeological evidence in fairly widespread use in the  Roman Empire  by the 1st century AD. [ 617 ] [ 618 ]   Tuned bells : The earliest complete set of tuned bells, sixteen in all, were found in Tomb 8 of  Marquis Su of Jin  at Qucun, southern  Shanxi . [ 619 ]  A  355-character inscription  on all sixteen bells collectively describes Marquis Su's participation in a military campaign led by the Zhou king. [ 620 ] [ 621 ]  The tomb has been dated by  AMS  radiocarbon techniques to 815786 BC. [ 622 ]  Tuned  bells  which could produce two precise  musical pitches  (if struck at the center or struck on one side near the edge) existed in China during the  Zhou Dynasty  (c. 1050256 BC). [ 623 ]  Of the  sixty-four bronze bells found  in the  tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng  interred by 433 BC, forty-seven of them produce two notes with  minor third intervals  while sixteen produce two notes with  major third intervals . [ 218 ]  Metal bells in China had their origins in metal grain scoops and measures; after the 6th century BC, the entire ancient Chinese system of measurement in standard length, width, weight, and volume was based on musical pitches of the tuned  zhong  vessel weighing 120  catties , as described in the  Guoyu . [ 218 ]  A 2.1 m (7 ft) long stringed tuner known as a  jun  was used to gauge the standard measure of length of the metal  zhong . [ 218 ]  Bells in ancient China served essentially as  tuning forks  in a standard set of twelve bells ( one for each note ), which were eventually replaced by twelve  pitch pipes  (easier to manufacture). [ 623 ]  In order to craft properly-tuned bells, a set of conditions had to be met: specific proportions of different metals in the  alloy ; elasticity and thickness of material; the  specific gravity ; diameters at different points; the contours of the bells' curves; the temperature reached in casting the bell and the cooling rate, etc. [ 624 ]       [ edit ]   U     Umbrella, collapsable : The sun-shade parasol existed in ancient  Babylonia ,  Greece , and  Rome , yet the first written evidence of collapsible umbrellas with mechanical sliding levers dates to the short-lived  Xin Dynasty  (923 AD), as it was  Wang Mang  (r. 923 AD) in 21 who had them installed on a ceremonial four-wheeled carriage. [ 625 ]  The  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) author Fu Qian commented in the 2nd century AD that collapsible umbrellas had bendable joints which allowed them to be extended or retracted. [ 626 ]  Actual collapsible umbrella stays from Wang Mang's time (or shortly after) have been unearthed at an archaeological excavation of Wang Guang's tomb in what was once the Han colony of  Lelang Commandery  (located now in  North Korea ). [ 627 ]  However, there is strong evidence for collapsable umbrellas being as old as the 6th century BC, during the  Zhou Dynasty  (1122256 BC), as seen in the complex bronze socketed hinges with locking slides and bolts unearthed at  Luoyang  dating to that time. [ 627 ]  During the  Wei Dynasty  (220265), the common material used for the umbrella was changed from silk to an oiled heavy paper derived from the bark of the  mulberry tree , although silk umbrellas could still be found. [ 628 ]   Underwater salvage operations : In 333 BC, nine bronze tripods were lost in the Si River; in 219 BC,  Qin Shihuang  (r. 221210 BC) assembled an expedition to salvage them from the river bed using a system of ropes, but it was unsuccessful (this was even made a subject of art in a  bas-relief  of the period). [ 629 ]  In the 11th century AD, a successful underwater salvage operation in  Song China  (9601279) would employ the use of  buoyancy . [ 630 ]  The Chinese understood the concept of buoyancy by at least the 3rd century AD; the short-lived child prodigy  Cao Chong  (196208) weighed a large  elephant  by placing it on a boat in a pond and measuring the rise of the water level, then matching this weight with a boat loaded with numerous heavy objects which could be measured separately. [ 631 ]  Between 1064 and 1067, the Pujin Bridge near Puzhou, a floating  pontoon bridge  built some 350 years earlier across the  Yellow River , was destroyed in a flood. [ 212 ]  This bridge was made of boats secured by iron chains which were attached to eight different  cast iron  statues located on each river bank, cast in the shape of recumbent  oxen . [ 212 ]  The flood pulled the oxen from the sandy banks into the river, where they sunk to the bottom; after this loss, the local officials issued a proclamation for submission of ideas on how to recover the statues. [ 212 ]  The plan of the Buddhist monk Huaibing was accepted, which Robert Temple describes: ""On his instructions, workers filled two large boats with earth,  and divers attached cables  from them to the oxen in the river bed. Then earth was gradually removed from the boats, which caused them to float higher and higher in the water. To everyone's delight, the buoyancy thus created lifted the oxen from the river bed. They were then dragged into shallower water simply by sailing the boats towards the shore."" [ 630 ]  This same technique was applied to salvage parts of the modern ocean liner  SS Andrea Doria  after it sank in the  Atlantic Ocean  in 1956; instead of filling boats with dirt, water was used and progressively leaked out of ore ships which lifted  the hulk  from 68.5 m (225 ft) below the surface. [ 629 ]       [ edit ]   V     [ edit ]   W          One-wheeled Chinese wheelbarrow, from  Zhang Zeduan 's (10851145) painting  Along the River During Qingming Festival ,  Song Dynasty              Chinese rotary fan winnowing machine, from an encyclopedia published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing               Xiangqi  board game              A modern replica of a Victorian  zoetrope         Wheelbarrow : There is scanty linguistic evidence that wheelbarrows (i.e. the  hyperteria monokyklou , or 'one-wheeler') might have existed in  ancient Greece  by the late 5th century BC, [ 632 ]  but it has been commonly accepted that the wheelbarrow did not exist in Europe until the 13th century AD, [ 633 ]  while their use in  Western Han  (202 BC9 AD) China by the 1st century BC is attested to by written evidence; illustrations of their use were depicted on tomb murals in China by the 2nd century AD, during the  Eastern Han  (25220 AD). [ 634 ] [ 635 ]   Wine server, artificial mountain with a puppet : In the early 8th century, a  Tang Dynasty  (618907) engineer created an elaborate artificial mountain carved out of iron that was 0.9 m (3 ft) tall, sitting atop a  lacquered -wooden frame shaped as a tortoise. [ 636 ]  From the mountain, wine flowed down onto cups that tilted by force of  gravity  and spilled the liquid into an artificial lake of wine; a hydraulic pump siphoned the wine back into a hidden reservoir of the mountain that could store 15 liters (16 quarts) of wine. [ 636 ]  The same pump was used to siphon wine through dragon-headed faucets which had a mouth with movable parts that could open when the wine was poured. [ 636 ]  The wine from the faucet poured into a cup which could be left on a large iron platform shaped as a lotus leaf. [ 636 ]  If the drinker was too slow in consuming the wine and placing the cup back in time, the door of a tiny pavilion on the top of the mountain opened automatically while a small puppet sprang forth holding a menacing bat to taunt the slow drinker. [ 636 ]  Once the cup was placed back on the lotus leaf, the puppet with the bat returned inside the pavilion while the miniature doors closed behind him. [ 636 ]   Winnowing fan : Contemporary to the rotary air conditioning fan invented by Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) is a pottery tomb model of a  crank-operated  rotary winnowing fan from the  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD), used for separating  chaff  from the  grain . [ 637 ] [ 638 ]  The winnowing fan was first described during the  Tang Dynasty  (618907) by  Yan Shigu  (581645), in his commentary on the  Jijiupian  dictionary written earlier in 40 BC by Shi Yu; it was also mentioned in a poem by the  Song Dynasty  (9601279) artist Mei Yaochen in about 1060. [ 639 ]  The earliest known drawn illustration of the winnowing fan comes from the  Book of Agriculture  published in 1313 by  Wang Zhen  (fl. 12901333). [ 640 ]       [ edit ]   X     Xiangqi  (See also:  List of Chinese inventions#L  -  Liubo ): The exact origins of the Chinese chess board game known as  xiangqi  are ambiguous. Historian  David H. Li  asserts that it was first invented by  Han Xin  (d. 196 BC), a renowned military general of the early  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD) who fell victim to a purge instigated by  Empress L Zhi  (d. 180 BC), who accused him of trying to rebel, hence his board game quickly came to be associated with his infamous legacy. [ 641 ]  However, Li states that it was revived under a different, camouflaged name of  xiangxi  by  Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou  (r. 561578), which to this day has made the two terms synonymous and interchangeable for the same game. [ 642 ]  Playing of the game was banned during the  Sui Dynasty  (581618), yet  Emperor Taizong  (r. 626649) of the  Tang Dynasty  (618907) became an enthusiast of the game and poets like  Bai Juyi  (772846) even dedicated poems to it. [ 643 ]  Variants of the game include  banqi  and  giog .       [ edit ]   Y     [ edit ]   Z     Zoetrope : There is some evidence that the zoetrope, an primitive ancestor of the  cinematograph  which the Chinese called a ""magic lantern"", existed amongst the items of the treasury of the deceased  Qin Shi Huang  (r. 221210 BC) of the  Qin Dynasty  (221206 BC). [ 644 ] [ 645 ]  A magician named Shao Ong who staged a  seance  for  Emperor Wu of Han  (r. 14187 BC) may have used a zoetrope in his performance of 121 BC. [ 645 ]  The first clear evidence of the zoetrope used in China comes from the late  Han Dynasty  (202 BC220 AD), when the artisan  Ding Huan  () made a 'nine-storied hill-censer' around 180 AD. [ 644 ] [ 645 ]  This featured figures of birds and other animals who moved when the lamp was lit; the convection of rising hot air currents caused the vanes at the top canopy of the lamp to spin, while the painted figures on paper attached to the side of the cylinder gave the impression that they were in movement. [ 644 ]  This sort of toy was remade in subsequent dynasties as well.

clueweb09-enwp00-23-15143	"                     Breaking (martial arts)          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (July 2007)                 This article's  citation style may be unclear . The references used may be clearer with a different or consistent style of  citation ,  footnoting , or  external linking .              Breaking techniques are often practiced in Tae Kwon Do. Here four concrete paving bricks are broken with a knife-hand strike.       Breaking  is a  martial arts  skill that is used in competition, demonstration and testing. Breaking is an action where a martial artist uses a striking surface to break one or more objects using the skills honed in his or her art form. The striking surface is usually a  hand  or a  foot , but may also be a  fingertip ,  toe ,  head ,  elbow ,  knuckle , or  knee . The most common object is a piece of  wood . However, it is also common to break  bricks  or  cinder blocks . It is less common to break other objects which include items like blocks of  ice . Not all styles of martial arts place equal emphasis on breaking. Many styles where  striking  and  kicking  is less important deemphasize it.  Grappling ,  throwing ,  weaponry  and ground fighting styles, of course, place less emphasis on breaking. Traditional Japanese martial art schools place little, if any, emphasis on board-breaking, although the art of breaking objects was known as  tameshiwari .   Competition can be based on artistic impression, number of items broken in a given amount of time, number of items broken with a single strike, or time to break a number of items. There are several certified breaking categories in various journals of world records such as the  Guinness Book .   In a demonstration, a martial artist exhibits his or her skill by executing an impromptu or choreographed sequence of breaks for an audience. Martial arts schools sometimes demonstrate challenging breaks in order to gain publicity and inspire enrollment or attendance.   During promotion testing, many styles of martial arts require that students demonstrate their skills by executing breaks; the difficulty of a required break depends on the rank for which the student is testing. Failure to execute a required break is often sufficient grounds for failure of a promotion test.          A brick-breaking demonstration       Wooden boards are the most common breaking item in most martial arts. Individual boards used may range from nominal sizes as small as 6""x12""x1"" to as large as 12""x12""x1"" (a board with a nominal width of 1"" has an actual width of 3/4""). The typical adult testing board is approximately 10""x12""x1"". [ 1 ]  Children may use narrower and thinner boards with 4 and 5 year olds sometimes breaking boards as small as 4""x12""x1/2"".           Contents       1   Speed vs. Power vs. Impulse   2   Pegged vs. unpegged (Spaced vs. unspaced)   3   Technique   4   External links   5   References               [ edit ]   Speed vs. Power vs. Impulse   There are generally two common classifications of breaks: speed breaks and power breaks. There is a third lesser-known classification known as the impulse break.   Speed breaks are breaks where the striking object is not held in place. The only way to break the object is to strike the surface with sufficient speed at a focused point of impact. Sometimes a board to be broken is held lightly between two fingers by a person; an advanced  dan  test may involve an attempt to break a board as it falls through the air. Regardless of the strength of the striker, the board will only break if it is struck with sufficient  velocity .   Another type of ""Speed Break"" is that which involves breaking a number of objects over a given amount of time. A common time span is 1 minute, but this can vary depending on the material and venue. In competition it is very common for a speed breaking category to limit the time to 8-10 seconds, enabling more competitors to participate. Records and specifics are kept track of by leading martial arts breaking organizations such as the USBA/WBA (United States and World Breaking Associations) and the ISKA (International Sports Karate Association).   Power breaks are breaks where the striking object is supported. Either the break will employ human holders for horizontal, angular, or upward vertical strikes, or the break will require that the objects be stacked for downward vertical strikes. For a stacked break the object is placed on sturdy supporting objects, such as concrete blocks, that are placed on the ground. Many color belt (belts before black belt) promotion testing breaks are power breaks -- it is substantially easier for an inexperienced person to muster sufficient energy to break a wooden board with a power break (Note, this is not true for all breaks). The vast majority of these employ human board holders. Often a stronger or more powerful striker may substitute some strength for technique and successfully accomplish the break. Most records that are catalogued are for power breaks. It is very common for black belt tests to use bricks, concrete patio blocks, or several boards stacked on top of supporting objects for challenging downward strikes.   Taped boards are sometimes used to lessen the amount of human influence from the holders for a break. It is very difficult to hold a stack of boards more than 4 inches steadily enough for challenging break. Therefore, some strikers will tape a stack of boards together to make a ""brick"" for their holders to hold. Usually however, test breaks at promotions and events are done without taped boards.   Both the speed and power breaks deliver the energy required to overcome the tensor and flexion forces of the board through  mass displacement , where the kinetic energy is given by 1/2 m*v 2 . That is, either the speed of the striking implement (hand/foot/etc) has to be high enough, or the striker must be strong enough to increase effective mass brought into the break (i.e. his or her body weight) to exceed the brick/board's threshold. For single boards, it is generally easy (as in the casual person has a sufficient reserve of mass) to reach this threshold through a power break.   Though fundamentally different, the third kind of break -- the impulse break -- is often confused with a speed break, because the striking implement  can  (but need not) reach a high speed. But that is where the similarity ends. The energy transmission from an impulse break derives not from mass displacement, but from wave transmission. (As an ocean wave hits a beach) The mass of the hand/foot/etc does not travel much further than necessary to deliver the wave -- this results in an extremely brief contact with the brick or board face (as opposed to going ""through it""), and the wave itself causes the striking surface to flex and buckle. The less flexible the striking surface, the more likely to break.     [ edit ]   Pegged vs. unpegged (Spaced vs. unspaced)   There are two types of multiple stacked board settings: pegged (spaced) and unpegged (unspaced). Unpegged stacks are stacks where multiple items are stacked directly on top of each other. Typically, whether stacked or human held and whether taped or untaped, approximately 6-7 unpegged boards is equivalent to a brick in terms of degree of difficulty (the required force and form to successfully execute the break). However, a single brick is more dangerous in terms of the potential for injury. Therefore, many schools for liability reasons substitute a stack of boards for a single brick. (Please keep in mind that because of the wide variety in the consistency and material of bricks and concrete patio blocks that comparisons between materials is hard to gauge. Experience is an important factor in cross-material comparison.)   Pegged stacks are stacks where multiple items are stacked with spacing items (often referred to as spacers) between them. Common spacing items are pegs,  nuts ,  coins , and  pencils . Most records involved stacked boards because these are more forgiving and cause fewer injuries to strikers who are pushing themselves to their physical limits. A given number of pegged boards is equated in difficulty with a larger number of unpegged boards to a certain degree. For example, depending upon the spacers used, some consider approximately 3 pegged boards equivalent in difficulty to 5 unpegged boards. As the number of pegged boards increases this ratio shifts, meaning a stack of 10 unpegged boards is more difficult than a stack of 10 pegged boards. Unpegged bricks pose a greater degree of difficulty than that of pegged bricks.   This is due to the way in which the two materials break. Wood, which is a natural fibrous matrix, flexes to a certain degree before it snaps at the target point. When unpegged, this allows for an entire stack of wood to flex upon impact, resulting in the break occurring in the order of furthest board from impact to the closest board (albeit a fraction of a second difference separates each board, making it appear instantaneous). This can be witnessed in many novice demonstrations where the rear board will break, but the remaining top boards are intact. When pegged, the gap between the boards necessitates each individual board to flex and snap before the next board is reached in succession; the person performing the break must physically touch every board in a pegged stack of wood.   Bricks, on the other hand, are ceramic, and snap (or shatter) upon impact, with no flex action. When a stack of bricks is unpegged, the amount of force required to break all of the bricks increases with each additional brick (which is why security barricades are made of solid, not gapped, concrete). When bricks are pegged, the gap created actually allows for the bricks to break each other; the force of the first brick shattering downward through the gap will break the second brick, and so on to a certain degree. Depending on the length, width, and consistency of the material, the larger the gap, the easier the following bricks will break. In essence, the person breaking the bricks does not have to touch every single brick on the way through the stack (again, as witnessed in many demonstrations, a persons hand or foot will not reach the bottom of a stack). To break 2 bricks that are unpegged uses the same power that you would use to break 6-7 bricks with gaps, because when bricks have spacers it only takes 100 pounds of pressure for each brick after the first one being around 700 pounds of pressure for the first brick. [ citation needed ]   Concrete patio blocks, used in most major breaking competitions, require the competitor to ""shock"" the material and drive through from top to bottom. Although spacers help, if the strike is not properly projected the blocks will not carry the force through the entire stack (this can be witnessed at any credible competition).   Spacing of materials in competition is also important to enable a clear winner to be established as the number of stacked items increases. Where as a limit of 5 unspaced patio blocks may be a common sticking point from one competitor to another, a stack of spaced patio blocks can provide more variables, which will narrow the field of competitors. This use of spacers makes competition more dynamic and exciting for competitors and spectators alike.     [ edit ]   Technique   In general, breaking is used both as a method of measuring force of strikes for martial artists, as there was no other way to do this and only recently have devices such as  accelerometers  been used in martial arts, and as a measurement of mental fortitude, the ability of the mind and body to overcome.   Generally, a martial artist engaged in breaking practices hitting something hard.  Masutatsu Oyama , a famous breaker who was known for breaking the horns off bulls, [ citation needed ]  would use trees. In karate, a device called a  makiwara  is used; this device has found more popular use by practitioners of other martial arts today. In the past,  Shaolin  and other earlier martial artists would use many different types of devices in order to condition themselves, not always for simply breaking, but using the same concepts used today. For instance, there is  Iron Palm , Iron Shin,  Iron Shirt , Iron Head, and other types of training which center around conditioning various parts of the body so they could withstand or give blows such as what is seen today in martial arts breaking. Many Chinese systems also are of the school of thought that ""internal energy"" or  Chi  is used when breaking, which is not dependent upon muscle strength and body weight.   The general principles used in martial arts breaking training is similar to the same principles used for most athletics. The body adapts to stress. There are generally three areas a martial arts breaker wishes to force their body to adapt to: the bones, the skin ( calluses ), and muscles (for both mass and speed).   The general principle here  for instance, for the bones  is found in  Wolff's law , which states that the skeletal system will, after healing, be stronger if injury is put to it. In this manner the breaking practitioner operates not unlike a bodybuilder who works out with weights, then takes a period of rest to heal and allow the muscles to come back stronger.   This kind of training is called ""progressive resistance training""; see  Weight training  for more information.   Very often differences in body structure can be seen in the form of calcium deposits between a breaking practitioner and a non-practitioner.   Mike Reeves, a champion breaker, advocates in his book the usage of a makiwara and knuckle  push-ups . With knuckle push-ups, he recommends starting on softer floor material and working your way up to concrete. [ 2 ]   USBA/WBA Founder Drew Serrano, producer of the documentary ""Breaking All Records""  [ 3 ] , encourages practitioners to gradually increase the difficulty and amount of a material to avoid injury. He suggests that beginners should start with wood boards and increase the amount as technical prowess increases. Once a level of comfort, both physically and mentally, is reached, harder materials such as concrete can be attempted.   There are safety concerns with martial arts breaking, so you should seek out an instructor. The knees and elbows, for instance, have weak and small, but essential bones on them. There are many small bones of the foot and hand which need to be very carefully and slowly conditioned for safety. The tendons run over the knuckles on the fist and many damages can result from being overeager and impatient.

Created : 2002-03-29  Modified : 2002-03-29  Version : all  By : John Gruber They run when new mail is downloaded, and when you invoke them by hand with the Re-Apply Filters command.      Why does Mailsmith add a ""Stop Filtering"" action when I make a new filter using the ""Make a Filter"" command? Created : 2002-04-03  Modified : 2002-04-03  Version : 1.5  By : Christian Smith The reason why there is a ""Stop Filtering"" action is this:    Say you have two filters attached to (incoming mail). The first filter transfers a message to mailbox A and the second filter transfers messages to mailbox B and also sets a specific label. Neither filter has a ""Stop Filtering"" action.    Now, if a message comes in which matches both filters, the first filter will transfer it to mailbox A and the second filter will set the messages label. So, a message may fire a second (and third, etc) filter even though a previous filter applied a transfer filter.    Note that the first transfer action always gets applied even if later filters have transfer actions.    By applying a ""Stop Filtering The Message"" action at the end of the filter criteria you avoid this situation and this is why the ""simple filtering"" interface includes this action at the end of each filter it creates.       Why does filters attached to the trash affect incoming mail? Created : 2002-04-21  Modified : 2002-04-21  Version : 1.5  By : Erik Mueller-Harder The trick is that the ""(trash)"" mailbox is in fact the first mailbox whose filters get invoked after the ""(incoming mail)"" mailbox.  Every message that comes in passes through the ""(trash)"" mailbox's filters immediately after any ""(incoming mail)"" filters and before any other mailbox's filters (unless you have a filter with a transfer or a stop-processing action attached to ""(incoming mail)"".     Why doesn't my filters work when I drop email on a mailbox? Created : 2002-04-21  Modified : 2002-04-22  Version : 1.5  By : jem Filters run only when messages are received or you use the ""Re-Apply Filters"" command     How can I delete an arbitarily filter criteria/action? Created :   Modified : 2002-03-25  Version : Pre 1.5  By :  You can delete any criteria/action by option-clicking it and then click ""fewer criteria"" (doesn't seem to work for the first critera).     Can I filter outgoing mail? Created :   Modified : 2002-03-25  Version : Pre 1.5  By :  Yes. Here is a short example of how to do it. Lets say that you want all mails to a certain email address saved in a certain folder. Start by creating a mailfolder to hold the emails, in this case I have called it ""some emailfolder"".     Then create a new filter that matches the email address you want to save. In this case it matches the address ""jem@acm.org"" and the action is to move the email to the folder ""some emailfolder"". Note that this filter is applied  after  the email has been sent.     And finally, attach the filter to the outgoing mailfolder. In this case I choose the folder ""Jan Erik Moström"".       Any tips on filtering out spam? Created :   Modified : 2002-03-25  Version : Pre 1.5  By :  This filter by Rich Siegel is reported to work fairly well.     if  (any header)    contains                authenticated or  From            Matches Grep Pattern    ^#+ or  Has Recipients  Is Not Equal To         True  then          Deposit   Note that for the second term (From Matches Grep Pattern), you need to select ""Match User ID"" from the popup to only match the user ID of the sender.    There's an occasional false positive, but it generally works pretty well, given its simplicity. I've noticed that spammers have been getting more clever lately, and a few more spams slip by; I haven't analyzed them yet, but it should be easy enough to add another term or two.    (Credit where it's due, to Steve Sisak for suggesting the check for ""authenticated"" in the headers.)    Personally I would attach this to the incoming mailbox and as an action do a ""transfer"" to some mailbox   Note that from version 1.5 Mailsmith supports reporting spam using  SpamCop     What does ""is equal to"" really means? Created :   Modified : 2002-03-25  Version : Pre 1.5  By :  When ""is equal to"" is used in a filter like this:     if to is equal to ""fred"" (user id) then    would that be true for both these ""To"" fields or only the first one     To: fred@blabla.com   To: fred@blabla.com, freddy@blabla.com    The answer is that it's true in both cases. You can think of ""to is equal to 'fred'"" as ""any-recipient in the to field is equal to 'fred'""     What does ""Mail Server Name"" match? Created :   Modified : 2002-03-25  Version : Pre 1.5  By :  It matches the name of the POP server, as specified in the account from which the message was downloaded.     How do I match a certain header field? Created :   Modified : 2002-03-25  Version : Pre 1.5  By :  Here is an example of how to match the ""X-Recipient"" field    (Header Text) Matches Grep Pattern ""^X-Recipient: foo@bar\.com""      Can I change the order of how filters are applied? Created :   Modified : 2002-03-26  Version : 1.5  By :  You can change the order of filter execution in a specific mailbox by opening the Mailbox Info window for that mailbox (in v1.5 this command is called ""Edit Attached Filters"") and dragging the filters around.   As of version 1.1.3 the filters are applied in alphabetical order. If you have the following mailboxes:   A B     C     D     E F    The filters attached to mailbox A are first applied to a message, then those in B. If a deposit action is executed in any of the filters in B the filters attached to C, D and E are applied in that order. If there were no deposit action filters attached to F are applied.     Can you give me an example of how to use filters? Created :   Modified : 2002-03-25  Version : Pre 1.5  By :  Say that you have three mailing lists 'listA@someplace.com', 'somelist@somewhere.com' and 'specificlist@somewhere.com' and you want the arrange the mailboxes in the following way   (inbox) My mail Lists    listA mailings    specificlist mailings    somelist mailings    Then you could create the following filter   A: if to is equal to ""myusername@myhost.myisp"" (email address) then deposit B: if to is equal to ""somewhere.com"" (server name) then deposit C: if to is equal to ""somelist"" (user id) then deposit D: if to is equal to ""specificlist"" (user id) then deposit E: if to is equal to ""listA@someplace.com"" (email address) then deposit    Now open the ""Mailbox list"" window or the ""Browser"" window. And then drag&drop filters from the filter window to the mailboxes.   Drag filter A to ""My mail"" Drag filter B to ""Lists"" Drag filter C to ""somelist mailings"" Drag filter D to ""specificlist mailings"" Drag filter E to ""Lists"" Drag filter E to ""listA mailing""    What happens now is that all emails adress to you will be deposited into ""My mail"". The two filters B and E in ""Lists"" will deposit emails from the mailing lists into it and the processing is then continued with the filters in the three mailboxes.     Is there any speed difference between a ""Transfer"" and a ""Deposit""? Created :   Modified : 2002-03-25  Version : Pre 1.5  By :  No.     Does ""A and B or C and D"" equals ""(A and B) or (C and D"")? Created :   Modified : 2002-03-26  Version : 1.5  By :  s this the same thing? The manual seems to indicate this. The answer is ""No"", the manual is incorrect, the criteria are evaluated in a linear fashion with no precedence. So the above would be: (((A and B) or C) and D)                                                  "

Her acting career dated back to the 1960s, when she was a popular teen idol alongside  Connie Chan Po-chu , and  Josephine Siao . Sit recorded many albums in her teens, and later served as a mentor to  Anita Mui , who went on to become one of the biggest superstars in Hong Kong history.   Sit left the entertainment business after she got married and raised a family, but in the early 1990s, her marriage fell apart when her husband left her. Sit was devastated and has said she contemplated suicide. But she thought of her children, which gave her the will to continue with life. She decided to get back into show business and was able to capitalize on the popularity she had achieved as a teen idol, even though it was so many years later.   She first starred in the long-running series  A Kindred Spirit , playing one of the show's central figures. It was the longest-running series in Hong Kong history, with more than 1,000 episodes. Sit's recent work in TVB's TV series made her very popular in Southeast Asia. Sit stars in the sitcoms,  Virtues of Harmony  and its sequel  Virtues of Harmony II . In  Virtues of Harmony , Sit plays a boss of a  Chinese restaurant  in  Ming Dynasty . She reprises a similar role in a modern setting in its sequel,  Virtues of Harmony II .   In 2005, Nancy and co-star  William Hung , were featured in the Hong Kong movie  Where Is Mama's Boy . The accompanying soundtracks included theme songs from the movie that were performed by Nancy, William and Huang Yi-Fei (Wong Yat-Fei).   She also visited several countries, including  Singapore  and  Malaysia , to promote shows in which she performed such as  Kindred Spirit  and to host the  Channel U  variety special.

The  117th  International Olympic Committee  Session  was held for the first time in  Singapore  from  2 July  to  9 July   2005 .

The session was held at the  Raffles City Convention Centre , which is on level 4 of the Raffles City complex. The opening ceremony on  5 July   2005  was held at the  Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay .

[ edit ]   4 July   2005   The Executive Board meetings resume with updates on the progress of preparations for the  2006 Winter Olympics  in  Turin ,  2008 Summer Olympics  in  Beijing  and  2010 Winter Olympics  in  Vancouver  by their respective representatives. The board was informed that Beijing has decided to hold the  equestrian  events in  Hong Kong , as the territory is a disease free zone.     [ edit ]   5 July   2005   The opening ceremony was held at the  Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay  and the guest of honour was the Prime Minister of Singapore,  Lee Hsien Loong  who officially opened the session. A special type of hybrid  orchid  has been bred to commemorate the IOC Session in Singapore and is named Vanda IOC. A cultural performance of dance and songs was held with the theme of ""One Voice, One Rhythm, One World"".     [ edit ]   6 July   2005   See:  2012 Summer Olympics bids  Each of the five bid cities had 45 minutes to make a final presentation to the IOC members, after which voting commenced and the final results were announcenced at 1930 Singapore time with  London  emerging as the bid winner. Local sailor Griselda Khng handed an envelope to IOC president  Jacques Rogge  holding the result of the vote.     [ edit ]   7 July   2005   The final evaluation report of the  2004 Summer Olympics  in  Athens  was presented and the Athens Games were finally closed.     [ edit ]   8 July   2005   The existing 28 sports in the Summer Olympics programme came under scrutiny, three years after a similar attempt failed to gain support from IOC members during the 114th IOC Session in  Mexico City . Prior to the votes,  baseball ,  softball ,  modern pentathlon ,  taekwondo  and  fencing  were considered as most likely to be dropped. Five other sports were vying to get in   golf ,  roller sports ,  squash ,  rugby sevens  and  karate .  Jacques Rogge , president of the IOC, has been supportive of this move, while the  Association of Summer Olympic International Federations  (ASOIF) has been opposing it.   In the morning IOC members voted to remove  baseball  and  softball  from the games (voting was by simple majority), while  modern pentathlon  gained a surprise reprieve. Some nations expressed dismay with the result, in particular the  United States  where both sports originated from, and  Japan , where both have a strong following.   In the afternoon, a secret vote by IOC members gave  squash  and  karate  over 51% of votes, but the addition of a sport requires an amendment to the Olympic Charter, and such an amendment requires a two-thirds majority. Since neither sport achieved that proportion of the votes, no new sports were added and the Olympic Games therefore now consists of 26 sports.   That night at  The Oriental Singapore , when SNOC president and defence minister,  Teo Chee Hean  threw a banquet, Rogge gave Singapore full marks for the session organisation, a perfect 6.     [ edit ]   9 July   2005   Singapore's IOC member,  Ng Ser Miang  was vying for a spot in the IOC Executive Board to replace  Greek   Lambis Nikolaou , whose term ended on this day. Ng Ser Miang was shortlisted together with  Ivan Dibos  from  Peru . Ng Ser Miang was elected to the Board, and two vice presidents were also elected   Lambis Nikolaou  and  Chiharu Igaya , an IOC member from  Japan .     [ edit ]   World's Impression of Singapore   A  Canadian  television report said that the session had placed the country in the centre of the sporting universe and that the spotlight was on six cities  not just the five candidate cities.   The media amusingly said that most visitors' first taste of  Singapore  is an annoying ""ding-dong"" alert sound produced in a  taxi  when it exceeds the speed limit ( Reuters ). The speaking of the slang  Singlish  was highlighted, together with the country's  chewing gum laws . The  UK's   The Sunday Telegraph  said ""So who is going to win? With so many possible permutations, predicting the result is about as futile as looking for a pack of chewing gum in Singapore.""  The New York Times  suggested to the mayor,  Michael Bloomberg  ""If the Mayor seeks a distraction from his Olympics defeat by looking for something new to ban, he could do worse than to follow the Singapore tradition by hounding gum-chewers as he did smokers.""   The  Americans  were alerted to a US State Department advisory that told travellers to treat the nations rules on jaywalking and littering with respect. A  New York   tabloid  published a whole list of the dos and do nots of the island. The case of  Michael Fay  also surfaced with the New York Times adding that ""doesn't a tiny part of you wish the police could get really tough with those who defile the sidewalks with litter and spit? What do you think the odds are that the young Ohio man will ever vandalise the car again. ""   References, grudging or not, were made to Singapore's lush greenery, the ""tough"" drug laws, the ""rare"" traffic jams and the tight security checks. The  British  daily,  The Guardian  wrote on the terrorism spectre that stalks the Games, noting that, ""Even here in Singapore, during the meeting of the 116 members, security has at times been stifling. Access to the  Swisstel , where the members are staying , has been severely restricted and squadrons of  Gurkhas  armed with hand- and machine-guns patrol inside and outside the hotel.""     [ edit ]   Media Confusion   There was some kind of confusion by the foreign newspapers mixing up the high end  Raffles Hotel  with the  Raffles City .  Reuters  wrote ""It is a national monument, the jewel in Singapore's crown, and this week, Raffles Hotel will becoming a bubbling cauldron of lobbying and politics as it stages the most keenly-contested Olympic venue vote in the history of the Games. Its Colonial style salons and parlours will be overrun by bid officials and consultants, celebrities and spin-doctors."" Later, it clarified that the vote was actually at the adjacent  Raffles City Convention Centre  and not the hotel.   British paper,  The Guardian , in a report on the London team isolating themselves on  Sentosa  wrote, ""They have deliberately retreated from the hothouse atmosphere of the Raffles Hotel complex, the venue for the IOC congress, to perfect a final pitch they believe will be crucial in gathering the votes London requires to win.""   The  Weekend Australian  reported, ""First order of the business that day at Raffles Hotel will be determining whether any changes are to be made to the Olympic programme......""  The Bangkok Post  said, ""Members of the International Olympic Committee from around the globe will meet  July 6 - 9  at the historic Raffles Hotel to pick the hosts of the 2012 Games of the Olympiad.""     [ edit ]   Olympic Anthem criticism   The trio who sung the  Olympic Anthem  in  Greek  was criticised by both the media and the audience. They were Singaporean soprano Khor Ai Ming, Singaporean tenor William Lim and  Japanese  soprano Satsuki Nagatome. The trio sung with gusto just before the announcement of the  2012 Summer Olympics .   The feedback on their pre-recorded performance was not music to the ears. The Guardian reported on their operatic rendition ""Two Singaporean sopranos and a tenor dressed like a matre d' subjected the Olympic anthem, a tune whose primary virtue is to be heard only once every four years, to a fearful mauling."" [ 1 ]   The Times  of the UK described them as ""three Orientals... one distinctly off key"". [ citation needed ]  Khor said that feedback from the IOC was good. [ citation needed ]  The trio were picked by the show's producer and performed on the anthem the day before at Esplanade at the opening ceremony. A poll conducted in the nation said the rendition was embarrassing. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Impact   The  Singapore  government has made a profit of  S$  40 million from holding the session.             Please help  improve this section  by expanding it.

In a broad sense, it means all  defensive walls , including the  Great Wall of China , as well as similar structures in other countries such as  Hadrian's Wall . In a narrow sense, Chengqiang specifically refers to defensive walls built around a city or town.   In  classical Chinese , the character  Chng  () denoted the defensive wall of the ""inner city"", housing government buildings. The character  Gu  () denoted the defensive wall of the ""outer city"", housing mainly residences. The phrase Chngchng (), literally ""the Long Wall"", specifically referred to the  Great Wall .     [ edit ]   History          A fortified gatehouse leading into a city, perhaps  Kaifeng , from the early 12th century  Song  painting  Along the River During the Qingming Festival  by  Zhang Zeduan  (10851145)       Like various other innovations in  Chinese history , the invention of the city wall is attributed to a semi-mythological sage; in this case, to  Xia Dynasty  leader Gun (), the father of  Yu the Great [ 1 ] . It is said that Gun built the inner wall () to defend the prince, and the outer wall () to settle the people. An alternative theory attributes the first city wall to the  Yellow Emperor [ 2 ] . A number of neolithic-period walls surrounding substantial settlements have been excavated in recent years. These include a stone wall at  Sanxingdui , and several tamped earth walls at the  Longshan culture  site. These walls generally protected settlements the size of a large village.   In  Shang Dynasty   China , at the site of Ao, large walls were erected in the 15th century BC that had dimensions of 20 meters / 65 feet in width at the base and enclosed an area of some 2,100 yards (1,900 m) squared. [ 3 ]  In similar dimensions, the ancient capital of the  State of Zhao ,  Handan  (founded in 386 BC), had walls that were again 20 meters / 65 feet wide at the base, a height of 15 meters / 50 feet tall, with two separate sides of its rectangular enclosure measured at a length of 1,530 yards (1,400 m). [ 3 ]          Eroded section of  Nanjing  city wall       Most towns of a significant size possessed a city wall from the  Zhou Dynasty  onwards. For example, the city wall of  Pingyao  were first constructed between 827 BC and 782 BC, in the reign of  King Xuan of Zhou . The city wall of  Suzhou  followed, prior to their demolition in the 1960s and 1970s, largely the same plan as set down by  Wu Zixu  in the 5th century BC. By the  Yuan Dynasty , it was government policy that towns which were administrative seats of  county -level units or above were to have defensive walls. In ancient China, sieges of city walls (along with naval battles) were portrayed on  bronze  'hu' vessels dated to the  Warring States  (5th century BC to 3rd century BC), like those found in  Chengdu ,  Sichuan , China in 1965. [ 4 ]   The construction of city walls grew to a peak in the  Ming Dynasty  and  Qing Dynasty . Sophisticated construction techniques meant that major city walls, such as that in the capitals  Beijing  and  Nanjing , were specifically built to withstand cannonfire. However, with the advent of modern Western firearms, traditional fortifications began to lose their defensive functions in the 19th and 20th centuries. The traditional city wall also proved an obstacle to efficient trade and intercourse. For example, the city wall of  Shanghai , built to repel  Wokou  raiders in the  Ming dynasty , was almost completely demolished after the  Xinhai Revolution  at the request of the city's merchant community.   After the founding of the  People's Republic of China , a political dimension was added to the economic problem posed by city walls. In  Beijing , for example, the proposed demolition of the city walls was at first opposed by experts ranging from architect  Liang Sicheng , to  Soviet  advisor Mosin, on the grounds that the city walls of Beijing were the most sophisticated and well-preserved system of city walls in China. However, in 1958  Mao Zedong  intervened, and declared that the demolition of the old city wall was a political issue. Despite mayor  Peng Zhen 's efforts to preserve gates and towers, by 1970 almost all of the city wall had been demolished.     [ edit ]   Composition           Meridian Gate , the front entrance to the  Forbidden City , with two protruding wings.       Many Chinese cities were deliberately sited and planned, city walls tend to be rectangular or square instead of being constrained by geography. Philosophical and even  feng shui  considerations were adopted in siting gates and towers, and the walled city itself.   Chinese cities rarely centre on a  castle . Instead, the city's administrative centre is spread over a relatively large area, which may or may not be surrounded by a second set of ""inner"" walls similar in shape and construction to the main, outer wall.          Plan of the walls of the ancient city of Beijing.              Horse ramp of  Gate of China ,  Nanjing              Archery Tower of the  Qianmen  Gate, the front gate of  Beijing ; rebuilt in 1914 with the additions for cannon placements              The Northeast corner tower of the  Forbidden City               Panmen Gate  in  Suzhou , a combined land-and-water gate       Long-term strategic considerations adopted in the planning process also meant that the walls of important cities often enclosed an area much larger than the existing urban areas, both in order to ensure excess capacity for growth, and to secure resources such as timber and farmland in times of war. Thus, for example, the city wall of  Quanzhou  in  Fujian  still contained one quarter vacant land by 1945. The city wall of  Suzhou  by the  Republic of China  era still contained large tracts of farmland [ 5 ] . The  City Wall of Nanjing , built in the  Ming Dynasty , enclosed an area large enough to house an airport, bamboo forests, and lakes in modern times [ 6 ] .   Several features are typical of most Chinese city walls.     [ edit ]   Shape   Where allowed by geography, Chinese city walls are rectangular in shape, with four orthogonal walls. Some wall systems are composed of a number of such rectangles, set adjacent to or concentrically within each other. For example, the city wall of  Beijing  is composed of four rectangles: a wider outer city to the south, a narrower inner city to the north, an  imperial city  within the inner city, and the  Forbidden City  at the centre of that.   The walls could be constructed of a variety of materials. Common materials included  rammed earth ,  compressed earth blocks , brick, stone, and any combination of these. In its standardised form during the  Ming  and  Qing  dynasties, the wall was composed of a core made of compressed earth and mixed debris, strengthened by various  binders . The wall was then surfaced with bricks. It was topped with  crenellations  facing out, and a  parapet  facing in.     [ edit ]   Gates   Gates were placed symmetrically along the walls. The principal gate was traditionally located at the centre of the south wall. Gatehouses were generally built of  wood and brick , which sat atop a raised and expanded section of the wall, surrounded by crenellated battlements. A tunnel ran under the gatehouse, with several metal grates and wooden doors.  Camouflaged  defensive positions are placed along the tunnel (in an effect similar to  murder holes ). Gatehouses were accessed by ramps, called horse ramps or bridle paths [ 7 ]  , ( Chinese :   ;  pinyin : mdo), which sat against the wall adjacent to the gate.     [ edit ]   Barbican   An ""archery tower"" was often placed in front of the main gatehouse, forming a  barbican  ({{zh-cpl|c=|p=wngchngIn its final form during the  Ming  and [[Qing Dynasty dynasties, the archery tower was an elaborate construction, of comparable height to the main gatehouse, which stands some distance in front of the main gatehouse. At its base was a gate. The archery tower is so-named because of its rows of archery (and later cannon) placements, from which defenders could fire projectiles on attackers. Auxiliary walls, running perpendicularly to the main wall, connect the archery tower with the main gatehouse, enclosing a rectangular area. This area serves as a buffer zone, should the first gate be breached. Its  Chinese  name, ""jar walls"", refers to the intended strategy whereby attackers coming through the archery tower would be trapped in the barbican, open to attack from all sides.   In large gates there may be multiple barbicans - the main gate of Nanjing had three barbicans, forming the most elaborate system still in existence in China.     [ edit ]   Towers   Towers  that protruded from the wall were located at regular intervals along the wall. Large and elaborate towers, called corner towers (), were placed where two walls joined (i.e. at corners). These were significantly higher than the wall itself, and gave defenders a bird's eye view over both the city and its surroundings.     [ edit ]   Moat   In larger cities, a  moat  surrounded the wall. This could be connected to canals or rivers both in the city and outside, thus providing both a defense and a convenient transportation route. Nearby waterways might be adopted or altered to connect to, or form part of, the moat.

It is said that Gun built the inner wall () to defend the prince, and the outer wall () to settle the people. An alternative theory attributes the first city wall to the  Yellow Emperor [ 2 ] . A number of neolithic-period walls surrounding substantial settlements have been excavated in recent years. These include a stone wall at  Sanxingdui , and several tamped earth walls at the  Longshan culture  site. These walls generally protected settlements the size of a large village.   In  Shang Dynasty   China , at the site of Ao, large walls were erected in the 15th century BC that had dimensions of 20 meters / 65 feet in width at the base and enclosed an area of some 2,100 yards (1,900 m) squared. [ 3 ]  In similar dimensions, the ancient capital of the  State of Zhao ,  Handan  (founded in 386 BC), had walls that were again 20 meters / 65 feet wide at the base, a height of 15 meters / 50 feet tall, with two separate sides of its rectangular enclosure measured at a length of 1,530 yards (1,400 m). [ 3 ]          Eroded section of  Nanjing  city wall       Most towns of a significant size possessed a city wall from the  Zhou Dynasty  onwards. For example, the city wall of  Pingyao  were first constructed between 827 BC and 782 BC, in the reign of  King Xuan of Zhou . The city wall of  Suzhou  followed, prior to their demolition in the 1960s and 1970s, largely the same plan as set down by  Wu Zixu  in the 5th century BC. By the  Yuan Dynasty , it was government policy that towns which were administrative seats of  county -level units or above were to have defensive walls. In ancient China, sieges of city walls (along with naval battles) were portrayed on  bronze  'hu' vessels dated to the  Warring States  (5th century BC to 3rd century BC), like those found in  Chengdu ,  Sichuan , China in 1965. [ 4 ]   The construction of city walls grew to a peak in the  Ming Dynasty  and  Qing Dynasty . Sophisticated construction techniques meant that major city walls, such as that in the capitals  Beijing  and  Nanjing , were specifically built to withstand cannonfire. However, with the advent of modern Western firearms, traditional fortifications began to lose their defensive functions in the 19th and 20th centuries. The traditional city wall also proved an obstacle to efficient trade and intercourse. For example, the city wall of  Shanghai , built to repel  Wokou  raiders in the  Ming dynasty , was almost completely demolished after the  Xinhai Revolution  at the request of the city's merchant community.   After the founding of the  People's Republic of China , a political dimension was added to the economic problem posed by city walls. In  Beijing , for example, the proposed demolition of the city walls was at first opposed by experts ranging from architect  Liang Sicheng , to  Soviet  advisor Mosin, on the grounds that the city walls of Beijing were the most sophisticated and well-preserved system of city walls in China. However, in 1958  Mao Zedong  intervened, and declared that the demolition of the old city wall was a political issue. Despite mayor  Peng Zhen 's efforts to preserve gates and towers, by 1970 almost all of the city wall had been demolished.     [ edit ]   Composition           Meridian Gate , the front entrance to the  Forbidden City , with two protruding wings.       Many Chinese cities were deliberately sited and planned, city walls tend to be rectangular or square instead of being constrained by geography. Philosophical and even  feng shui  considerations were adopted in siting gates and towers, and the walled city itself.   Chinese cities rarely centre on a  castle . Instead, the city's administrative centre is spread over a relatively large area, which may or may not be surrounded by a second set of ""inner"" walls similar in shape and construction to the main, outer wall.

Horse ramp of  Gate of China ,  Nanjing              Archery Tower of the  Qianmen  Gate, the front gate of  Beijing ; rebuilt in 1914 with the additions for cannon placements              The Northeast corner tower of the  Forbidden City               Panmen Gate  in  Suzhou , a combined land-and-water gate       Long-term strategic considerations adopted in the planning process also meant that the walls of important cities often enclosed an area much larger than the existing urban areas, both in order to ensure excess capacity for growth, and to secure resources such as timber and farmland in times of war. Thus, for example, the city wall of  Quanzhou  in  Fujian  still contained one quarter vacant land by 1945. The city wall of  Suzhou  by the  Republic of China  era still contained large tracts of farmland [ 5 ] . The  City Wall of Nanjing , built in the  Ming Dynasty , enclosed an area large enough to house an airport, bamboo forests, and lakes in modern times [ 6 ] .   Several features are typical of most Chinese city walls.     [ edit ]   Shape   Where allowed by geography, Chinese city walls are rectangular in shape, with four orthogonal walls. Some wall systems are composed of a number of such rectangles, set adjacent to or concentrically within each other. For example, the city wall of  Beijing  is composed of four rectangles: a wider outer city to the south, a narrower inner city to the north, an  imperial city  within the inner city, and the  Forbidden City  at the centre of that.   The walls could be constructed of a variety of materials. Common materials included  rammed earth ,  compressed earth blocks , brick, stone, and any combination of these. In its standardised form during the  Ming  and  Qing  dynasties, the wall was composed of a core made of compressed earth and mixed debris, strengthened by various  binders . The wall was then surfaced with bricks. It was topped with  crenellations  facing out, and a  parapet  facing in.     [ edit ]   Gates   Gates were placed symmetrically along the walls. The principal gate was traditionally located at the centre of the south wall. Gatehouses were generally built of  wood and brick , which sat atop a raised and expanded section of the wall, surrounded by crenellated battlements. A tunnel ran under the gatehouse, with several metal grates and wooden doors.  Camouflaged  defensive positions are placed along the tunnel (in an effect similar to  murder holes ). Gatehouses were accessed by ramps, called horse ramps or bridle paths [ 7 ]  , ( Chinese :   ;  pinyin : mdo), which sat against the wall adjacent to the gate.     [ edit ]   Barbican   An ""archery tower"" was often placed in front of the main gatehouse, forming a  barbican  ({{zh-cpl|c=|p=wngchngIn its final form during the  Ming  and [[Qing Dynasty dynasties, the archery tower was an elaborate construction, of comparable height to the main gatehouse, which stands some distance in front of the main gatehouse. At its base was a gate. The archery tower is so-named because of its rows of archery (and later cannon) placements, from which defenders could fire projectiles on attackers. Auxiliary walls, running perpendicularly to the main wall, connect the archery tower with the main gatehouse, enclosing a rectangular area. This area serves as a buffer zone, should the first gate be breached. Its  Chinese  name, ""jar walls"", refers to the intended strategy whereby attackers coming through the archery tower would be trapped in the barbican, open to attack from all sides.   In large gates there may be multiple barbicans - the main gate of Nanjing had three barbicans, forming the most elaborate system still in existence in China.     [ edit ]   Towers   Towers  that protruded from the wall were located at regular intervals along the wall. Large and elaborate towers, called corner towers (), were placed where two walls joined (i.e. at corners). These were significantly higher than the wall itself, and gave defenders a bird's eye view over both the city and its surroundings.     [ edit ]   Moat   In larger cities, a  moat  surrounded the wall. This could be connected to canals or rivers both in the city and outside, thus providing both a defense and a convenient transportation route. Nearby waterways might be adopted or altered to connect to, or form part of, the moat.
