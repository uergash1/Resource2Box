GX257-30-11381173	"Central California Bay Area residential rents are down, but the cost of buying a house keeps going up. Is there any logic behind this inconsistency? Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C. said the growing gap supports his theory that home prices are artificially high. Baker said ""Economic fundamentals should be having roughly the same effect on rents as house prices."" He urged homeowners to brace themselves for a valuation collapse of as much as 30 percent. However, some economists reconcile falling rents and rising house prices by noting that high home prices increased rental demand when new arrivals came during the boom times of the 90s. When the boom ended, homeowners hung on, but tenants moved out and the rental market took the brunt of the drop. RealFacts, a Bay Area market data firm, says the recent average monthly rent was $1,283 for apartments with a vacancy rate of 5.9 percent. A year ago the average rent was $1,337, and the vacancy rate 6.3 percent. In the East Bay, the recent vacancy rate of 5.2 percent was up more than 6 times the 0.8 percent rate in the 2nd quarter of 2000. In contrast, the median price of a Bay Area home reached an all-time high in November of $455,000, according to DataQuick Information Services. The whole story is at: http://www.contracostatimes.com/mld/cctimes/business/7768940.htm. Southern California Manufacturing is looking up according to Chapman University's Purchasing Managers' Survey for the 4th Quarter of 2003. The survey points to a strong recovery in California's manufacturing sector in 2004 as it marks two consecutive increases in the Composite Index and the reported index values of over 60 for these two quarters indicate significant improvement in manufacturing. The Composite index increased from 63.2 in the third quarter to 63.9 in the fourth quarter of 2003. The seasonally adjusted index for production rose from 69.0 in the third quarter of 2003 to 69.2 in the fourth quarter. Printing and related support activities; nonmetallic mineral products; machinery; electrical equipment; appliance and components; furniture and related products; computer and electronic products; and aerospace products and parts posted the strongest production growth in the fourth quarter. No industry reported a production decrease over the quarter. Despite a continuing decline in manufacturing jobs in Los Angeles County, the region still leads the nation in factory jobs. Even though Los Angeles County has lost 16 percent of its factory jobs since 2000, it still has more jobs than that ""Second City"" - Chicago. Many experts thought Chicago had passed Los Angeles in manufacturing employment during 2001, but last year's industrial coding changes, especially moving printing from manufacturing to information, solidified Los Angeles' spot as the top-manufacturing center in the nation. Los Angeles County posted an annual average of 511,000 manufacturing jobs in 2003, while Chicago supported 479,000 jobs. California led all states in manufacturing employment with 1.6 million factory jobs in 2003, followed by Texas with 917,000.   California Regional Bulletin (continued) Northern California Underscoring the need for health care workers, health care replaced technology as Sacramento's largest employer last year. The Sacramento Business Journal's annual ranking of the region's largest private sector employers saw Sutter Health and Kaiser Permanente move up to the number two and three spots in the county behind Raley's Supermarkets. Raley's has 7,340 employees and Sutter and Kaiser both employ over 7,000 workers, moving them ahead of Intel Corporation, which fell to number four with 7,000 employees. Hewlett-Packard, once one of the top three has fallen to number seven with 4,000 workers, while Mercy Healthcare with over 6,500 employees moved up to number five. Hewlett-Packard (H-P), Earthlink and Oracle all recently announced payroll reductions in the Sacramento Region. H-P employs 4,000 workers now, but has already cut about 2,000 jobs over the last two years at their Roseville campus. They announced they will close an information technology help desk and eliminated 120 jobs filled by people working for a subcontractor, Volt Services Group. This follows recent layoffs by Oracle, which is shifting 175 back office and call center jobs from their Rocklin site to India. Earthlink's plans to close their Roseville call center that employs 450 workers. Ed Graves, the Director of Placer County Economic Development, said that the cost of doing business in California is sending a majority of these jobs out. Business is booming for Crescent City crab fishermen, but not only for the reasons most people expected. Last year, the National Marine Fisheries bought out most of the large fishing trawlers on the North Coast. Locals feared that would mean an end to the fishing industry. When the season opened, the remaining small and mid-sized commercial boat owners wondered if the buyout of all but one of Crescent City's largest boats would curtail the crab catch and the money and jobs that come with it. Surprisingly, the crustaceans have been plentiful and the market has been good, partly because all but two of the owners who sold their vessels for about an average of $500,000 have leased other boats and continue to fish. If you live in Marysville or Yuba City and feel stress, you're not alone. Sperling's Best Places crunched the numbers for 331 metro areas, looking at stress factors such as suicide and divorce rates, commute times, and unemployment. Yuba-Sutter came in as the most stressful area out of 117 with a population of under 200,000 people. This continues a roller coaster ride for a region that Rand McNally rated as the worst metropolitan area in American in the 1980s before Forbes Magazine voted Yuba/Sutter the ""best small metro for doing business"" in 2001. Sperling noted that most of all, the employment situation is a challenge. Yuba City MSA has double-digit unemployment rates year round and is traditionally in the top three areas for the highest unemployment rate in California. In November 2003, Yuba-Sutter had the fifth highest unemployment rate among small metro areas in the United States according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The measure is used extensively for economic analysis and policy formulation in both the public and private sectors, and for escalation of contract amounts and other payments among individuals and organizations. The CPI also has a significant impact on the finances of the Federal Government. It is used to adjust payments to Social Security recipients, to Federal and military retirees, and for a number of entitlement programs such as food stamps and school lunches. An increase in the CPI increases Federal statutory obligations for these payments and programs. In addition, individual income tax brackets and personal exemptions are adjusted for inflation using the CPI. In this case, an increase in the CPI results in lower tax revenues. It is estimated, for example, that in fiscal year 1996, each 1-percent increase in the index produced a $5.7 billion increase in outlays and a $2.5 billion decline in revenues. 1   To maintain the accuracy of the CPI, an updating of the index is undertaken approximately every 10 years. The most fundamental and visible activity in each of these CPI revisions is the introduction of a new ""market basket,"" or set of expenditure weights attached to the categories of goods and services comprising the CPI. Because the next market basket introduction will occur in January 1998, the current revision effort is usually identified as the 1998 CPI revision. Revisions of the CPI are comprehensive, multiyear efforts, however, and the current revision is planned to be completed over a 6-year period ending in 2000. The projects and changes encompassed in the current revision—the sixth major revision in the CPI’s history—range from the reselection and reclassification of areas, items, and outlets, to the development of new systems for data collection and processing. This article provides a general description of those projects and changes, and directs the reader to additional articles in this issue for more in-depth treatment of several topics.   About revisions   Context .  The CPI is a measure of price change for a fixed market basket of goods and services of constant quantity and quality purchased for consumption. 2  Consumers change their purchasing patterns in response to a myriad of factors, including relative price changes, real income changes, the introduction of new product distribution patterns and marketing techniques, population and other demographic changes, and changes in consumer preferences. The CPI samples and weights are updated during revisions to reflect these marketplace changes, because without such updates the index would cease to be an accurate measure of current price inflation. The technological improvements undertaken during CPI revisions also contribute to improved accuracy by making possible more and faster data collection, with fewer errors.   It is important to note, however, that numerous methodological improvements in the CPI have taken place outside the revision framework. Among the most prominent examples of these are the annual adjustment for changes in the quality of new cars after model changeovers introduced in 1967, the shift to flow-of-services measures of the cost of owner-occupied housing in the early 1980s, and the implementation of regression-based methods for quality adjustment of apparel prices starting in 1991.  Exhibit 1  presents a chronology of some of these changes. Also outside the context of decennial revisions, the CPI program develops experimental indexes of consumer prices corresponding to population subgroups or using alternative aggregation formulas. One example of such an experimental index is the CPI-E, an index based on the expenditure patterns of consumer units with reference persons aged 62 or older. 3  Another index, currently under development, uses a geometric mean formula to average the prices of items within CPI product categories. 4  Recently, the Bureau has begun an evaluation effort to determine whether this geometric mean formula should be adopted, in full or in part, in the official CPI.    This current revision occurs at a time of heightened public scrutiny of the CPI. As mentioned above, CPI movements have a major influence on Federal revenues and expenditures. Largely for this reason, issues relating to the accuracy of the CPI have gained the attention of observers both inside and outside of government. 5  Most notably, following hearings in the spring of 1995, the Senate Finance Committee appointed an advisory commission to study the CPI and make recommendations for methodological improvements. 6     One source of upward bias that has been of particular concern since its discovery by BLS researchers was a technical problem that tied the weight of a CPI sample item to its expected price change. This flaw was effectively eliminated by the 1995 and 1996 changes to CPI sample rotation and substitution procedures and to the functional form used to calculate changes in the cost of shelter for homeowners. 7  Numerous issues remain, however, all generally resulting from the dynamic nature of U.S. consumer markets—new goods, new types of outlets, increases or decreases in product quality, and consumer substitution behavior—and the difficulty of completely reflecting such changes in the CPI. It is generally recognized that the identification of solutions to most of these issues will require much additional research. The 1998 revision, therefore, is not designed to be a solution to, or even BLS response to, issues of potential bias. Nevertheless, some components of the revision are relevant to those issues.   Substitution bias, for example, should be mitigated by the updating of CPI weights and samples. The CPI, as a fixed-weighted index, generally overstates changes in what economists call a true cost-of-living index, because consumers can substitute toward categories of goods and services whose relative prices have fallen. Elimination of this bias would require the use of an alternative formula for aggregating individual item indexes. The BLS produces experimental U.S.-level indexes using such ""superlative"" formulas, 8  and research to enhance the accuracy of these indexes is continuing. The data requirements of superlative formulas limit the potential for their use in the official monthly CPI. It is reasonable to expect, however, that the incorporation of more up-to-date expenditure weights in 1998 will reduce the potential gap between the official CPI and an index that fully reflects current consumer spending patterns and responses. The updating of the CPI geographic and housing samples should work in the same direction.   The process of incorporating new goods and new outlets into the CPI will be enhanced by several aspects of the revision. First, the redefinition of item categories is designed to facilitate the introduction of wholly new types of goods and services that might not have fit neatly into the existing CPI item structure. Second, new item and outlet samples will be introduced in the geographic areas that are new to the CPI, and in several item categories that have been extensively redefined. The most important of the latter categories is the hospital services component of the CPI, where a new structuring of the index is specifically designed to better reflect rapidly changing technology and treatment patterns. Third, as part of the revision, the CPI’s sample rotation procedures are being redesigned to permit the accelerated introduction of new items and outlets in those product markets characterized by the most rapid change.   History .  The CPI was developed during World War I to meet the need of the Federal Government in establishing cost-of-living adjustments for workers in shipbuilding centers. Rapid increases in prices made such an index essential for calculating these cost-of-living adjustments. Regular publication of a national index began in 1921, based on the prices of 145 selected items in 32 industrial cities and expenditure patterns corresponding to the 1917–19 period. 9  Since that time, the Bureau has updated, or revised, the CPI five times.  Exhibit 2  shows the dates for each of the past revisions, and the period of time during which expenditure patterns were collected to provide the weights for the goods and services that comprise the market basket. Consumer spending patterns during 1982–84, for example, have formed the basis for the CPI weighting structure since January 1987. Effective with publication of CPI data for January 1998, movements in the index will be based on 1993–95 consumer expenditures.   Although reselecting and reweighting the items in the CPI sample is fundamental to the revision process, each historical revision has brought important methodological innovations that improved the accuracy and representativeness of the index. The 1940 revision, for example, in addition to updating expenditure weights because people’s buying patterns had changed substantially since the 1917–19 period, introduced the concept of a sample of cities and items as well as the principle that the priced items could be used to impute the price movement of similar non-priced items. Based on this, the Bureau was able to publish price indexes for categories of items, rather than for separate distinguished items.   During World War II, when many commodities were scarce and goods were rationed, the index weights were adjusted temporarily to reflect those shortages. The first comprehensive postwar revision was completed in January 1953, using weights from an expenditure survey conducted in 1950. Both medium-sized and small cities were added to the city sample to make the index representative of prices paid by all urban wage earner and clerical worker families. 10   After the 1953 revision, it became apparent that the CPI needed to be revised every decade. 11  As a result, the next revision was completed in 1964. For the first time, the expenditure weights included single persons as well as families. In addition, computer processing was used for the first time in the 1964 revision. 12   The 1978 CPI revision implemented a variety of fundamental changes, many of which were stimulated by the 1961 report of the Price Statistics Review Committee headed by future Nobel Prize winner George J. Stigler. 13  The revision introduced a quarterly survey approach to the collection of consumer expenditures as well as numerous improvements and innovations in pricing for the CPI. Additionally, 1978 saw the introduction of a second index of consumer prices, a more broadly-based CPI for All Urban Consumers, or CPI-U. This index differed from the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) by including the buying patterns of all urban households regardless of the consumer units’ occupational status.    The sampling process of the CPI also moved to a more comprehensive and sophisticated statistical basis in 1978. A new store-specific approach to the item selection process, called disaggregation, was introduced. Perhaps the most significant innovation in the 1978 revision was the introduction of the Point-of-Purchase Survey (POPS). In the POPS, consumer units were interviewed in each geographic area covered in the CPI. Respondents identified the actual stores and other retail outlets in which they shopped and specified the amount they spent for a category of items.   The most recent revision was completed in 1987 and updated the CPI to 1982–84 expenditure patterns. Unlike previous revisions in which all new areas and items were replaced at the same time, the 1987 revision introduced the concept of ""rolling-in."" New areas, items, and outlet samples were gradually introduced over a period of years using existing updating procedures. 14  The use of systematic sample rotation was also broadened. 15  Finally, the 1987 revision introduced the use of an advanced model for CPI sample allocation. The model uses nonlinear programming techniques to determine the distributions of item and outlet selections across all item and geographic strata and to minimize overall price change sampling variance subject to certain budgetary and operational constraints.   The 1998 revision   The most basic aspect of this revision will be the incorporation of a new set of expenditure weights. Consumer Expenditure Survey data from 1993–95 will be used to calculate a new expenditure weight for each item strata category in every CPI index area. These new market baskets—new geographic area samples, new item structure, and new expenditure weights—will take effect with the index for January 1998. At the same time, many of the samples underlying the CPI will be replaced. These samples include geographic areas, items selected for pricing, and outlets in which items are priced.   Geographic sample .  The geographic sample selection process uses stratified sampling to represent the U.S. urban population. Eighty-seven geographic areas, known as primary sampling units, were selected for the revised CPI based on the 1990 decennial census. These units replace the current primary sampling units, which are representative of the 1980 U.S. population distribution. Thirty primary sampling units where prices are currently collected, including Anchorage and Honolulu, were selected with certainty. Another 21 units in the current design were also selected again. Thirty-six new primary sampling units were selected to replace units in the current CPI geographic sample. These 36 new areas will have new outlet and item pricing samples introduced into the revised index for January 1998. As part of the reselection process, the present three metropolitan-area size categories will be consolidated into two. Details on the redesigned CPI geographic sample and the procedures used to select that sample are in  ""The redesign of the CPI geographic sample .""    Item structure .  As the geographic sample must reflect today’s population, the CPI market basket needs to be updated to represent current consumption patterns. The item strata (the groupings of items into homogeneous categories for publication) will be redefined and the way in which they are aggregated will change based on shifts taking place in the marketplace. For example, the present seven major groups of goods and services will be restructured into eight major groups with the creation of the ‘education and communication’ group. That new group includes components previously included in the ‘housing’ and ‘other goods and services’groups. The new item structure, along with a summary of the assumptions underlying the development of the new structure, are in  ""Changing the item structure of the Consumer Price Index.""     The selection of commodities and services samples during the revision will benefit from the results of an expanded and re-estimated CPI sample optimization model. As compared with the models used in earlier years, the new design will lead to the selection of relatively fewer outlets and more items per outlet. Also, there will be a broad shift in relative sample size away from the food and beverages category and toward the other major groups. These changes occur largely because updated and improved variance estimates were used in the estimation of the optimization model, and additional sample share constraints were imposed. 16     Publication strategy .  The selection of new geographic areas and modernization of the item structure will necessarily result in changes in the number and mix of published CPI series. In addition, during the revision, the publication criteria and procedures have been reviewed extensively. BLS will develop a variance-based publication strategy in which the level of detail published is based on the variance surrounding its item index estimates.    As in the past, the Bureau will publish overlap indexes based on both the new and the old item structure and expenditure weight for several months beginning in February 1998. These overlap indexes will permit users to see first-hand the revision’s effect on the published rate of inflation. Also, effective with the index for January 1999, the CPI will change from a 1982–84 = 100 to a 1993–95 = 100 reference base. Details on the new CPI publication system and structure are in  ""Publication strategy for the 1998 revised Consumer Price Index.""   Housing .  The housing portion of the CPI revision has two fundamental components, both of which will be implemented with the index for January 1999:  the shift to an improved estimation method for homeowner shelter costs, and the selection of a new housing unit sample using the 1990 decennial census. The new estimator for owners’ equivalent rent will be based on the reweighting of the same rental observations that are used for the residential rent index. In the current CPI estimator, implicit rents for a sample of owner-occupied units are estimated by matching those units to specific rental units. The new method will not require selection of an owner-occupied sample.   This new sample will provide a current set of rental housing units that, as noted above, will be priced to calculate indexes for both residential rent and owners’ equivalent rent. The decennial census provides information that will be used to select the ‘housing’ segments within geographic areas. This selection process utilizes stratification criteria to locate segments that represent the housing stock throughout the geographic area, and also determines the sampling rates that will be used to derive the appropriate total sample of housing units. Housing units will be selected to support the initial revised sample, as well as the shadow samples that will be rotated into the CPI in later years to reduce respondent burden and refresh the sample. In addition, new housing units constructed since the decennial census will be brought into the CPI housing sample through an augmentation process. Additional information on the changes to the housing component of the CPI is in  ""Revision of the CPI housing sample and estimators.""     Hospital services .  The medical care component of the CPI also will be extensively revised to reflect the dramatic changes taking place in this sector of the economy, particularly in the delivery of hospital services. Effective with the index for January 1997, the three item strata within the hospital and related services category will be consolidated into two, with only a single hospital services stratum. Pricing procedures are also being fundamentally revised, from pricing individual items (such as a unit of blood or a hospital inpatient day) to pricing the combined sets of goods and services provided on selected patient bills. These changes support the collection of transaction prices and facilitate the measurement of price change in an area where the products and services available are undergoing significant change. A full description of these revisions is in  ""Revision of the CPI hospital services component.""   Other enhancements .  Several technological enhancements are planned for the CPI revision as well. We will modernize the processing systems for both the Consumer Expenditure Survey and the housing sample of rental prices. Each of these complex computer processing systems has reached the end of its current life-cycle, and will be modernized to stay current with technology. This revision will also build on the Point-of-Purchase Survey and significantly improve it by utilizing computer-assisted telephone data collection. Utilization of a shorter interview and edits at the point of collection should lead to faster data turnaround and consequently more up-to-date information on the distribution of consumer spending across outlets. Based on the improved survey methodology, BLS can introduce new outlets and items into the CPI more rapidly and efficiently. Moreover, the new Point-of-Purchase Survey sample design will permit a shift to sample rotation by category rather than by geographic area, and thereby facilitate accelerated sample rotation in product areas where markets are most dynamic. The article, "" New methodology for selecting CPI outlet samples ,"" describes this new methodology and its implementation.   A final, crucial element in the current revision is the conversion to electronic systems of all commodities-and-services and housing data collection and transmission. A fully-implemented computer-assisted data collection (CADC) system for the CPI will significantly improve the overall quality of CPI data. While quality improvement is the primary justification for CADC, electronic data collection and transmission will probably provide long-term savings through a reduction of mail, paper and printing costs, and a transfer of some edit and review functions from the BLS national office to the local data collector.   CADC instruments will help to assure consistent application of survey rules and data review decisions at the point of collection. The results will be increased accuracy of collected data, greater conformance with collection procedures, a higher percentage of successfully completed collection schedules, and an increase in the yield of usable quotes per release of the index. Electronic data transmission also will allow collection of prices closer to the end of the month, improving coverage of price changes during the reference period.   The initial CADC system implementation, Version I, will be a fully reliable system that meets current data collection standards and will be a foundation upon which future enhancements can be built with confidence. This version will include all functionality necessary for housing. There will be basic edits and checks for collected data. In addition, a survey information and control system will be developed that will provide up-to-date information on the status and location of all housing data collection activities. Implementation of Version I will begin in 1997 and will be completed in 1998.   Strategically, we will build on our computer data collection experience with the housing data before undertaking the pricing and initiation of commodities and services in retail establishments. In Version II, there will be more functionality for initiation, and edits and checks will be expanded. The survey information and control system will likewise expand to control the larger volume of data collected for commodities and services. After Version II is operating smoothly, a part of the commodity analyst review will be incorporated into the CADC system at the point of collection. This will provide automatic checks for the comparability of item substitutions and transfer more functions from the national office staff to the regional staff.   THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MILESTONES in the overall revision schedule are presented in  exhibit 3 . The conclusion of the revision in 2000 does not mean the end of the CPI improvement process. BLS will continue to enhance its program of experimental indexes and research on CPI measurement issues. It is also reasonable to expect that the recommendations of the Senate Finance Committee’s Advisory Commission, as well as the results of other studies of the CPI by outside researchers, will lead to additions in the list of CPI improvements outside the revision context. Nevertheless, the decennial revision process remains the central method by which the BLS maintains the quality of the CPI and thereby ensures the index’s status as the most accurate and timely measure of changes in consumer prices.

Return from sale price         imputation           1984                     Introduced procedure to         eliminate downward bias for items discontinued by outlets         that went out of index with discounted prices.                       Rental equivalence           1985                     Changed CPI-W homeowners'         component to value of services.                       Enhanced seasonal products         methodology           1987                     Enhanced methodology used         for seasonal items by expanding the number of price         quotations to select products from alternate seasons and         eliminate under-representation of such items.                        Quality adjustment of used         car prices           1987                     Prices of used cars adjusted         for differences in quality after model changeovers.                       Aging bias correction           1988                     Rental values adjusted for         aging of the housing stock.                       Imputation procedures for         new cars and trucks           1989                     Price changes for         noncomparable new models are imputed using only the         constant-quality price changes for comparable model         changeovers.                       Quality adjustment of         apparel prices           1991                     Regression models used to         adjust apparel prices for changes in quality when new         clothing lines are introduced, and eliminate bias due to         linking product substitutions into the CPI.                       Discount air fares           1991                     Substitution rules modified         to expand pricing of discount airline fares.                       Sample augmentation           1992                     Increase in the number of         outlets from which prices are collected to replace sample         lost through sample attrition.                       New models imputation           1992                     Refined imputation methods         used when introducing products into the CPI.                       Hotels & motels           1992                     Samples for hotels and         motels quadrupled to reduce variances related to seasonal         pricing.                       Seasonal adjustment           1994                     Procedures for seasonal         adjustment revised to eliminate residual seasonality         effects.                        Quality adjustment for         gasoline           1994                     Treat         ""reformulated"" gasoline as a quality change and         adjust the price to reflect quality difference. Impact of         the change estimated.                       Generic drugs           1995                     Introduced new procedures         that allow generic drugs to be priced when a brand drug         loses its patent.                       Food at home base period         prices           1995                     Introduced seasoning         procedures to eliminate upward bias in setting of base         period prices of newly initiated items.                       Rental equivalence           1995                     Modified imputation of         homeowners' implicit rent to eliminate the upward drift         property of the current estimator.                       Composite estimator used in         housing           1995                     Replaced current composite         estimator with a 6-month chain estimator. Under-reporting         of 1-month rent changes had resulted in missing price         change in residential rent and homeowners' equivalent         rent. Old estimator also produced higher variances.                       Commodities and services         base period prices           1996                     Extended food-at-home         seasoning procedures to remainder of commodities and         services series. Base period prices left unchanged in         most noncomparable substitutions.                               Exhibit 2 .

Rolling-in the new areas into the CPI allowed more time to train field representatives. More importantly, using the existing procedures for introducing new outlet samples on a systematic basis precluded the need to maintain dual operations, one for the current CPI and one for the revised index.      15  Marcoot, ""Revision of Consumer Price Index.""      16  S.G.

The motors on the cotton candy machines can jam and overheat, posing a fire hazard. Additionally, the heating unit can be activated without the spinner in place, presenting a risk of burn to consumers. CPSC and Rose Art have received 225 reports of the machines overheating. There have been three reports of fire, one resulting in an estimated $2,000 in property damage. CPSC has received a report of two unconfirmed minor injuries. The recalled cotton candy machines have either a blue or a purple base and a clear plastic cover. The words ""The Real Cotton Candy Machine"" are printed in a rainbow of colors on the base of the machine and on the packaging. The product is marketed for children ages 10 and up. The cotton candy machines were made in China. Toy and discount stores sold these cotton candy machines nationwide from September 2001 through April 2002 for about $27. Consumers should stop using these cotton candy machines immediately and contact Rose Art at (888) 262-4474 anytime for a free replacement motor unit, and free samples of flavored sugar to make cotton candy.

The state's modern economy began with the discovery of gold in the late 1850s. The state was heavily dependent on natural resources through the onset of World War II, with mining and agriculture the leading industries. During the war and post-war period, the Federal government vastly increased Colorado-based, defense-related activities and established a complex of regional offices. Cutbacks in the state's defense industry in 1960s ended the Federal government's dominant role in the economy. The ensuing slowdown was followed by nearly 40 years of mostly robust population and job growth, which saw the development of today's technology and service-oriented economic base. This most recent period will be given the greatest attention in this report. Focusing on a single industry in a particular period is, of course, an oversimplification. For example, tourism, while never the state's dominant industry, has been an important compone nt of the state's economy since the late nineteenth century. Resource-based industries, despite their diminished status, have enjoyed brief periods of resurgence over the last half-century. Thus, while developments in the dominant industry will be stressed, other sectors will also be examined. Over the past 150 years, Colorado's economic development was largely determined by availability of natural resources, labor and other inputs into the production process along with access to markets and fluctuations in demand for products. Raw materials, particularly gold and silver, were the critical element in the mining economy. Water and land were necessary for agriculture as were railroads for transporting farm products. Long distances from major population centers and the lack of navigable waterways prevented the development of much heavy industry, although massive coal deposits led to steel production. Colorado's industries have generally been able to attract workers. The shift toward an advancedtechnology economy since World War II was possible because the state's desirable living conditions enabled Colorado firms to attract workers with the necessary skills. The movement of these workers into the state resulted in one of the most highly educated labor forces in the nation. It has also meant that migration and therefore population growth was usually closely tied to job generation. Chart 2 shows this relationship since 1950. (The charts are at the end of the text beginning on page 25.) Large numbers of people moved to Colorado during the periods of rapid job growth in the 1970s and 1990s while the sluggish job gains in the late 1980s resulted in net out- migration. The longer-term trends in the state economy can be traced to changes in basic industries. These basic industries served as economic drivers; they were export-based industries, which brought outside dollars into Colorado. However, other industries supplying either basic industries or households have also been critical. Few of Colorado's industries would have grown without a  1   A Brief Economic History of Colorado supporting transportation sector. The state's financial institutions helped channel much of the capital needed for economic growth. Demographic forces also shaped Colorado's economy. Immigrants from outside the U.S. in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century provided a workforce for the state's mines and farms. Members of the baby-boom generation moving into Colorado in the 1970s fueled the highest rate of residential construction in the state's history. Demographic changes were simultaneously a cause, an effect and a necessary condition for most of the major economic events. Among the most significant demographic changes is the change in age distribution of the population. This is shown in Chart 6, w hich traces the baby-boom generation through the last 40 years. Neglecting the economic diversity of Colorado's regions would present an incomplete picture. Colorado's macroeconomic data is heavily weighted toward the Front Range which, depending upon how it is defined, makes up as much as 90 percent of the state's current economic activity. But different economic patterns of economic performance appear in the resource and recreation dominated mountain and western regions as well as in the agricultural areas in the eastern plains and valleys. Population patterns have varied in the different regions. Chart 1 shows population in the state's three major regions since 1870. Since the early 20th century, and particularly since World War II, the bulk of the growth has occurred along the Front Range. Population in the eastern plains peaked in the 1920s and declined until the 1990s. In the western and mountain regions, overall population stabilized after the mining boom ended, but has grown rapidly over the past 40 years. Market fluctuations brought prosperity or failure for important segments of the Colorado economy. For example, the discovery of silver deposits led to the state's first great boom in the 1880s but slumping demand brought about a downtur n in the following decade. Massive flows of capital into the telecommunications industry more than a century later contributed to the prosperity of the 1990s. But it also led to the downturn in the early twenty- first century. Colorado's economic cycles have, for the most part, coincided with those of the nation. Chart 4 compares United States and Colorado job growth since 1950. The state has generally grown faster than the nation with the middle 1980s an exception. The overall prosperity of Colorado citizens has varied over the state's history. Chart 3 compares state and national per capita income. Per capita income is a crude measure of economic well- being of the average person and periods of rapid expansion usually saw relative gains for the state. Fluctuations in construction activity have been an important factor in causing cyclical changes in the state economy. Chart 5 highlights Colorado construction cycles over the past 40 years. Over the past century and a half, the state's industrial makeup shifted away from agriculture and mining toward a greater share of earnings in manufacturing and later in the service industries. Chart 7 traces changes in the distribution of earnings since 1940.  2   A Brief Economic History of Colorado  THE RESOURCE BASED ECONOMY: 1850s THROUGH 1940 Colorado in 1850 The first century of Colorado's modern economic history saw the development of important export-based industries as well trade, services and production serving regional markets. By the middle of the nineteenth century, industrial economi es were developing in Europe and the eastern U.S. But what was to become Colorado was, for the most part, a subsistence economy. It not only lacked industry, but had little agriculture. The population consisted of native peoples largely dependent on hunting, fishing and foraging. A few Europeans trapped and traded with the natives. Bents Fort on the Arkansas River was a trading center for travelers along the Santa Fe Trail. A small number of farming settlements were found in the San Luis Valley. The Mining and Agricultural Era: 1860-1920 The first gold rush to Colorado occurred in the late 1850s spurred by discoveries along Cherry Creek. The earliest market economy in Colorado consisted of mining and the various businesses supplying and supporting the mines and the miners. These included retailers, purchasers and processors of gold ore or dust, churches, local governments and, of course, the infamous brothels and saloons. The gold boom quickly receded as the early discoveries were exploited and few new ones were found. The Civil War and battles with the plains Indians took men away from the mines and made commerce with the rest of the nation difficult. The mining industry rebounded in the 1870s with several major silver discoveries. Leadville became the largest silver producing area in North America with Aspen, Georgetown and Telluride also major production centers. A significant smelting industry also developed. At the peak of the silver boom in the 1880s, the state reached a level of prosperity not to be seen again until the middle of the next century. Colorado's population more than doubled during the 1880s. But silver demand began to recede as the nation entered a period of deflation. The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 marked the end of the national bi-metallic standard and was a watershed event for the Colorado economy. The death of bi-metallism also marked the apex of the metal mining industry, although the Cripple Creek gold strike in 1890 brought a short revival. Replacement of bi- metallism with a gold standard contributed to further deflation, which was generally harmful to the state's business and farms. The last half of the nineteenth century saw the beginnings of Colorado's farming and ranching industries. The passage of the Homestead Act, which granted land ownership to settlers, opened much of eastern Colorado to small farms. The new farmers soon discovered the difficulty of dry-land farming in the region, but major irrigation projects facilitated crop production in the river valleys. Cattle drives from Texas were first undertaken to feed the miners. Soon cattle were raised and fattened on Eastern Colorado's prairies. Agricultural areas prospered during the early years of the 20th century. The population in the 17 counties in Colorado's eastern region tripled between 1900 and 1920. (Chart 1) 3   A Brief Economic History of Colorado Immigrant workers made an important contribution to Colorado industrial activity in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Irish and Italian immigrants provided much of the workforce for the larger scale metal mining and smelting operations and later for the coal mines. The farmers settling along the river valleys in Eastern Colorado included recent immigrants, many of them from Germany and Russia, as the railroads recruited potential farmers, and future customers, from Eastern Europe. While metal mining and agriculture dominated the Colorado economy through 1920, other industries also made important contributions. The state's massive coal reserves were exploited. The turn of the century saw the beginnings of a manufacturing industry. A sparse population meant that the manufacturing was tied to available inputs, mostly the products of mines, farms and ranches. Availability of coal led to a steel mill in Pueblo. Facilities were begun for the processing of agricultural products including sugar beets, alfalfa, livestock and grain. The development of railroads provided market access for both mining and agriculture. The railroads also stimulated Colorado's tourism industry. Tourists were first attracted to the state in the late 19th century and their numbers increased with the coming of the automobile. Colorado's climate also attracted persons with respiratory ailments and a number of treatment centers were developed. Depression: 1920-40 The First World War stimulated demand for Colorado's agricultural products as well as for coal and steel. But prosperity was fleeting. While the 1920s are remembered as a boom period for the nation, the natural-resource-based Colorado economy suffered from declining prices for farm products as well as for metals. The impact of the Great Depression of the 1930s was made worse by a prolonged drought. Dust bowl conditions in eastern Colorado drove many far mers from the land. The Eastern plains counties lost more than 10 percent of their population between 1930 and 1940 (Chart 1) and the number of farms in the state, which reached an all time high in the 20s, fell 14 percent. As was the case nationally, the depression ravaged the state's banking sector. The Colorado Banking Commission reported that assets of state -regulated banks fell 40 percent between 1929 and 1934. The Colorado Economy in 1940 Colorado population in 1940 was 1.1 million after the slowest decade of growth since the 1860s. (Chart 1) With lower family formation and fewer births the median age of the population rose to 29.2 years, up from 27.3 years in 1930. The industrial base of the Colorado economy in 1940 was still heavily weighted toward natural resources. According to the 1940 Census, 21 percent of the state work force was employed in agriculture, and farming accounted for nearly 10 percent of all earnings. (Chart 7) Another five percent was employed in mining. Manufacturing accounted for 10 percent of the workers, with most of them in food processing industries such as meatpacking, beet sugar refining and grain milling. The steel industry employed a large number 4   A Brief Economic History of Colorado of workers, as did producers of rubber products. Trade and distribution also provided livelihoods for many Coloradans and accounted for nearly 20 percent of earnings.  THE ERA OF FEDERAL SPENDING: 1940 -66 The Second World War brought not only an end to the depression but a significant expansion of federal government civilian and military activity in Colorado. Defense spending took its place alongside mining, agriculture and tourism as an important source of outside dollars. The war years also marked the beginning of a transition of Colorado from an economy based primarily on natural resources to one driven by technology and service industries. Population and job growth surged during the war and immediate post-war period. Between 1940 and 1950 the number of nonfarm jobs grew more than 50 percent. The state's civilian job growth was significantly faster than that of the nation over the decade. The demographic impetus in the years after the war was provided by the World War II generation starting families. People moved to Colorado in large numbers during the war and immediate post-war period, a trend that was to continue through the rest of the 20th century. In many cases, the new Coloradans had been stationed at the state's military bases during the war. Population growth during the 1940s was the fastest since the first decade of the century. Stimulated by government spending, the population and job base surged along the Colorado Springs to Fort Collins corridor. Front Range population nearly doubled between 1940 and 1960, increasing from fewer than 700,000 to more than 1.3 million over the twenty years. (Chart 1) Government Installations Mobilization for war led to formation or expansion of numerous military facilities in Colorado. These included Lowry Air Force Base, Buckley Field and the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in the Denver area. Among the bases in Colorado Springs were Camp Carson, later Fort Carson, Ent Air Force Base and Peterson Field. War-related government activity in other parts of the state included the Pueblo Ordinance Depot, Camp Hale near Leadville, where ski troops were trained, and the Camp Amache Japanese Relocation Center near Granada. The U.S. Department of Commerce reported that Colorado military earnings grew from $1.7 million in 1937 to $152 million by 1945 or from four -tenths of a percent of total earnings to over 13 percent. Defense spending continued after the war. Colorado defense installations added in the post-war period included the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD), the Consolidated Space Command Center (CSOC) and the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. Private defense contractors such as the Martin Company, Dow Chemical operating the Rocky Flats plant, Ball Aerospace in Boulder and Sunstrand in Westminster were also important players in the state economy.  5   A Brief Economic History of Colorado Denver's central location led to many regional headquarters for Federal agencies. It was claimed that Colorado was second only to Washington D.C. in number of Federal agencies, although this is difficult to verify. Non-defense Federal facilities included the National Bureau of Standards and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder along with the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Geological Survey in Lakewood. Construction and Real Estate Between 1950 and 1966 Colorado added 900,000 residents and almost 400,000 new jobs. This created a need for a sizable expansion in the stock of homes and commercial structures. Residential suburbs stretched outward along the Front Range. The Census of Housing showed that the state's housing stock increased by 240,000 or 68 percent between 1940 and 1960. (Chart 5) Shopping centers sprang up along with industrial and office parks. Downtown Denver changed radically in the 1950s after decades of somnolence. Outside capital from investors such as Webb & Knapp in New York and the Murchison family in Texas remade upper downtown Denver. New retail space and hotels were built downtown and two of the state's major banks built new headquarters. Public construction was also important. The Denver-Boulder turnp ike opened in 1952. The Frying Pan-Arkansas water diversion project began in the early 1960s. Colorado's colleges and universities expanded to accommodate the increased enrollment of war veterans. Between 1940 and 1960 enrollment at state supported higher education institutions increased from 10,000 to 26,000. Agriculture World demand for foodstuffs in the post war period brought rising farm prices and a period of great prosperity for Colorado's farmers. Agricultural output expanded and farm incomes rose. But in the 1950s falling prices and a dry period brought the agricultural boom to its end. Drought and excessive cultivation of dry land during the post-war years were responsible for a mini -dust bowl in eastern Colorado in the 1950s. The state's food processing industries grew with agricultural prosperity. Tourism and the Service Economy Rising incomes and the increase in young families generated demand for Colorado's tourist attractions. Winter tourism assumed a greater importance with development of major ski areas, many of them by former ski troopers who were stationed in the state during the war. This period saw Aspen develop as the state's first large -scale destination resort. Other service sectors such as health care also thrived.  6   A Brief Economic History of Colorado Mining With the beginnings of the Cold War and an increased emphasis on nuclear power, uranium production became an important industry in western Colorado. In 1956 the state had 150 active producers in the field and 5 mills. Oil and gas production also picked up in the 1950s. Coal mining surged during the war but declined thereafter due to competition from natural gas and other fuels. Regional Patterns of Development After experiencing slow growth since the middle 1920s, the state's population exploded, increasing from 1.1 million in 1940 to just over 2 million in 1966. (Chart 1) Total state population increased 56 percent between 1940 and 1960, but the number of children under 15 almost doubled. Virtually all of the growth in this period occurred along Colorado's Front Range. The fastest growth was in Denver's suburbs. The combined population in Adams, Arapahoe and Jefferson Counties increased by a factor of five over the 20-year period. The City and County of Denver, which could still easily annex adjacent land, grew from 323,000 in 1940 to near its present half- million population by the middle 1960s. Consolidation in agriculture meant the disappearance of many small farms and declines in the agricultural trading centers that supported them. The eastern plains counties lost some 15 percent of their population. The mountain region's overall population was stable. Strong growth in more urbanized counties such as Montrose, La Plata and especially Mesa counties was offset by population losses in the areas dependent on mining and agriculture. Slump in the 1960s Significant job cuts by defense contractor Martin Marietta and its suppliers marked the end of the Federal sector's leading role in the Colorado economy. With the completion of a major contract for the Titan II missile, Martin, by far the state's largest defense contractor, cut its work force from 14,000 to 6,000. This brought about a brief slowdown in the state economy, particularly in metropolitan Denver. Job growth slowed in the 1962-65 period and net migration fell into the negative range in 1965. (Charts 3 & 4) The Colorado Economy in 1966 Over the quarter century ending in the middle 1960s, manufacturing's share of the economic activity grew while that of agriculture declined. (Chart 7) More than one -third of state manufacturing earnings was still accounted for by such long-time standbys as food processing, steel, leather products and rubber products. Defense contracting assumed an increased importance with ordnance accounting for 13 percent of manufacturing earnings. Mining declined in importance while finance and services increased somewhat. Colorado became more  7   A Brief Economic History of Colorado prosperous. Per capita personal income exceeded the U.S. average through most of the two decades after the war. (Chart 3)  THE BOOM YEARS: 1966-84 Between the middle 1960s and the middle 1980s Colorado experienced unprecedented growth. Employers added almost 800,000 new jobs, more than doubling the size of the work force. This was a rate of growth almost twice that of the nation over the same period. Population grew by 1.2 million with almost three-quarters of a million of this increase due to net migration, i.e. persons moving into the state less those moving out. It was also a time of wealth accumulatio n that recalled the days of the silver barons a century earlier. A Denver business reporter described the scene. ""Denver was rich, unimaginably rich. People made fortunes, sometimes in a matter of days. A fever possessed the city.... Tales of riches echoed across the plains and people came flocking."" Government statistics back up this picture of wealth. State per capita person income, which had fallen four percent below the U.S. average by the late 1960s, rose to more than 8 percent higher than the U.S. by the early 1980s. (Chart 3) The driving forces behind this boom were first technology and later energy. The strength in these basic industries unleashed rapid expansion, and eventually excesses, in real estate and finance. Changes in the Economy The state's job mix shifted toward higher skills and greater technical sophistication. This period saw Colorado's manufacturing base move away from the traditional industries and toward advanced technology. By 1984, the share of manufacturing earnings accounted for by food processing, steel, leather, and rubber products dropped to 17 percent or roughly half its share in 1966. Other durable manufacturing, much of it advanced technology, registered a comparable increase. Food processing declined in impor tance. Most of the state's sugar beet mills closed in the 1970s and meat processing plants relocated to lower wage areas. Overall, the manufacturing share of private earnings fell while that for business services and oil and gas production and exploration increased. (Chart 7) Business Cycles Between the mid-1960s and the mid-1980s, the Colorado economy's strong growth path was interrupted by two major U.S. recessions. The first occurred in 1974-75 and was compounded by a sharp downturn in the state bui lding activity. The number of net new jobs in the state fell from 82,000 in 1972 to only 4,000 in 1975. Homebuilding dropped by 70 percent. (Charts 4 & 5)  8   A Brief Economic History of Colorado In 1981-82 the U.S. economy suffered its most severe downturn since the great depression of the 1930s, as the Federal Reserve invoked sharply restrictive monetary policy in an attempt to rein in double-digit inflation. Colorado job growth slowed from over 90,000 in 1978 to only 11,000 in 1983. Homebuilding fell by one -third, but quickly rebounded b y 1984. (Charts 4 & 5) In both these downturns, Colorado's economic path closely tracked that of the nation although the state's performance was somewhat stronger. Both recessions were followed by robust recoveries in both the state and the United States. Demographics The demographic driver during this period was the baby boom generation. These were the young people born between 1946 and 1964 who were beginning to reach adulthood in the mid 1960s. (Chart 6) The general prosperity of the period gave the older baby-boomers freedom to move, and many moved to Colorado. Net migration into the state reached its all-time peak in 1973 when 90,000 more people moved into Colorado than moved out. Regional Patterns of Development Both the Front Range and the mountain regions posted strong growth during this period. The mountain regions were stimulated by energy development and other inflation-induced mining activity as well as by skiing and other tourist activity. The eastern plains benefited from high farm prices, some oil and gas activity and a generally prosperous regional economy. Fifty-six of the states sixty-three counties added jobs between 1969 and 1984. Technology In the 1970s, firms such as Hewlett Packard, Storage Technology and Texas Instruments built or expanded along the Front Range. These firms were attracted to Colorado by the availability of skilled labor and access to their markets. The attractive life style in Colorado's cities meant that tech firms could attract workers from elsewhere if they were not available locally. Denver's role as a major air transportation hub facilitated the movement of workers and products in and out of the region. Construction and Real Estate As the baby boomers reached adulthood, they created a demand for housing and homebuilding increased rapidly through the late 1960s and early 1970s. Between 1960 and 1980 almost halfmillion new units were added to Colorado's housing stock. This was an increase of nearly 80 percent over the twenty years, even faste r than that in the previous two decades. The most explosive growth was in multi -family building. The building boom prior to the 1974 recession saw the construction of ""swinging singles"" apartment complexes in areas such as Southeast Denver's Leetsdale Drive. The number of housing units authorized by permits 9   A Brief Economic History of Colorado reached at all-time high of 64,000 in 1972. (Chart 5) Increases in the workforce generated demand for new offices and other work places. Over 40 million square feet of office space were built in downtown Denver during the 70s and early 80s, tripling the existing supply. Mining and Energy The oil boycott by the Arab nations in the early 1970s and the Iran- Iraq war in the latter years of the decade caused the price of oil to rocket from around $2 per barrel in the early 1970s to near $40 per barrel in the early 1980s. As a result, Colorado oil and gas employment boomed, with the number of jobs growing form 6,000 in 1972 to almost 30,000 in 1982. Most of these jobs did not involve oil producti on in Colorado, but supporting activities for drilling throughout the Rocky Mountain region. Denver's central role in oil and gas exploration can be explained by access to transportation. It was noted that the easiest way to get from Billings to Casper was to fly through Denver. The number of drilling rigs operating in the Rocky Mountains surged from 250 in the middle 1970s to 600 in the early 1980s. The industry was also responsible for many in additional jobs in areas such as legal services, business services and financial services. In the inflationary environment of the l970s, demand and prices for raw materials climbed rapidly. Among the hot commodity markets was that for molybdenum, which was used as a steel alloy. The largest North American deposits of molybdenum were found in Colorado near Climax and Empire. Production boomed in the late 1970s; metal mining employment in Colorado peaked at over 12,000. But with the end of inflation, competition from third-world producers, and increased production as a copper byproduct, demand slackened. Eventually, the large mines were closed and today the industry employs only a few hundred workers. Coal production also increased as the cost of oil rose and the demand from electric utilities for clean low -sulfur coal grew. Through the 1960s most coal production took place in underground mines in the Boulder and Trinidad areas. In the 1970s large new surface mines opened in the northwestern part of the state. In 1981 state coal production reached at all-time high with 70 percent of the output from surface mines. Oil shale development, proposed in the northwestern part of the state, was the most ambitious effort in Colorado's energy boom. The vast oil shale reserves in the Piceance basin in Western Colorado and Eastern Utah had long been viewed as having the potential for large -scale production with improved technology and a sufficiently high price. The first oil shale retort in Colorado was built in 1917 and Union oil operated a surface retort in the 1950s. However, oil discoveries elsewhere rendered production from shale uneconomical. As the price of oil approached $40 per barrel in the early 1980s shale development again seemed imminent. The Colorado Energy Research Institute in 1981 listed 16 oil shale projects in western Colorado and eastern Utah. Oil giant Exxon's Colony Oil Shale Project near Parachute 10   A Brief Economic History of Colorado envisioned eventual production of 200,000 barrels of oil per day. Exxon planners projected thousands of jobs and a Grand Junction population of one -quarter of a million people. But the high price of oil stimulated new production as well as conservation. The price of oil fell and it became apparent that production from shale was, once again, not economical. Exxon announced it was pulling out of the Colony Project in 1982. Tourism The 1960s and early 1970s were a ""golden age"" for Colorado skiing. In 1960 the industry had 27 lifts and one half million lift tickets were sold. The Aspen area dominated the state's destination-resort marke t while Winter Park, Arapahoe Basin and Loveland catered to Front Range skiers. Twenty years later, the 1981-82 season opened with 214 lifts operating and saw eight million skier-days. Major Colorado ski areas opened in the 1960s and early 1970s included Breckenridge, Steamboat, Vail, Snowmass, Copper Mountain, Keystone and Telluride.  REGIONAL RECESSION 1984-90 By 1984, the excesses of the long boom period had reached the point where a downturn was inevitable. The Colorado economy entered a two-year decline followed by several years of relatively slow growth. Job losses during the 1984-86 were the largest since jobs data were first compiled. The state grew more slowly than the nation for the first time since the middle 1960s and more people moved out of the state than moved in for five straight years. The collapse in the energy industry also marked the likely final fling for the natural resource sectors of the state economy. The 1980s also saw declines weakened demand as well as employment fell sharply and regions. Cutbacks were also in Colorado's traditional manufacturing ind ustries in the face of an increasingly cost-competitive environment. Iron and steel the leather and rubber industries shifted production to lower cost the order of the day in the food processing industry.  Overall Economic Performance The Colorado economy rebounded robustly from the 1981-82 U.S. recession, posting a very strong 5.7 percent job gain in 1984. (Chart 4) But by late 1984 the expansion had lost its momentum. Over the next two years the Colorado economy declined steadily. Between December 1984 and November 1986 some 30,000 jobs were lost. The state unemployment rate rose to 8.5 percent of the labor force. Construction activity was sharply curtailed. The number of new housing units dropped from more than 50,000 in 1983 to just over 10,000 by 1989. (Chart 5) Home prices fell throughout the latter half of the 1980s. With nonresidential building also reduced, the number of construction jobs declined by more than one -third. 11   A Brief Economic History of Colorado During this period, state per capita personal income dropped below the national average. (Chart 3) Faced with lower incomes, declining home values and actual or potential job losses, Colorado consumers trimmed their spending. State retail sales fell in 1985 and showed no gain in 1986. State and local governments were confronted with revenue shortfalls and were forced to cut their budgets. Although the decline in the Colorado economy ended in late 1986, significant recovery was delayed until 1990. The huge overhang of unsold homes and vacant office space limited any gains. End of the Oil and Gas Boom The Rocky Mountain region was and still is an expensive place to find and extract oil. Wells drilled here were generally deeper, more expensive and riskier than in other areas and therefore most vulnerable to declines in oil prices. When oil prices started to fall, drilling in the region plummeted. In early 1982 more than 600 rigs were active in the region, but by late the following year the number had fallen to just over 200. By the end of 1986 Colorado's oil and gas employment had been cut in half. The effects spread well beyond the oil industry. Office space was abandoned, demand for legal services, with the exception of bankrup tcy law, diminished. A sign hanging behind the bar at the downtown Denver Slant Hole, an establishment frequented by oilmen, summarized the situation. It read, ""Please God, just one more boom. I promise not to piss it away this time."" The Real Estate Bust The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 greatly expanded opportunities for tax-sheltered investment in commercial real estate and stimulated a flow of funds from passive investors such as doctors or entertainers into previously uneconomic projects. The repeal of these measures in 1986 discouraged those investors not already frightened off by the massive supply overhang. Almost overnight lenders and investors realized that there was more office space in Denver than could be filled in the near or even distant future. New projects were canceled, lenders pressured developers to pay off their loans and regulators forced financial institutions to write down their assets. These cutbacks further reduced economic activity, which in turn eliminated even more potential tenants. The hot money, which had been attracted to Denver, went elsewhere. Office vacancy rates rose rapidly, peaking at over 30 percent in Denver's central business district, nearly twice the national rate at that time. Average lease rates for ""Class A"" office space dropped from $25/square foot in 1981 to $14/square foot in 1987-89. With job losses and falling incomes, the housing boom also collapsed. Foreclosures on housing units rose. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) increased its ownership of housing units in the DenverBoulder CMSA from one hundred in 1983 to more than 6,500 by mid-1985.  12   A Brief Economic History of Colorado Agriculture Colorado agriculture enjoyed overall prosperity in the 1970s and early 1980s. Prices for farm products were high in this inflationary period. Colorado farm income peaked in the middle 1970s and land prices soared. Prosperity inspired many farmers to invest heavily in land, buildings, machinery and livestock. But by the early 1980s a worldwide recession and increased foreign competition forced prices down. By 1986, the average price Colorado farmers received for wheat had fallen more than a third since the beginning of the decade and that for corn was off almost 50 percent. At the same time farmers were faced with higher interest and energy costs. Land values and farm incomes slumped and Colorado's farmers and ranchers faced severe financial stress. Troubles in the Financial Sector The slumping economy took its toll on the region's financial institutions. The most spectacular collapse occurred in the savings and loan industry. In Colorado, as in the nation, thrift institutions, or savings and loans, provided much of the financing for the rapid increase in home ownership after World War II. These insti tutions received short-term deposits and made longterm loans, almost exclusively home mortgages. As inflation, and interest rates, picked up in the late 70s, depositors were attracted to other higher-paying instruments. Regulations were relaxed so the S &Ls could raise their deposit rates, though they still were only receiving low returns on their older mortgages. The Federal government responded to this dilemma by removing the remaining limits on rates S&Ls could pay depositors and by allowing thrifts to expand their loan portfolio into higher yielding assets such as commercial real estate. The government also raised the insured deposit limit to $100,000. This allowed S&Ls to offer high rates of return on insured deposits, which attracted funds that then needed to be loaned out at high interest rates, accompanied by higher risks. This scheme was doomed to failure, but for S&Ls and for developers, who often had close financial ties to the thrifts, it was almost a license to print money. It led to exc esses and fraudulent schemes, particularly in fast growing areas like Colorado, before the government stepped in with a multi -billion dollar bailout in the late 1980s. Colorado's poster child for S&L abuses was Silverado Savings and Loan, which received notoriety because then-vice-president Bush's son sat on its board of directors. Silverado was involved in the financing Denver's real estate boom of the 1980s as well as accounting irregularities, conflicts of interest and questionable political connections. Federal regulators shut down Silverado in 1988 at an estimated cost to the taxpayers of $1 billion. The troubles were not limited to savings and loans. Many Colorado banks had loan portfolios heavily weighted toward energy, agriculture and real esta te. With asset values in these areas plummeting, the banks were forced to write down the loans, putting severe pressures on the institutions' financial stability. Weakness in the banking sector forced the easing of Colorado's very restrictive anti -branch banking laws. Consequently, the late 1980s and early 1990s saw 13   A Brief Economic History of Colorado consolidation of Colorado's banks and acquisition of some the state's largest banking institutions by out-of-state corporations. Causes of the Recession The downturn in the middle 1980s was unique in that it occurred during a period of general national prosperity. Not since the ""silver bust"" of the 1890s had Colorado seen such a severe regional downturn not linked to similar national weakness. The regional slump is often described as an ""oil bust"" caused by the collapse in oil prices. But the reasons for the downturn are more complex. The energy industry surged in the 1970s and early 1980s and declined sharply thereafter. Oil and gas exploration was a major industry in Metropolitan Denver and production was significant in the northwestern part of the state. But much of the state economy, like that of the nation, was harmed by high oil prices. Colorado consumed more energy than it produced and some economic analyses suggested that the lower oil prices might have a net positive effect on the state economy or, at worst, only a small negative one. The collapse in the state's real estate markets was probably a greater contributor to the downturn than the fall in oil prices. With deregulatio n of financial institutions the nature of real estate cycles changed. Previous cycles, such as that in the 1970s, saw tightening of the money supply leading to cutting off funds flowing from lenders into real estate investments. In the 1980s, banks and S&Ls were permitted to raise interest rates and attract new deposits. The monetary spigot was not turned off; it just became more expensive for lenders to attract funds. The higher rates lenders paid for funds meant that they needed to search for assets w ith a higher return. Thus, tightening by the Federal Reserve in the early 1980s led to funds being funneled into the hottest markets. The resulting flow of capital into Denver led to development well in excess of any reasonable projection of demand. As is the case in all speculative booms, a collapse was inevitable. It was hastened by the drop in oil prices, as well as the repeal of the ERTA tax shelter provisions, but would have happened even if oil prices had remained at $40 per barrel. Similar booms and busts occurred in areas with little energy industry, notably Boston in the late 1980s and California in the early 1990s. Oil prices caused the bust to the extent that they caused the boom. Other export base industries also contributed to Colorado's weak economy. Molybdenum mines laid off thousands of workers. Agriculture suffered a severed collapse in the 1980s Regional Patterns of Development During the middle and late 1980s, growth slowed in all parts of Colorado. The mountain saw only a modest increase in population while the plains area posted a decline. Growth Front Range was the weakest since the 1930s. (Chart 1) The eastern plains regions lost between 1984 and 1990 and growth in both the Front Range and Mountain regions fell to than half the pace of the 1969-84 period. regions in the jobs less  14   A Brief Economic History of Colorado The Mountain region's economic decline began somewhat earlier than in the rest of the state. The mountain and western counties lost jobs over the five years following the resource-boom peak in 1982. Of the state's 63 counties, 51 saw slower jobs growth in 1984-90 than in the 196984 period. Demographics The most striking demographic feature of this period was the number of people moving out of the state. This reversal of the previous quarter century's trend was entirely due to the job losses. (Chart 2) State migration patterns since World War II have been largely driven by job growth. Most of the migrants into Colorado are working age adults and their families. They may choose to relocate in the state because of the climate or the style of living, but unless there are jobs available they will not come. While the number of jobs was declining in Colorado it was growing in other states, notably in California. As a result, the state experienced negative net migration from 1986 through 1990.  THE REBOUND IN THE 90s The slowdown in the 1980s brought down the cost of doing business in Colorado and sharply reduced the huge excess supplies of homes and office buildings. By 1990, the state again was poised for strong and sustained growth. The surging Colorado economy of the 1990s, like that two decades earlier was fueled by growth in the advanced technology sectors and by a sharp increases in construction activity. The dominant force in Colorado's 1990s boom was the very strong national economy. Many observers felt that the U.S. was entering a new economic age. These optimists believed that technological breakthroughs would lead to a permanent upward shift in productivity growth, which would mean rapid gains in jobs, output and profits. The promise of the ""new economy"" attracted record investment, particularly into technologically-advanced industries. Colorado with its industry mix, attractive living conditions and educated population drew more than its share of the ""new economy"" investment. As noted earlier, the relatively favorable cost environment during the early years of the decade also spurred state growth. The slowdown in the middle and late 1980s limited increases in labor costs and led to lower prices for housing and commercial real estate, providing a temporary cost advantage to firms operating in Colorado. Overall Economic Performance The state experienced robust and sustained growth throughout the 1990s. Over the ten years, state population increased by slightly more than 1 million making Colorado the third fastest growing state in the nation. Nearly 700,000 new jobs were added; the annual increase in state employment was almost 2 percent a year faster than that of the nation. (Chart 4)  15   A Brief Economic History of Colorado The average Coloradan benefited from the 1990s boom. The state ranked states in the rate of personal income growth during the decade. Per capita rising to eighth highest in the nation by 2000. (Chart 3) Average weekly sector rose 67 percent over the decade, well above the 43 percent increase CPIU. Technology and Telecommunications The telecommunications industry was an important force in the boom, particularly in the late 1990s. In Colorado, this industry included local and long-distance telephone services as well as wireless communications, the Internet, fiber optics and cable TV systems. The promise of high demand for broadband access to voice, video and data stimulated aggressive investment. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, which opened local and long distance phone systems to increased competition, attracted additional capital and new firms to the industry. This industry was an important part of Denver's economy with its share over overall economic activity in the metro area twice that of the nation. Denver had long been a center for the cable TV industry with several major firms headquartered there. Qwest and Level 3, two major players in fiber optic cable networks, were also located in the Denver area. Between 1990 and 2000, Colorado's employment in the communications industry doubled. Incomes also increased dramatically with average earnings in the industry doubling. However, the torrid pace of investment in the industry was unsustainable. Between 1998 and 20001 the number of miles of fiber increased by a factor of five and, at the same time, advances in technology increased the transmission capacity of each strand of fiber a hundred-fold. Demand, although increasing rapidly, could not keep pace. The promise of seemingly limitless growth attracted new entrants, and competition drove prices down. The companies had borrowed heavily to finance their ambitious expansion plans. Eventually, the telecom firms' financial positions deteriorated and some companies resorted to dubious financial maneuvers to conceal their conditions. Manufacturers of computers, components and peripherals as well as software firms also benefited from a strong stock market and soaring investment spending. Technology firms along Colorado's Front Range expanded their work forces spurring demand for office and mixed- use real estate. The region was among the national leaders in several tech areas. The Progressive Policy Institute's State New Economy Index, which ranked states based on their technology, knowledge and worker skills, rate Colorado number three in the nation in 1999. In 2000 Boulder County ranked first in software employment relative to population. Denver ranked ninth in these ratings and Colorado Springs 12th. Colorado ranked 12th in the nation in number of firms with biotech headquarters first among all the income grew rapidly, earnings in the private in the Metro Denver  16   A Brief Economic History of Colorado Construction and Real Estate Building activity surged, with net new construction jobs averaging more than 10,000 over the decade. Both residential and nonresidential construction activity expanded steadily. (Chart 5) More than 450,000 new housing units were built. A growing population and job base filled the new structures as they were comp leted. Several major publicly funded construction projects were also undertaken. The first and largest public project was Denver International Airport begun in 1989 and completed in 1995, almost two years behind schedule. Other major projects included three new structures for Denver's professional sports teams, several prisons outside the Front Range and numerous highway projects. Demographics Large numbers of people moved to Colorado throughout the decade with an average net migration of over 70,000 annually. (Chart 2) In the first half of the decade, many of the migrants came from California, which was then suffering from an economic downturn. Two features of the demographic changes in the 90s were the growth in the foreign-born population and the increase in the older population. The increase in the older population was caused by baby boomers nearing retirement either moving into Colorado or remaining in the state. By mid-1990s, the oldest of the baby boomers, many of whom moved to Colorado in the late 1960s and early 1970s, were entering their fifties. Some of the singles apartment complexes constructed for the young boomers in the 1970s were converted into living areas for ""mature"" couples. Boomers bought second homes in mountain resort communities with plans for eventual retirement. The mild climate in Mesa, Delta and Montrose Counties was particularly attractive to retirees. The share of population accounted for by the baby-boom generation was muted by the end of the century. Chart 6 shows Colorado's population by age since 1960. Note the bulges in population distribution corresponding to the baby-boom generation. But the bulges ""smooth out"" over the past forty years. In 1960, the bulge representing the baby-boomers, then aged 0- 14, stands out. By 1980, this generation, now 15-34, is less evident as migration evened out the age distribution of population. In 2000, the number of 25-54 year olds is only slightly higher than those in adjacent population age ranges. The other important change was the increase in foreign-born persons. Although U.S. immigration policies were liberalized in the 1960s, the most striking increase in migration from abroad occurred with the surging job growth in the 1990s. Colorado, with one of the tighte st labor markets in the nation, attracted more than its share. According to the 2000 Census, 370,000 of Colorado's citizens were born outside the U.S., and 201,000 of them entered the U.S. in the 1990s. The share of foreign born in 2000, 8.6 percent of the total population, was twice that in 1990. Although other parts of the world were represented, the bulk of the immigrants came from Latin America, principally Mexico. Over the decade of the 1990s, Colorado's 17   A Brief Economic History of Colorado Hispanic population increased 73 percent, rising from 13 to 17 percent of total population. Still, 75 percent of Colorado Latinos were born in the U.S. and over half were born in Colorado, the greatest share of native Coloradans of any ethnic group. Regional Patterns of Development Nearly all areas of the state enjoyed strong growth in the 1990s. Only 5 of Colorado's 63 counties lost population, the fewest in any decade since the 63 county boundaries were established. (Chart 1) Of Colorado's 63 counties, only three lost jobs during the 1990s and 53 showed faster growth than during the recession-plagued 1980s. Agriculture continued its century-long decline in the eastern plains counties. Falling prices and cutbacks in Federal farm programs reduced incomes late in the decade. However, the plains counties benefited from retirees taking advantage of the communities' safety and low living costs. Large commercial hog farming operations also stimulated some of the agriculture-based local economies. Finally, several penal institutions were built outside the Front Range to accommodate the states growing prison population. The mountain region economies benefited from retiree spending well as tourism. The decade saw the economic impacts of traditional tourists increasingly supplemented by second - home owners. The Colorado Economy in 2000 By the end of the century, Colorado had evolved into an economy driven by advanced technology and the service industries. As noted earlier, this shift was initially spurred by Federal government activities in the quarter century after the beginning of World War II. As the Federal role receded after the middle 1960s the changes continued and, in many areas accelerated. Chart 7, which shows the distribution of state earnings by industry in 1940, 1966 and 2000, demonstrates these changes. The traditional, resource industries continued to decline over the last 35 years. Farming's share of earnings, which had declined since the 1920s, continued to fall in the last third of the century, dropping from 4 percent in 1966 to 1 percent in 2000. Mining also dropped falling from 3 percent of all earnings in 1966 to 1.5 percent by 2000, although it surged to as high as 7 percent during the inflationary early 1980s. Within the mining sector, the decline was the greatest in coal and metals. Manufacturing's share of overall earnings also fell, dropping from 21.6 percent in 1966 to 11.9 percent in 2000. A major contributor to manufacturing's shrinking share of earnings was the trend toward increased use of temporary workers and the outsourcing of many functions formerly performed within the firm. As a result, many of the new jobs in business services replaced manufacturing jobs. The composition of the state's manufacturing sector changed. As incomes and costs rose, industries with a high proportion of relatively unskilled labor shifted to lower-cost areas. 18   A Brief Economic History of Colorado Colorado lost much of its traditional manufacturing, notably steel, leather goods, rubber and food processing. A bright spot in the food-processing sector was beer production, which thrived both in the state's two large breweries and in many microbreweries. The ""traditional industries"" accounted for more than one -third of all manufacturing earnings in 1966, but they fell to less than one -sixth by the end of the century. A corresponding increase occurred in printing and publishing, instruments and related products, and industrial and machinery and equipment (computers and components). The greatest earnings gain over this period occurred in the services sector, which grew from 22 percent to 35 percent of the total. Ten percentage points of this increase were accounted for by the business services sector. Business services is a diverse category, selling predominately to other businesses. It includes software firms, protective and janitorial services firms along with temporary worker firms, a category that grew rapidly in importance during the 1990s. Health services, second only to business services in 2000 earnings within the service sector, grew rapidly through the 70s and 80s, but slowed with the implementation of managed health care programs in the 1990s. Federal government, civilian and military, which made up more than 11 percent of all earnings in 1966, accounted for less than 5 percent by 2000. Other sectors with notable change included communications rising from 2.7 to 7.4 percent of earnings and finance, insurance and real estate (FIRE), which rose from 7.2 percent to 11.3 percent. All of the growth in FIRE occurred in areas other than depository ins titutions.  THE NEW MILLENIUM As was the case with earlier Colorado booms, the euphoria of the 1990s collapsed of its own exuberance. The year 2000 marked a peak in state economic activity. Signs of a bursting tech bubble appeared in the spring with the NASDAQ index reaching its all-time high in March 2000 and falling sharply through mid 2002. U.S. output growth began to slow and the nation fell into a mild recession in early 2001. Colorado's economy also began to decline by the spring of 2001. After growing considerably faster than the nation throughout the 90s, Colorado lagged the U.S. through 2001 and early 2002. Several factors contributed to the slow state growth. The sluggish national economy led to reduced tourism and to falling demand in the tech sector. The shakeout in the telecommunications industry disproportionably impacted the state economy. The travel and tourism industry took a further blow with the September 11 terrorist attacks. Colorado's booming real estate markets leveled off and, in some cases, declined. Office and apartment vacancy rates rose to heights not seen in over a decade. The rate of appreciation in home values slowed. A severe drought led to a sub -par ski season, extensive damage to many crops and the forced sale of as much as half of the state's cattle. Dry conditions in the mountains caused earlysummer wildfires, which further discouraged visitors.  19   A Brief Economic History of Colorado  When measured by the number of jobs lost through the middle of 2002, the latest downturn was the worst in state history. The percentage job decline was more than twice that at the national level. The state unemployment rate doubled. Homebuilding fell by 25 percent in early 2002. The volume of retail sales declined for the first time since the middle 1980s. The mid- year outlook for the Colorado economy is uncertain. The national economy appears to be struggling, with some economists calling for a ""double dip"" following the 2001 recession. The Colorado economy, after declining for a year and a half, may have hit bottom. But there are few signs of recovery. Weak spending by businesses and tourists has taken its toll and the telecommunications sector remains severely depressed. The defense industry is one of the few bright spots in the Colorado economy and single-family housing markets are holding up reasonably well. The longer-term outlook is more favorable. Technology and tourism are expected to rebound and Colorado should once again post faster growth than the nation.  20   A Brief Economic History of Colorado  Chart 1 COLORADO POPULATION BY REGION 5,000 4,500 4,000 3,500 Thousands 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 Mtns Frnt Rng Plains  Chart 2 COLORADO NEW JOBS AND NET MIGRATION 90 80 70 60 50 Thousands/Yr. 40 30 20 10 0 1955 -10 -20 5 years ending 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 MIG JOBS  21   A Brief Economic History of Colorado  Chart 3 COLORADO PER CAPITA PERSONAL INCOME PERCENT DIFFERENCE FROM US 12%  8%  4%  0%  -4%  -8%  -12% 1940 1945 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000  Chart 4 COLORADO & US JOB GROWTH 12% 10% 8% 6% 4% 2% 0% 1950 -2% -4% 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 CO US  22   A Brief Economic History of Colorado  Chart 5 CONSTRUCTION BOOMS & BUSTS 180 160 140 COLO CONST JOBS (000) 120 100 80 60 20 40 20 0 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 CONST JOBS HOUSING PMTS  70  60  40  30  10  0  Chart 6 COLORADO POPULATION BY AGE 12%  10%  1960 1980 2000  8% Pct. of Total  6%  4%  2%  0% 0-4 5-9 10-14 15-19 20-24 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 65-69 70-74 75+  23  COLO HOUSING PMTS(000)  50   A Brief Economic History of Colorado  Chart 7 COLORADO EARNINGS BY INDUSTRY 100% 90% 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% 1940 1966 2000  AG & MI CON,MFG & TPU TRD, FIRE & SV GOV  Notes Nearly all data cited in this report are from government sources.

GX241-80-11975080	Lawrence Labor Market Review       March 2000               Douglas County       Published Monthly                                                                            Employment and Unemployment.

Service-producing industries was up  300 from February 1999. Government and trade each  added 200 new workers. An increase of 300 in retail  trade was partially offset by a loss of 100 in wholesale  trade.  Services also added 100 from one year ago.

Nonfarm wage and salary  employment in the Lawrence area is expected to  increase throughout the spring with approximately 400  new workers anticipated during the next two months.

This is not meant to imply that data items categorized as ""marginal"" or ""specialized"" do not have very useful applications in other areas.   Appendix K is divided into four main parts related to their most appropriate application in the quick response freight modeling process:     Part 1 -- Baselines, forecasts, and growth factors   Part 2 -- Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and networks    Part 3 --  Survey development and other   Part 4 -- Specialized data sources, organized as air, pipeline, rail, water, and multimodal and others.

The data are derived from a universe of employees covered by Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). Data in the CBP represent the following types of employment covered by FICA:      all covered wage and salary employment of private nonfarm employers and of nonprofit organizations;     all employment of religious organizations covered under the elective provisions of FICA.  Data for employees of establishments totally exempt from FICA are excluded. These include the following types of employment: self-employed, government, domestic service, agricultural, foreign, and railroad employment jointly covered by Social Security and railroad retirement programs. For activities such as construction, transportation, electric and gas, establishments are represented by those relatively permanent main or branch offices, terminals, stations, etc. Hence, the individual sites or systems of such dispersed activities (e.g., worksites) are not ordinarily considered to be establishments. Note: Data for industries with less than 100 employees in a given county are not shown in the printed reports, but are included on the CD-ROM and computer tape.

The CFS is a continuation of statistics collected in the Commodity Transportation Survey from 1963 through 1977, and includes major improvements in methodology, sample size and scope.  A sample of 200,000 domestic establishments randomly selected from a universe of about 900,000 establishments engaged in mining, manufacturing, wholesale, auxiliary establishments (warehouses) of multi-establishment companies, and some selected activities in retail and service was used.  Each selected establishment will report a sample of approximately 30 outboard shipments for a two week period in each of the four calendar quarters of 1993.  This will produce a total sample of about 20 million shipments.  For each sampled shipment, zip code of origin and destination, 5-digit Standard Transportation Commodity Classification (STCC) code, weight, value, and modes of transport, will be provided.  Check box information on whether the shipment was containerized, a hazardous material, or an export will also be obtained.

Earlier surveys reported only the principal mode. The 1993 survey will report all modes used for the shipment (for-hire truck, private truck, rail, inland water, deep sea water, pipeline, air, parcel delivery or U.S. Postal Service, other mode, unknown). Route distance for each mode for each shipment will be imputed from a Mode-Distance Table developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Distance, in turn, will be, used to compute ton-mileage by mode of transport.

Data based on household interviews are obtained from the Current Population Survey (CPS), a sample survey of the population 16 years of age and over. The Bureau of Census conducts the survey each month for the BLS and provides comprehensive data on the employed and unemployed, including such characteristics as occupation, hours and industry. Data based on establishment records are compiled each month from  questionnaires sent by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in cooperation with state employment agencies. The Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey provides industry information on non-farm wage and salary employment, hours, and average weekly earnings. State agencies mail the questionnaires, then collect and  compile data and make employment estimates at the state level. National employment estimates are then made by the BLS.

GX265-25-16060864	"A ON IZ AR  M NO O EC  IC  DS EN TR  A PUBLICATION OF  THE ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC SECURITY  Winter 1999-2000    U.S. Union Membership Rises 265,000 Gain in '99 Largest in 20 Years; Arizona's Ranks Grow by More than 11% Helped by the spread of unions to occupations not normally prone to organize, the union ranks grew by more than a quarter-million in 1999 to 16.5 million, the largest membership increase in 20 years.1 In addition, despite strong growth in U.S. wage and salary jobs (2.7 million), the share who were union members remained unchanged at 13.9 percent. And for the first time since 1970s, the private-sector unionization rate did not fall, holding steady at about 9.4%. Data on unionization, which are produced by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, are obtained from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS), which provides basic information on the labor force, employment, and unemployment. The CPS sample is limited to wage and salary workers. Union membership increased by 112,493 in the private sector in '99, nearly double the size of the only other annual increase in two decades. The growth was due to a ""novel approach to spread the union gospel through a variety of occupations, not just jobs that require hard hats,"" said an Associated Press article, pointing out that in the last year, 45,000 doctors and 75,000 home health-aide workers unionized in California.2 A similar, but smaller trend occurred in Arizona, as physicians at a HMO in Tucson and Phoenix joined a union after they grew tired of restrictions on their ability to prescribe health-care treatments and drugs. Overall in Arizona, the union ranks rose by 14,000, or 11.4 percent, in '99, driving up the state unionization rate from 6.5 percent to 6.8 percent. And the amount of growth was the 14th largest among all states (see Table 1). The increase in Arizona, from 123,000 in 1998 to 137,000, was due to union outreach programs, growth in the number of part-time and temporary jobs, and a willingness of employees to speak out, according to an article in The Arizona Republic.3 In addition, a ""large gap between Arizona's wealthiest and poorest families, which was recently reported to be the second largest in the United States,"" was a contributing factor, said Lane Windham, a spokesperson with the AFL-CIO.4 The significant growth of union members nationally and an easing of the hemorrhaging of the unionization  rate, however, do not necessarily translate into a turnaround in the union movement, said several economists. And making it an uphill battle will be the continued trend of losing manufacturing jobs (to lower-wage countries) and gaining low-wage service jobs. Manufacturing has traditionally been a stronghold of labor, while low-wage workers are the least likely to join a union. "" `These numbers don't show a resurgence, they show a stability, which in a sense is a victory,"" Henry Farber, a labor economist at Princeton University, was quoted in a Los Angeles Times story.5 "" `But to me, it's really looking for the silver lining to say, `Hey, look at this. We didn't do any worse this year than last year.' ""6 The AFL-CIO agrees it will be a struggle, admitting that it will need to add between 500,000 and 1 million workers a year.7 About 600,000 workers joined unions last year, an increase of 25 percent over 1998, but due to attrition the net gain was only 265,000.8  I  N THIS ISSUE Volume 23 No. 4 Page  U.S. Union Membership Shows Strong Growth ....................... 4th Qtr.

Unionization by Industry and Occupation In 1999, government workers continued to have a substantially higher Figure 1 Percentage of Unionization in Major Occupational Groups, 1999  ""To keep up, the labor movement has been training and hiring more organizTable 1 States with Union Membership Gains in 1999  (in Thousands)  unionization rate (37.3 percent) than workers in the private sector (9.4 percent). Among the private nonagricultural industries, the highest unionization rate occurred in transportation and public utilities (25.5 percent). Unionization rates in manufacturing (15.6 percent) and in construction (19.1 percent) were higher than the average as well. However, the unionization rate in manufacturing continued to decline in 1999. Among occupational groups, protective service continued to have the highest unionization rate, at 38.2 percent (see Figure 1). Other occupational groups with higher-thanaverage unionization rates were professional specialty workers (19.7 percent); precision production, craft, and repair workers (22.4 percent); and operators, fabricators, and laborers (20.7 percent), many of whom work in the manufacturing industry.

The gap in unionization rates between the sexes has been closing; in 1983 the rate for men was 24.7 percent and the rate for women was 14.6 percent. Blacks continued to have higher unionization rates (17.2 percent) than whites (13.5 percent) and Hispanics (11.9 percent). Among the major worker groups, black men continued to have the highest union membership rate (20.5 percent), while white and Hispanic women continued to have the lowest rates (10.9 and 10.4 percent, respectively). Workers ages 35 to 64 were more likely to be union members than their younger counterparts. Full-time workers were more than twice as likely as part-time workers to be union members. Earnings In 1999, union members had median usual weekly earnings of $672, compared with a median of $516 for wage and salary workers who were not represented by unions. In addition to coverage by a collective barWinter 1999-2000  gaining agreement, the difference in pay reflects a variety of influences, including variations in the distributions of union members and non-union employees by occupation, industry, firm size, or geographic region.11 Notes: 1.

As a result, RA advises caution and recommends the inclusion of these revisions to all historical series used with any future analysis, interpretations, or references. Arizona's civilian labor force showed a gain of 5,200 workers (0.2 percent) during the final quarter of 1999, just slightly below the 10-year average gain of 6,100 workers (0.3 percent).

The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate declined by three-tenths of a percentage point to end the fourth quarter at 4.2 percent, continuing the record low quarterly averages of the last two years. Nonfarm payroll jobs increased by 3.6 percent (77,900) during the fourth quarter, just under the 10-year average of 3.8 percent. Employment gains over the entire year, however, were slightly above average. Ninety-five percent of 1999 nonfarm employment growth came from the service-producing industries, which added 77,300 jobs (4.4 percent) in the final quarter alone. Goods-producing industries added 600 jobs in the fourth quarter, a below-average gain for the season. Over-the-year employment growth in goods-producing industries was relatively slow in 1999, following a year of above-average gains in 1998. In service-producing industries, employment gains were driven by retail trade and the services (continued on page 11)  Year-to-Year Change and 10-Year Average Year-to-Year Change in Arizona Major Industry Employment, 4th Qtr. 19991  Nonfarm Employment Change (in Thousands) 60 50 40 30 20 0.1  10 0  -0.3  Total  Mfg.

The project will not only create 1,000 highly-paid jobs over the next five to eight years, but give a boost to an already construction market. The $2 billion fabrication facility will produce Intel's fastest chips from 12-inch silicon wafers, which will generate more than twice as many chips than currently possible using eight-inch wafers. Construction was to begin and February and be completed within one year. Semiconductor manufacturer Microchip broke ground last November on a long-delayed $1 billion expansion of its Chandler headquarters and manufacturing operations. The first phase of a three-part project -- a 200,000-square-foot office building that will house up to 1,000 employees -- is expected to be finished in about six months. Then, starting in the middle of 2001, work will begin on the first of two silicon-wafer plants, which are expected to eventually lead to an additional 1,000 jobs. The expansion, originally announced in 1996, had been delayed due to a slump in the Asian economy. Microchip, which makes microcontrollers for a variety of appliances, currently employs about 1,000 people in the Valley. Portland, Ore.-based Willamette Industries Inc., a paper and box manufacturer, is building a 250,000square-foot plant and warehouse in the west Valley town of Tolleson. When complete, the Fortune 500 company expects to hire 100 wage and salary workers for the corrugated-paper facility at 660 S. 83rd Ave. No timetable for the plant's opening was announced by Willamette, which has operated in Arizona since 1994. Philips Semiconductors announced it would establish a world headquarters for its standard analog business at the Tempe home of VLSI Technology Inc. The number of high-tech workers at VLSI's ASU Research Park facility (Elliot and Price roads) is expected to grow by 75 percent by 2003, with most of the 150 new hires involved with engineering, marketing, and technology development. Both companies are divisions of Netherlands-based Royal Philips Electronics. Philips Semiconductors makes computer chips for the consumer electronics, communications, auto, and PC industries, while VLSI designs and manufactures integrated circuits. Honeywell plans to cut 390 salaried positions in 2000 from its Aerospace Electronic Systems unit at sites in Glendale and north Phoenix. All those affected -- including managers, engineers, and production workers -- will be offered severance packages with a few receiving positions with Honeywell suppliers. An overlap of operations at Honeywell and AlliedSignal prior to their merger in December was given as the primary reason for 8 the cuts. The newly merged Honeywell International will employ about 16,500 workers in the Phoenix metro area. Construction Phoenix-based Westcor Partners is preparing to start work on two major upscale shopping projects in the east Valley totaling more than 600,000 square feet. Construction on a proposed 480,000-square-foot mall at the Price Freeway and Chandler Boulevard in Chandler could begin as early as March and open in October 2001. Currently named Chandler Fashion Center, it would house 150 businesses, three department stores (including the metro area's second Nordstrom), and a movie complex. About 15 miles to the north, Westcor is currently lining up tenants for a 140,000-square-foot shopping center at Scottsdale and Doubletree Ranch roads in Scottsdale. The development, called Shops at Gainey Village, will feature a mix of high-end retail specialty stores and restaurants. By a 3-to-2 margin, Scottsdale voters said ""yes"" to a $535 million redevelopment of the Los Arcos Mall (Scottsdale and McDowell roads), which will include an 18,000-seat arena for the Phoenix Coyotes professional hockey team. Work on the 72-acre Ellman Cos.' project, which will also include restaurants, retail shops, and a multiplex theater, will not get under way until at least spring of 2000. Plans for the project first must be approved by Scottsdale's redevelopment board and the Scottsdale City Council. Work will begin early next year on a 110-acre, $100 million retail development in the Desert Ridge master-planned community in north Phoenix. Called Desert Ridge Marketplace, the 1 million-square-foot center on the northeast corner of Loop 101 and Tatum Boulevard will include a number of specialty stores, a Barnes & Noble bookstore, and a 20-screen AMC theater complex. Contractor McCarthy Brothers of Phoenix expects to complete the project by mid-2001. Work has started or is about to begin on several master-planned communities in southeast Maricopa and northwest Pinal counties. Three home builders are collaborating with developer Sunbelt Holdings on the 1,100-home Power Ranch subdivision in Gilbert. Sunbelt is also involved with a 6,600-home community southeast of Queen Creek in Pinal County. The as-yet unnamed development was put together by the purchase of the Johnson Ranch golf course and some vacant lots for $22 million. Finally, Shea Homes is the lead builder on a 2,500-home community called Seville. Bounded by Higley, Chandler Heights, Riggs, and Power roads, the 1,400-acre development in southeast Maricopa County is expected to be annexed by the city of Chandler. Settlement of a dispute between development partners is expected to get the idle 600,000-square-foot Scottsdale Arizona Economic Trends   Waterfront project out of dock and moving again. Starwood Western Capital bought out Mashburn-Hope Ltd., thus ending a legal dispute between the co-developers. Now, construction on the $140 million retail, entertainment, office, and residential project on the southwest corner of Camelback and Scottsdale roads, along the Arizona Canal, is expected to get under way sometime in the second quarter of 2000. The Scottsdale Waterfront project was originally scheduled to open in October 2000. Transportation, Communications, and Public Utilities Mayan Networks, which recently opened an office in north Phoenix (I-17 and Bell Road), expects to hire 100 telecommunications engineers and programmers in 2000. The Silicon Valley-based company makes a product to retrofit existing telephone voice networks to handle the transfer of data from fiber-optic networks. Mayan claims its product, due out in the first quarter of 2000, is more efficient than existing ones on the market. Plans for yet another gas-fired power plant have been announced by two out-of-state utilities. Power Development Enterprises of Dallas and Industrial Power Technology of Santa Rosa, Calif., will build a $400 million facility near Gila Bend (about 70 miles southwest of Phoenix) that will create 200 jobs during the construction phase and 30 permanent jobs when complete. Work on the plant -- the fifth such facility proposed for the Phoenix MA -- will begin by late 2001 and be completed by early 2004, a spokesperson for Power Development said. Deregulation of the state's utility industry has spurred plans for seven new power plants in Arizona. The isolated Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, in the middle of the Sonaran Desert about 50 miles west of downtown Phoenix, is about to get two neighbors. Duke Energy Corp. and Pinnacle West Capital Corp. announced plans for two new natural gas-fired power plants that will provide energy to about 700,000 households. Pinnacle West, which owns Arizona Public Service Corp. (APS), said it will build a 2,120-megawatt plant one mile south of Palo Verde beginning in late 2000, creating about 350 jobs during the construction phase and 150 permanent jobs when the plant is fully operational in 2007. The first of four 530-megawatt generating units will open in 2003. Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy said it will build a similar-type plant, but about one-fourth the size, adjacent to Pinnacle West's plant. Construction on the 550-megawatt facility is slated to begin in the first quarter of 2001 and be completed in late 2003. About 300 to 350 construction jobs will be created during the building phase with 20 to 25 permanent jobs once the facilities are operational. The Valley got its third Spanish-language television station in late November. But what distinguishes KFE-TV, Channel 67, from the two others, said one of the station's investors, is that it will devote more time to local Winter 1999-2000  programming and target the Mexican-American community, as opposed to Hispanics overall. The two other Spanish-language stations, based in Miami and Los Angeles, offer mainly national programming. However, Univision Channel 33, the Valley's No. 1 rated Spanish-language channel, is building a multimillion-dollar broadcast center in south Phoenix, while Telemundo Channel 64 is shaking up its organization, revamping its logo and hiring a new general manager. The Phoenix metro area is the fastest growing Hispanic market in the nation, according to a local polling company. Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate San Antonio-based insurer USAA successfully bid on 500 acres of state land near Interstate 17 and Happy Valley Road for a regional office/customer-service operation. Within 10 years, the USAA campus could be home to up to 15,000 employees. One of the nation's largest insurers, USAA has been seeking a place to expand its multi-billiondollar business that sells all forms of insurance to current and former members of the military and their families. USAA will first build a temporary facility to house 500 to 600 employees by the end of 2001. Then, work on the first permanent buildings will begin, with an estimated opening of late 2002. Del Webb Corp. has moved its headquarters for its Sun Cities communities from Sun City West to the city of Surprise. The move into a new 35,000-square-foot building in its Sun City Grand community will lead to an additional 200 employees, bringing employment at its headquarters to 600. The relocation was brought about because the 17-year-old Sun City West has been completed, while Sun City Grand is less than one-third complete with 3,000 homes. Various operations within Prudential Corp.'s Real Estate and Relocation Services division will be consolidated at the 42-acre Kierland development in north Scottsdale by the middle of 2001. Prudential hasn't indicated how many of the division's 1,600 employees would be transferred from the six cities where the operations are currently housed. The division's headquarters, however, will remain in Irvine, Calif. The Prudential division helps companies and their employees with relocations. Metris Cos., which markets credit cards to households with incomes of $15,000 to $35,000, has purchased the 17-acre Perimeter Center in north Scottsdale (Bell and Pima roads) for a regional headquarters. Based in St. Louis Park, Minn., Metris will hire 700 workers for two subsidiaries  Direct Merchants Bank and Metris Recoveries -- in areas such as computer operations, credit risk, collections, customer services. Metris was expected to start operations in March. Trade Obviously much smaller in size than USAA (see above), but another San Antonio-based business hopes to make its 9   mark in the Valley. Mexican food chain Taco Cabana said it will build six Phoenix-area locations in 2000 (with the first opening in March) and three more in 2001. The 24-hour sit-down/take-out restaurant tries to fill the niche between a fast-food and full-service restaurant. Services Charles Schwab is looking at a site in south Chandler (Germann and Price roads) to open a 290,000-square-foot facility to process on-line stock trades. Between 50 and 75 people would be needed by the San Francisco-based brokerage for a 24-hour processing center. Schwab currently has 2,100 employees at four Valley customerservice centers, according to the Arizona Department of Commerce. To provide space for its fast-growing workforce, a Valley-based company that provides software training over the Internet is moving into 40,000 square feet of The Pinnacle In Kierland office complex in northeast Phoenix. KnowledgeNet, which trains workers at companies such as Boeing, AT&T, and Texaco, has grown from 15 to 130 employees since last March and expects to double that number by January 2001. Among positions needed to be filled are salespersons, technical trainers, graphic designers, software engineers, and courseware developers. Pinnacle In Kierland is located on the southwest corner of Scottsdale Road and Greenway Parkway. Integrated Information Systems (IIS) plans to move its corporate headquarters to The Brickyard on Mill development (7th Street and Mill Avenue) in downtown Tempe as part of a major growth initiative. The 11-year-old company, which provides Internet development and consulting services, expects to add a minimum of 300 employees, and possibly as many as 650, in 2000. Software developers and business consultants will encompass most of the company's new hires. IIS, which has been recognized as one of the nation's fastest-growing companies by Inc. magazine, currently has 350 employees at its headquarters at Priest Drive and Broadway Road. Scottsdale-based SCINET, which provides computer hardware and software solutions to the medical field, will double its office space when it moves to the Raintree Office Center (Loop 101 and Raintree Drive) in north Scottsdale next summer. Growing about 40 percent a year, SCINET will have room at its new corporate headquarters to expand its current Scottsdale workforce of 90 to 175. Sales, technical, and marketing positions are among the fastest growing jobs at the company. McCord Consumer Direct, a Chicago-based travel-management business, is opening a call center in Glendale in January. The 25,000-square-foot operation at 43rd and Olive avenues will employ 300 when it's fully operational. McCord's one other customer-service operation in Newport News, Va., takes 25,000 calls per day, generating about $7 million a month in revenue. 10  Although primarily a direct seller of computer hardware and software, Tempe-based Insight Enterprises Inc. has been expanding into other areas, such as outsourcing services. Of late, Insight has been hiring about 150 sales workers per quarter to handle customer-service questions for various manufacturers it represents. In addition, Insight has started an Internet service provider (ISP) business in England called PlusNet. Tucson-based Brake Masters said it will open seven new stores, in addition to its current 11 locations, in the Phoenix metro area in 2000. The company, owned by two brothers, has 50 locations throughout Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico. Brake Masters offers maintenance services (e.g., oil change, belts, hoses) in addition to its standard brake-repair business. Despite being up for sale by parent company Rite Aid Corp., Scottsdale-based PCS Health Systems, Inc. is hiring up to 250 workers for a call center and other positions. The pharmaceutical-benefit management company, which has 1,500 employees in Scottsdale, needs additional workers to handle more than 50 million U.S. and Puerto Rican customers and 300 million prescriptions a year. Desert Samaritan Medical Center in Mesa will consider opening a trauma center when it completes a $66 million expansion project in late 2000 or early 2001. The expansion is adding 72 beds (49 in the emergency department) and six surgical suites. The Phoenix metro area has five trauma centers, considered adequate for a metro-area population of 3 million, but none are in the southeast Valley. The closest facility is Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn near Scottsdale and Osborn roads, while three are near downtown Phoenix, about 20 miles away from Mesa. Government A nearly 150,000 increase in Mesa's population over the next decade will require the city to expand its workforce by nearly 50 percent, according to a consultant's study. The firms of SHW Group of Mesa and Pinnacle One of Tempe projected the city's population will grow from 395,000 to 540,000 by 2010, necessitating the city's workforce grow from its current 3,300 to slightly under 5,000. The police and fire departments will require about one-fourth of the projected new positions, just under 400. Tucson Metro Area Manufacturing Between 300,000 and 450,000 square feet of space will be added to The University of Arizona Science and Technology Park at Interstate 10 and Rita Road. Currently, 20 high-tech companies and about 6,000 employees occupy the 2 million-square-foot industrial park. The additional space could be filled immediately if it was currently available, said an official of the tech complex. On a somewhat related note, Tucson Mayor Bob Walkup Arizona Economic Trends   pledged to bring 10,000 aerospace jobs (paying between $16 and $18 an hour) to Tucson within the next four years. To dramatically cut costs, Weiser Lock will shift its production operation from Tucson to Nogales, Mexico, by the end of 2000. About two-thirds of the company's 725 workers will lose their jobs, while the other third -- administrative, sales, and distribution personnel -- will remain in Tucson. Construction Tucson voters in November approved a 62-acre downtown revitalization project called Rio Nuevo. The $320 million arts and entertainment development will use a mix of state sales taxes and private funding to build over 10 years an International Visitors & Trade Center, the Sonoran Sea Aquarium, a new hotel, and an IMAX theater. In addition, Rio Nuevo will re-create the Mission San Agustn Cultural Center & Settlement Area, as well as provide opportunities for mixed-use space, a community plaza, and a museum complex. Services The Marana Planning and Zoning Commission has approved a $105 million water-park resort about 20 miles north of Tucson. Developer Ike Issacson claims the project -- 1 acre of pools, plus a 400-room hotel, and more than 200 time-share units and condominiums -- will generate $365 million in annual revenue within 10 years. The indoor-outdoor water park has a tentative opening date of May 2001. A division of National Computer Systems (NCS) expects to hire up to 500 university graduates for a test-scoring facility it plans to open in February in the Miracle Mile area. NCS will pay a starting wage of $10 an hour for scoring written tests given to elementary and secondary students in subjects including math, reading, science, social studies, and geography. Balance of State Manufacturing A Minnesota cabinetmaker announced it will open a West Coast manufacturing and distribution facility  employing 300 near the town of Yucca. Norcraft Companies of Eagan, Minn., will occupy the former 185,000-square-foot Scott Paper plant near Interstate 40 and Arizona 95, about halfway between Kingman and Lake Havasu City. The addition of a natural gas pipeline and a rail siding connecting to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad mainline persuaded Norcraft to purchase the plant and will make it easier to attract other companies to the more than 230-acre industrial site. Construction A manufacturer of materials used to make explosives and fertilizer plans a $200 million expansion and upgrade of its facilities south of Benson. Apache Nitrogen Products Inc., which has about 100 employees, expects to hire hundreds of construction workers during the expansion project and 20 permanent workers when the facility is complete. No timetable was given for start of the project, which first must receive state and federal approval. In 1994, the company agreed to pay a $150,000 fine for hazardous waste violations and to upgrade its water-treatment system. An environmental official said Apache Nitrogen has been steadily cleaning up its site. Not to be outdone by its neighbor to the west, Prescott Valley and developers are working on plans for a 500-acre ""downtown"" business and entertainment center that will resemble an Old West Main Street. The primary core of the development will be a 200,000- to 300,000-square-foot entertainment complex that will include restaurants, retail stores and a 14-screen Harkins Theater. Fain Signature Group of Dewey, Ariz., and San Diego-based New Century Entertainment will co-develop the project, which will take 15 to 20 years to complete. Meanwhile, Sears, Roebuck and Co. reaffirmed its plans to be one of three anchor tenants (along with Dillards and J.C. Penney) in the Prescott Gateway Mall at Highway 69 and Lee Boulevard. Scheduled to open in March 2002, the Westcor Development project was put in limbo when Sears decided to delay the start on a 100,000-square-foot store because of recent poor financial results.

The increase in employment in the goods-producing industries reWinter 1999-2000  flects growth in manufacturing, which added 600 jobs (0.3 percent). This growth is approximately equal to the 10-year average for fourth quarter gains. Year-to-year growth over the course of 1999 was generally slower than the 10-year average and has been generally slower since the second quarter of 1998. Nevertheless, this industry does show signs of re-  covery from the Asian crisis last winter, particularly aircraft and missiles, which added 900 jobs, driving job growth in the final quarter.

As expected, finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) added 2,300 jobs over the quarter (1.6 percent). Employment growth in FIRE peaked in 1997 and has been slowing since, but remains steady as Arizona's residential population and business community continue to grow.  Quarterly services employment growth was normal for the season, with an average of 17,000, or 2.5 percent. Service employment growth showed definite gains over 1999, coming off of a general slowing since 1995. Business services continues to be the fastest-growing component of the services sector, accounting for nearly 60 percent of the new jobs created in services in 1999.  Government added 36,500 jobs, representing 11.2 percent growth, normal for the fourth quarter. Employment in this area tends to decline slightly over the first three quarters of each year with all employment gains appearing in the final quarter. Overthe-year growth in government was 1.2 percent, slower than the 10-year average of 3.4 percent. AET  the-year job growth showed a gain of 8,200, well-above the 10-year average of 7,200 jobs.  As expected, mining experienced an average reduction of 200 jobs. This loss occurred entirely within copper mining, continuing a downward trend for this industry.  Employment in transportation, communications, and public utilities (TCPU) increased by an impressive 2,300 during the fourth quarter of 1999. This concludes two years of generally strong job growth. Communications gains were high at 700 jobs over the quarter (1.9 percent). Transportation employment grew by an expected 1,600 jobs (2.4 percent), as the industry sought to meet holiday-travel demands.  Also in the holiday spirit, retail trade also showed employment growth of 4.8 percent over the final quarter of 1999, accounting for nearly all of the 19,100 jobs added to trade employment. Wholesale trade added a mere 200 jobs, below the 10-year average of 1,700 jobs. Over the year, growth in retail employment was very strong at 4.3 percent, while wholesale employment showed a decrease of 1.8 percent. The growth rate of wholesale employment has been slowing since 1994, with 1999 being the first  Arizona Economic Trends is published quarterly by the Arizona Department of Economic Security, Research Administration, by authority of the Wagner-Peyser Act and through funding provided by the U.S. Department of Labor.

In 1989, 16.4 (17.0 million) percent of employed workers were unionized. By 2002, this level had fallen to 13.2 (16.1 million) percent, a 3.2 percentage point loss. Within New England, each of the region's six states also reported significant declines in unionization. In 1989, both Connecticut (18.5%) and Massachusetts (17.5%) reported membership rates higher than the national average, followed by Maine (15.2%), Vermont (11.9%), and New Hampshire (11.6%). Since that time, each of these states have reported union membership rate declines in excess of Rhode Island's 1.5 percentage point loss. In 2002, 14.2 percent of Massachusetts workers were unionized, representing a 3.3 percentage point decline. Vermont's rate fell 2.4 percentage points to 9.5 percent during this period, with Maine (-2.3 percentage points) reporting a similar decline to 12.9 percent. Both New Hampshire (-1.9 percentage points) and Connecticut (-1.8 percentage points) experienced declines closer to that of the Ocean State as their membership rates fell to 9.7 percent and 16.7 percent, respectively. Today, Rhode Island's 17.2 percent membership rate makes it the most highly unionized state in the region and tenth highest in the United States, trailing New York (25.3%), Hawaii (24.4%), Alaska (24.3%), Michigan (21.1%), Illinois (19.6%), New Jersey (19.4%), Washington (18.4%), Minnesota (17.6%), and California (17.5%).

Carcieri Governor MarvinD.Perry Acting Director  Employment Bulletin Labor Market Information  Volume 15 No. 12 Rhode Island's Unemployment Rate Increases in November Following four successive months of declines, Rhode Island's unemployment rate increased 0.5 of a percentage point to 4.9 percent in November. The number of unemployed Rhode Island residents rose by 3,000 over the month to 27,800. A year ago, the unemployment rate was 5.4 percent and the jobless level stood at 30,400. The national jobless figure for November edged down to an eight month low of 5.9 percent. Rhode Island's unemployment rate remained below the national average for the twenty-eighth straight month. ""The number of jobs in Rhode Island showed little change over the month as labor market conditions remained soft,"" said DLT Acting Director Marvin D. Perry. ""The lack of sustained job growth to absorb the increasing number of Rhode Islanders seeking employment seems to have caused an upturn in our unemployment rate."" Rhode Island Job Highlights The Rhode Island job count stood at 480,900 in November. Rhode Island businesses reported a small gain of 200 jobs last month following declines of 1,700 in August, 700 in September and 400 in October. The November employment figure is down 2,600 from the July peak, but still up 1,200 since the beginning of the year. Over-the-month decreases were reported in five of the seven measured sectors with the greatest loss occurring in Trade, Transportation & Utilities (-1,500). Other sectors reporting over-the-month declines included Construction (-300), Professional & Business Services (-200), Leisure & Hospitality (-100) and Other Services (-100). Manufacturing and Government each posted increases of 300 jobs.

Year 181.3 1.8%  The more detailed unadjusted employment estimates increased by 700 over the month, reflecting the expected pre-holiday hiring in Retail Trade. The unadjusted job count for November stood at 488,100 compared to 487,400 in October. Seasonal gains were reflected in Retail Trade (+1,700), Government (+600) and Educational Services (+400). Several industries reported job losses typical for this time of year. The largest decreases were noted in Accommodation & Food Services (-700), Arts, Entertainment & Recreation (-600), Construction (-400) and Administrative & Waste Services (-400). Over the year, employment (unadjusted) was up 1,500 from the 486,600 jobs reported in November 2002. Increases in Health Care & Social Assistance (+1,400), Retail Trade (+1,200), Construction (+1,000) and Wholesale Trade (+800), overshadowed the major decreases reported in Manufacturing (-1,500), Professional & Technical Services (-700) and Educational Services (-600). The $12.99 average hourly wage earned by the Manufacturing sector's production workers in November 2003 represents a yearly gain of eighteen cents per hour and an over-the-month increase of six cents per hour. In November 2003, Manufacturing employees worked an average of 39.9 hours per week, up 0.4 of an hour from October and up 1.2 hours from November 2002.

Vermont's rate fell 2.4 percentage points to 9.5 percent during this period, with Maine (-2.3 percentage points) reporting a similar decline to 12.9 percent. Both New Hampshire (-1.9 percentage points) and Connecticut (-1.8 percentage points) experienced declines closer to that of the Ocean State as their membership rates fell to 9.7 percent and 16.7 percent, respectively. Today, Rhode Island's 17.2 percent membership rate makes it the most highly unionized state in the region and tenth highest in the United States, trailing New York (25.3%), Hawaii (24.4%), Alaska (24.3%), Michigan (21.1%), Illinois (19.6%), New Jersey (19.4%), Washington (18.4%), Minnesota (17.6%), and California (17.5%). Regional neighbors, including Connecticut (11th), Massachusetts (17th), Maine (23rd), New Hampshire (27th), and Vermont (28th), were all ranked lower in 2002.  Happy New Year!

Rural America USDA/ERS Volume 16, Issue 4 Winter 2002  Rural Transpor tation Updates on Poverty, Food Security, and Jobs   Rural America USDA/ERS Volume 16, Issue 4  Winter 2002  his issue of Rural America features two articles on rural transportation, which has seen significant change in the past quarter century. Eileen S. Stommes and Dennis M. Brown survey rural transportation over the last 25 years and discuss the implications of recent changes for rural policy. Deregulation has brought greater competition--especially for trucking--but rural rail and bus service has shrunk and air service has suffered in some rural areas. Major improvements in infrastructure will be necessary for rural roads, bridges, inland waterways, and airports. Devolution of some Federal regulatory functions to States has made community involvement in transportation planning more important. Next, Dennis M. Brown takes a closer look at inland waterways. Traversing the vast Mississippi River system as well as several shorter ones, barges are the low-cost carriers of over half the corn and soybeans exported, as well as large shares of wheat, sorghum, other grains, fuel, and fertilizers. Waterways also play a significant developmental role in many communities. Much of the lock and dam infrastructure is now aging and may require a considerable investment to upgrade. Popular perceptions of agriculture and its importance to the economy will certainly have an influence on the pending farm bill. Cheryl J. Wachenheim and Richard Rathge surveyed residents in the most agricultural part of the country, the North Central region, and found a high regard for farming and its importance overall. However, respondents living in towns or unfamiliar with livestock operations were most likely to be concerned with farming's impact on the environment. Respondents from counties losing population were the most likely to believe that agriculture played an important role in the local economy. The recent slowing of the U.S. economy has renewed concerns over the impacts of losing a major employer in a rural community. F. Larry Leistritz and Kenneth A. Root studied five communities in Minnesota and North Dakota that experienced such a loss between 1994 and 1998. The communities that coped best had strong local leadership, had a regional or local economic development agency, and had received advance warning of the impending closure. Communities with several important employers or with many commuting workers were better able to recover. Dean Jolliffe opens our Rural Updates section with a discussion of changing rural poverty rates. Between 1996 and 1999 the rural poverty rate declined from 15.9 to 14.2 percent, the lowest since 1979. Declines occurred in all regions and for all age groups. Although urban poverty dropped even faster--widening the rural-urban poverty gap--rural poverty became less severe as a higher proportion of the poor attained incomes within 75-99 percent of the poverty line. Food-insecure households are those not able to depend on the availability of enough food for an active and healthy life. Mark Nord's update of food security data for 2000 shows that 11.5 percent of nonmetro households (versus 10.2 percent of metro) fell into this category, almost unchanged from 1998. Food insecurity was especially high in Black and Hispanic households, in single-parent families, and among children. Poverty-related hunger affected 3.4 percent of nonmetro households. Nonfarm jobs increased just 1.5 percent in nonmetro areas during 1998-99, as reported by Linda M. Ghelfi, a rate below the 2.4 percent for metro areas and also less than the nonmetro growth rates earlier in the 1990s. Real earnings per nonfarm job also increased by 1.3 percent during 1998-99. Nonmetro workers now earn just 68.7 percent of metro earnings, the lowest ratio in more than 30 years. Peggy J. Cook provides new data on transfer payments, which are mainly social security, medicare, and medicaid funds. Rural areas received more transfer payments per capita than urban areas throughout the 1990s, and they accounted for a substantially greater portion of personal income. The growth rate for transfer payments fell in the late 1990s because of stronger earnings growth.  T  Douglas E.

Brown  n 1991, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) devolved much of the Federal highway planning to the States, which, along with local areas, own the vast majority (95 percent in 1997) of roads (fig. 1). ISTEA initiated a comprehensive planning process that enlisted local, State, tribal, and public/private interest groups, and emphasized stronger links between the environmental impact of transportation improvements on clean air and water quality. Furthermore, the Act sought to integrate community development with transportation enhancements. (Nonmetro funding under ISTEA is illustrated in figure 2.) The 1998 Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), ISTEA's successor legislation, reinforced State and local transportation roles and the broad strategic and oversight responsibilities of the Federal Government. The Surface Transportation program gave States and localities more flexibility in  I  In the last 25 years, transportation in rural America has been transformed by deregulation, devolution of Federal responsibilities to State and local governments, and traffic growth created by the booming economy of the 1990s. All modes of rural transportation--highways, passenger service (transit, intercity bus, and passenger rail service), trucking, inland waterways, rail freight service, and passenger air service--have been affected. By linking rural residents with distant jobs and services and by enabling commercial shipping, transportation is a cornerstone of rural economic development. However, rural transportation is still beset by higher commuting and shipping costs due to widely dispersed population and industry. on lower/local road classifications, many of which are in rural areas. Under ISTEA and TEA-21, each State was required to set up a statewide transportation planning process (incorporating environmenFigure 1 tal concerns and intermodal conRural public road maintenance, 1997 County, town, and municipal governments are nectivity), a transportation plan, and a transportation improvement responsible for 73 percent of rural roads program. States also were required Federal to include local governments as 5% well as other public and private State 22% organizations in the transportation planning process. While metro areas had Metropolitan Planning Organizations, rural areas previously had no organizational structure to carry out transportation planning. ISTEA and TEA-21 adopted a systemic approach to transportation that recognized its multiple functions, including its impact on the environment, the economy, and passenger and freight mobility. Yet, Local 10 years after ISTEA, several key 73% rural surface transportation issues remain.

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) continues to develop inclusive planning procedures to ensure local involvement. However, without such administrative procedures, rural areas may not receive either  the necessary funding or the statewide attention needed to maintain an adequate transportation infrastructure. Traffic levels have increased sharply throughout the United States since 1991. While congestion in metro regions has been amply publicized, many rural areas adjacent to metro areas and those with amenity-based economies also face increased traffic. More cars and  trucks add to local maintenance costs and detract from rural quality of life. Rural officials sometimes complain that State/Federal highways actually exacerbate these conditions (Brown et al.). Globalization of trade, as exemplified by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has created additional highway traffic along U.S. borders, along northsouth trade corridors, and around  3  Winter 2002/Volume 16, Issue 4  Rural America   Figure 3  Government outlays for transportation, 1980 and 1994 Most outlays come from State and local sources  31.3% 44.5%  55.5% 68.7%  1980 State and local Federal  1994  Source: Bureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S. Department of Transportation.  Intelligent Transportation Systems Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) apply advanced technologies including information processing, electronics, and communication, in combination with management strategies to improve overall transportation system operations. Federally funded rural ITS priorities under TEA-21 reflect rural conditions, namely longer local travel distances, lower traffic volumes, longer emergency response times, a sparse telecommunications infrastructure, and a dispersed overall system with high per-unit costs. Rural ITS applications include weather and road condition information for rural highway users, the use of automatic vehicle location and computer-aided dispatch systems for rural transit, automated collision notification, and better tourism/travel information to improve safety and security for users of rural transportation infrastructure.  4  major U.S. ports. Much of the spillover traffic uses the local road system, adding to the fiscal pressure on local governments to maintain or upgrade local roads. Federal highway outlays have increased, but State and local expenditures far surpass Federal spending (fig. 3). Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which employ new technologies to help solve transportation problems, are being emphasized under TEA-21 to enhance rural safety information and rural passenger transportation (see ""Intelligent Transportation  Systems""). ITS applications could be used to leverage existing transportation resources in rural communities. However, it may be necessary to increase Federal resources in new technology or facilitate innovative partnerships to apply ITS in rural areas.  Many Rural Areas Lack Passenger Service Rural passenger service is perhaps best described as a composite of separate programs, including rural transit, specialized services for the elderly and handicapped, and  transportation for those enrolled in human services programs. Intercity bus and passenger rail (Amtrak) also serve rural residents. Rural public transit, the rural analogue to bus service in metro areas, is available in approximately half of the rural counties nationwide, for a total of about 1,200 systems. These ""5311"" transit systems are county-based and tend to be found in the more populated rural areas (see ""Section 5310 and Section 5311 Transit Systems,"" p. 7). Few are found in the most rural, isolated areas (fig. 4). These systems range in size from 1 to over 50 vehicles. According to a recent survey, from 1994 to 1999, the average fleet size in rural areas increased by 60 percent, with ridership increasing by 62 percent (Community Transportation Association of America). Specialized transportation services for the elderly and persons with disabilities are available under the Section 5310 program. Federal funding is provided to private nonprofit groups and certain public organizations for capital expenses, including purchase-of-service agreements whereby an agency pays a transportation provider for services. There are approximately 3,700 of these systems throughout the country and they serve both urban and rural clients. Human service agencies often provide transportation. Some purchase vehicles and hire drivers, while others contract with rural transit operators. However, caseworker time, vehicle expenses, and contract costs are often not classified as transportation but rather as meeting the service needs of a particular client. Given client-based cost accounting, it is difficult to measure rural transportation as provided by human service agencies.  Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   Intercity bus transportation also provides mobility for rural residents. Deregulation of intercity bus service, under the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, relaxed entry requirements for bus/motorcoach companies. This has generally resulted in better long-haul service, more complete fare information, and a greater diversity of services, including enhanced charter and tour service. Yet this industry diversity comes at a price for rural residents. Data from the Department of Transportation indicate that more Figure 4  than 11,000 locations received intercity bus service in 1982, but only 5,000 communities were served in 2000. Many of those service reductions took place in rural areas, as bus companies were no longer required to cross-subsidize low-revenue routes with profits from high-revenue routes. Another change affecting rural transportation was brought about by the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). ADA requires public transportation providers to make transportation available to  individuals with disabilities, specifying requirements for transit systems as well as private, for-hire providers. ADA especially challenges rural transportation providers by adding to the cost of systems already hard pressed to serve geographically remote populations. Amtrak, a federally subsidized, for-profit corporation established in October 1970, provides another form of transportation for rural residents. Amtrak passenger service began in May 1971. However, only  Index of quality of rural public transit service The rural Midwest is well served by public transit  Above-average service Below-average service  5 Source: Community Transportation Association of America.  Winter 2002/Volume 16, Issue 4  Rural America   about half of all passenger routes were taken over by Amtrak, and many rural towns lost passenger rail service at that time. Although Amtrak offers a national network, it mainly links major metropolitan areas, with fewer than 200 nonmetro communities on its routes and minimal passenger rail connections with county transit systems. Amtrak is required by Congress to become operationally self-sufficient by 2003 (with capital grants continuing in the future). However, it is not clear whether Amtrak can operate without public subsidies.  serve the individual. A key issue is whether this assortment of county transit operations can be unified to provide a seamless system of transit beyond the local community. Third, intercity bus transportation is poorly linked with other types of county transit systems in much of rural America. While TEA21 provides funding to encourage intercity bus companies to ""interline"" with rural transit, those linkages are fairly limited, taking place in only a few nonmetro communities.  childcare arrangements, and keep a job. Although the Department of Transportation has funded the Job Access and Reverse Commute program to encourage innovative mobility options, pilot projects are just now getting underway, and hence, little information exists on their success at moving people to work reliably and efficiently.  Trucking Services Expanded Sharply Under Deregulation The Motor Carrier Act of 1935 brought trucks and buses under the regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). Agricultural commodities were exempted from regulation by this Act. By the mid-1970s, growing public concern about the inefficiency of regulating the motor carrier industry led the ICC to loosen entry requirements, and the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 further relaxed barriers to entry. Deregulation led to explosive growth in small trucking companies as the cost of entry declined. Existing carriers expanded into new territory, and new, smaller companies responded to market demand. Companies retired company-owned truck fleets and turned to independent, for-hire trucking firms for lower rates and improved service. Today, there are nearly 500,000 trucking companies in the Nation, with most owning 6 or fewer trucks (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2000). Trucking firms have become increasingly competitive since deregulation, offering more frequent service, smaller loads, and faster service times. ""Hub-andspoke"" systems have evolved to facilitate faster, more efficient delivery, aided by the Internet and computerized coordination of services and product purchases. Trucks can  Difficulties Remain in Serving Rural Transit Needs The current state of rural passenger transportation highlights several issues that may affect successful implementation of other Federal programs. First, countylevel duplication of federally funded transportation services exists alongside some remote rural counties with little or no coverage. Coordinating the many funding sources and reporting requirements unique to each federally funded program has given rise to the Federal Coordinating Council for Access and Mobility (CCAM), which brings together the relevant agencies within DOT and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Second, although rural transit may meet the mobility needs of the local traveler, service often stops at the county line, creating a disconnect that leads to a balkanized rural transit system. For example, an individual using a county-based transit system to visit a medical facility in another county cannot connect seamlessly with another county-based transit system--the two county transit systems must establish a special connection to  Although Amtrak offers a national network, it mainly links major metropolitan areas, with fewer than 200 nonmetro communities on its routes and minimal passenger rail connections with county transit systems.  6  Fourth, rural passenger transportation has become increasingly important since welfare reform was enacted in 1996. Nationally, fewer than 1 in 10 recipients of public assistance owns a car, and nearly 40 percent of the 10 million daily public transit riders are considered low-income. Nationally, one in four families receiving public assistance lives in a rural area, and a disproportionate share of rural residents lives in poverty-level households. However, the limitations of existing transit in terms of scheduling and routing may impede the ability of welfare recipients to obtain employment, make necessary  Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   now transport an assortment of products to several customers, feeding just-in-time inventory systems (McMullen). Two motor carrier issues of particular importance remain for rural areas. First, an increasing number of highway fatalities have involved large trucks. The Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 created the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to increase roadside inspections, conduct compliance reviews, increase education, and better monitor new drivers. Second, the trucking boom has increased the cost of road maintenance for local governments, which maintain 80 percent of rural roads. Larger trucks increase wear and tear on an aging rural road and bridge system designed for lighter, smaller vehicles. One study estimates additional costs of heavy truck damage ranging from an average of $0.075 per ton-mile for county/local roads to $0.05 per ton-mile for State roads (U.S. Department of Agriculture). To reduce road costs, rural areas have instituted year-round and seasonal weight restrictions, limited-access postings, and tax increases to meet road maintenance needs.  Inland Waterways Ship Bulk Commodities Cheaply The national inland waterway system--including the Mississippi River and its tributaries, the Snake River-Columbia River system, and the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway--provides a low-cost, effective means of transporting bulk products over long distances. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is charged with maintaining and improving the waterway system as well as balancing the interests of all user groups. The inland waterway system is important for agriculture, particularly the export grain industry. It is the cheapest means of transporting bulk, low-value products. Further, barge rates are not subject to regulation by the Federal Government, allowing barge companies to price according to market demand. In 1996, approximately 54 percent of all U.S. corn exports and 40 percent of all soybean exports moved by barge along the Illinois and Mississippi River systems to export elevators on the Gulf Coast. U.S. bulk-grain exports are highly competitive in the global marketplace because the U.S. transportation system efficiently moves bulk com-  Section 5310 and Section 5311 Transit Systems Section 5310 of the Federal Transit Act authorizes capital assistance to States for transportation systems serving the elderly and persons with disabilities. States, in turn, distribute the funding in both rural and urban areas to nonprofit organizations or lead agencies in coordinated transportation programs. Funding cannot be used for operating expenses, only for capital expenses. Section 5311 of the Federal Transit Act is a formula grant program that authorizes both capital and operating assistance grants to public transit systems in areas with populations of less than 50,000. The Federal share for capital and administrative expenses is 80 percent and the local share is 20 percent; the Federal share of operating expenses is up to 50 percent.  modities from the interior of the Nation to export destinations. Some farm groups are concerned that waterway infrastructure improvements in grain-producing competitor nations, including China and Argentina, may erode the U.S. price advantage in world grain markets (U.S. Department of Agriculture). Today, the traditional commercial use of the marine transportation system--and the U.S. inland waterway system in particular-- is facing a number of challenges from its diverse users. A Corps of Engineers study of the Upper Mississippi River-Illinois River system, comprised of locks and dams originally constructed during the 1930s, was initiated in 1993 to determine its structural needs over the next 50 years. As this ongoing study has progressed, the Corps has seen its economic assumptions and modeling challenged by environmentalists, recreational users, and agricultural interests. Other than routine maintenance of existing infrastructure (locks and dams), new construction awaits a longterm plan based on the study findings. A recent National Academy of Sciences technical review of the study urged the Corps to consider less costly ways to alleviate barge traffic, including barge tolls and better scheduling. At present, the evolving nature of this debate means that rural implications remain unclear.  Deregulation Spurs Railroad Consolidation Faced with increased competition from the trucking industry, inland waterway transportation, and pipelines, the national rail network has been steadily shrinking from 254,000 miles in 1916 to 171,000 miles by 1997, a 33-per-  7  Winter 2002/Volume 16, Issue 4  Rural America   8  cent reduction (U.S. Department of Transportation, 1999). This trend became more pronounced with the passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which deregulated the rail freight industry. Before deregulation, rail infrastructure had been overbuilt, but Federal regulation had required railroads to maintain both track and service levels, regardless of their profitability. With deregulation, carriers aggressively streamlined rail infrastructure (track, railyards, and stations) to reduce unprofitable routes and consolidated operations to improve their profitability, resulting in a high degree of concentration among Class I railroad companies, or those with annual revenues of at least $250 million. Unlike the trucking industry, which has relatively low fixed costs, the railroad industry, which owns and maintains the track, has high startup costs. Consequently, deregulation in the railroad industry has largely resulted in consolidation among existing railroads. By 1998, there were fewer than 10 Class I railroads, down from over 100 in 1960. In recent years, Federal regulators have approved several major railroad mergers. Mergers have resulted in abandonment of unprofitable rural track, leading to loss of rail service in rural communities. As a consequence, these consolidations have sometimes disrupted rail service, an issue of particular concern for agriculture and other raildependent industries. The risks for agricultural and rural communities of decreased rail freight competition may be significant when areas served by two railroads lose one of their lines due to a consolidation. Consequently, in June 2001, the Surface Transportation Board, the Federal agency responsible for  overseeing railroad mergers, issued new rules for mergers involving two or more Class I railroads. These new rules increase the burden on merger/consolidation applicants to demonstrate that the proposed action would be in the public interest, particularly that the new, merged operation would enhance competition for rates and services for smaller railroads, ports, and passenger and commuter services. Consolidation in the rail freight industry has led to the growth of short-line and regional railroads (collectively referred to as ""small railroads""), which usually operate on lighter density lines abandoned by major railroads. Since the railroad industry was deregulated in 1980, small railroads have been established in many rural areas, helping to mitigate the negative effects of mergers. By 1996, small Figure 5  railroads accounted for about a third of all rail route miles in the Nation, 9 percent of the rail industry's total freight revenue, and 11 percent of railroad employment nationwide. Loss of rural rail service also has increased truck traffic on rural roads. While competition from trucking may have helped keep rail rates down, it has resulted in greater deterioration of rural roads, most of which are funded by local governments. In fact, increases in freight traffic have occurred across all transportation modes serving rural America since the early 1960s (fig. 5).

Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   Act of 1978. This legislation eliminated the Civil Aeronautics Board and allowed air carriers to enter and exit markets and adopt rate structures of their own choosing. To ensure continued service to smaller and more isolated communities, the legislation established the Essential Air Service program, which provides subsidies directly to airlines to maintain service to those small communities that were served at the time of deregulation. This program, with an annual funding level of $50 million, supports scheduled air service to more than 100 rural communities, mainly in the Midwest, the Rocky Mountain States, and Alaska. Deregulation of the domestic airline system resulted in a sharp increase in overall domestic airline traffic, with air carriers concentrating their operations around hub airports. Deregulation has transformed the level and types of service provided to all communities. Some rural communities have experienced significant declines in their air service, while others have benefited from increased service, and still others have experienced relatively stable service since 1978. Much of this is determined simply by passenger demand. On average, airline deregulation has been a boon to the flying public, producing lower fares and expanded service. With the development of ""hub-and-spoke"" networks, many small communities receive better service than before deregulation because they are connected by nonstop flights to hub airports that offer nonstop services throughout the country. Moreover, the number of communities throughout the Nation served by more than one carrier has grown with deregulation. In many cases, the equipment is better matched to  Photo courtesy AMTRAK Public Affairs, Washington, DC.  the levels of traffic in individual communities and has resulted in qualitative improvements such as greater flight frequencies and better connecting opportunities. These improvements, however, are not universal. Although many community leaders feel that airline service is critical to the rural economy, the relationship between airports and rural development is uncertain. While some studies show that airports spur local economic development, especially in the high-tech sector (Reeder and Wanek), the strength of the relationship appears to vary depending on local factors, including industry mix, the diversity of the economy, the existing regional transportation infrastructure, and local employment level. Furthermore, while most studies of business location choices do not identify the availability of local scheduled air service as an important factor influencing location decisions, business and community leaders often cite lack of convenient, affordable air service as a disadvantage of rural business locations (Gale and Brown). Authorized funding for airport construction and development was sharply increased in early 2000 under the $40 billion Aviation  Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR-21), a 3-year bill that increases aviation investment by $10 billion over previous levels. Most of the money will be used for radar modernization and airport construction. AIR-21 also authorized a number of provisions covering airports in small communities, including increased funding for nonhub airports, the development of an incentive-based program that helps airlines buy jets to serve small airports, and the creation of a new funding program to help small, underserved airports market and promote their air service. However, to date, Congress has not appropriated any funds to carry out the latter two programs. Several airline competition and quality-of-service issues remain. DOT recently examined whether anticompetitive practices by major carriers stifle competition from small, startup airlines, which are important in many rural areas. DOT also has been investigating other competition-related practices at airports and among major airlines, including whether airport landing fees and the spending practices of major carriers put small airlines at a disadvantage. Some contend that rural areas have been hurt by the tightening of  9  Winter 2002/Volume 16, Issue 4  Rural America   safety and maintenance standards on commuter aircraft that serve 10 or more passengers--the so-called Commuter Safety Rule. More stringent Federal safety standards may have contributed to the loss of air service for some small communities as the costs of operating commuter air service have increased. Many commuter airlines phased out their 19-seat aircraft in favor of larger planes that are not as well suited to small rural markets.  Conclusions Transportation in rural areas today is still in transition after a quarter century of deregulation, Federal devolution, and significant traffic increases across all modes. Deregulation has in fact created significant benefits for rural areas. Rural areas are better served by the airlines, a more efficient rail system, an expanded trucking system, and increased charter bus tour opportunities. Federal devolution of transportation policy through ISTEA and TEA-21 has given States and local governments increased authority over transportation planning and funding decisions.  Not all changes, however, have benefited rural America. Some feel air service levels in remote rural areas have declined; a streamlined rail system has left many rural areas with reduced or no rail service; trucking safety concerns remain and road maintenance costs have risen; bus deregulation led to fewer rural bus stops. While ISTEA and TEA-21 gave maximum planning flexibility to States and local governments, rural community involvement in planning and funding transportation continues to evolve.

Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   The Nation's Inland Waterway System and Rural America Dennis M. Brown  y facilitating the reciprocal movement of farm commodities and inputs, such as grain and fertilizer, the U.S. inland waterway system is crucial to the Nation's agricultural sector. Its vital role is underscored by the fact that most of the Nation's agricultural production occurs inland, far from both domestic and foreign markets. Covering more than 25,000 miles of navigable inland waterways (fig. 1), the system contains: (1) the Mississippi River and its tributaries; (2) the Columbia - Snake River system; (3) the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence Seaway; and (4) other rivers, canal systems, and coastal waterways. Mississippi River--Stretching over 2,300 miles from its source in Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico, this river is central to the Nation's waterway transportation system, providing a critical link for the movement of bulk commodities. The Mississippi is comprised of two separate components--an upper portion, upstream from St. Louis, and a lower section downstream. Locks and dams are almost exclusively on the Upper Mississippi,  B  The Nation's inland waterway system--the internal network of rivers and the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence Seaway, plus coastal waterways--provides a low-cost means of transporting bulky goods over long distances. Inland waterways, critical in moving farm commodities, inputs, and other raw materials, face a number of challenges. These include the deterioration of many locks and dams, particularly on the Upper Mississippi - Illinois River system, and the controversy over the best use of the waterway system in the Pacific Northwest.  Dennis M. Brown is a regional economist in the Rural Business and Development Policy Branch of the Food and Rural Economics Division, ERS.  between Minneapolis and St. Louis, because this portion is less navigable in its natural state than the lower section of the river. Large-scale commercial use of the river began in the early 19th century (Fruin and Baumel), but its utility was soon overshadowed by the Erie Canal, which was completed in 1825 and facilitated the east-west movement of goods. Previously, goods were moved down the Mississippi through New Orleans and subsequently routed through New York City. Competition from the railroads, along with the difficulties of navigating an unpredictable river, kept the Mississippi relatively unused until the early 20th century. By the 1930s, the Mississippi re-emerged as an important route for freight traffic. During the Great Depression, the Federal Government undertook a massive construction project consisting of 28 locks and dams on the Upper Mississippi. This, along with dredging, greatly enhanced navigability of the waterway. Locks and dams  were also constructed on many of the Mississippi's main tributaries, including the Illinois, Ohio, and Arkansas Rivers. Navigability on the Missouri River, another important tributary, was enhanced by straightening portions of it downstream from Sioux City, Iowa. Today, agricultural products, in particular, corn and soybeans, are the primary commodities transported on the Mississippi, accounting for over half of all tonnage shipped on the upper portion (Casavant). In 1996, nearly 55 percent of total U.S. corn exports and 40 percent of soybean exports were transported by barges on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. Other important commodities served by this waterway system include fertilizer, coal, steel, cement, and petroleum products (Bertels, 1998b). Having expanded its original infrastructure facilities, the Upper Mississippi currently has 29 dams with 35 lock chambers (Casavant). The Illinois River, which flows into the Upper Mississippi just above St. Louis, has an additional 8 locks.  11  Winter 2002/Volume 16, Issue 4  Rural America   Figure 1  Major river systems in the U.S. The Mississippi is the Nation's most important waterway Columbi a  Willamette Snake  Missouri  Wisconsi n North Platte Platte Illinois Arkansas Tennessee  Hudson Ohio  Mississippi Red Canadian  Alabam a  Chattahoochee  Source: Prepared by the Economic Research Service.  12  The average age of this infrastructure is approaching 60 years on the Upper Mississippi and is several years older on the Illinois (Bertels, 1998b). Consequently, design capacities for some locks and dams have already been reached. For example, current capabilities in the barge ""towing"" industry allow a single towboat to push a tow of 15 barges, which is approximately 1,200 feet in length. However, only three locks are currently long enough to handle such tows. The remainder of the locks have 600-  foot chambers, so each tow must be separated and ""double-locked,"" which is costly, time-consuming, and increases congestion on the waterway. Columbia - Snake River--This waterway, which flows through large portions of Idaho and Washington and forms the northern border of Oregon, has 8 locks and 8 dams originally developed for hydroelectric production in the early 1900s. The waterway's completion in 1975 opened up interior points in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho to commercial barge traffic.  Agricultural products, mostly wheat, generally move downstream on this river system, and account for 40 percent of all shipments (by weight) in an average year (Casavant). Forest products, which also usually move downstream, account for 15-22 percent of all tonnage shipped. Fuels and fertilizers usually move upstream and account for over 80 percent of upriver traffic (Lee and Casavant). Great Lakes - St. Lawrence Seaway--Shared with Canada, this system comprises the five Great Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron,  Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   Erie, and Ontario) and the St. Lawrence River, and stretches over 2,000 miles from Minnesota to the Atlantic Ocean. Agricultural products account for about 40 percent of all its trade, with most grain products destined for export. Agricultural commodities shipped include wheat, corn, soybeans, barley, oats, and flaxseed. The St. Lawrence Seaway was completed in 1959 at a cost of about $1 billion and provided Midwestern locations direct access to overseas markets (Fruin and Baumel). Comprised of a series of locks on the St. Lawrence River and Welland Canal (which connects Lake Erie to Lake Ontario), the system allows oceangoing vessels and ""lakers"" (ships primarily confined to the Great Lakes) a direct route from Duluth, Minnesota, at the western end of Lake Superior, to the Atlantic Ocean. Other Major Components--The Tennessee - Tombigbee River system flows through Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. In the 1970s and 1980s, a series of locks and dams was constructed on the Tennessee and Tombigbee Rivers, which opened up a 230-mile, 9-foot deep channel, and provided barges from Appalachia with access to the Gulf of Mexico (Fruin and Baumel). In addition, the New York State Barge Canal System connects Lake Ontario to the Hudson River. And, although not technically part of the inland waterway system, the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway make up the Intracoastal Waterway System, which connects ports along the eastern and southern coasts of the Nation. It provides a protected route for a variety of ships, including pleasure craft and small commercial vessels, and stretches from Boston, Massachusetts, to Browns-  ville, Texas, with the Gulf section heavily used by the petroleum industry.  The Federal Role in the Inland Waterway System The role of the Federal Government has historically been to build and maintain the system of locks, dams, and channels (Bronzini). Low-cost water transportation, it was argued, served the interests of society as a whole and hence should be exclusively funded by the Federal Government. The funding situation changed when the Inland Waterways Trust Fund was set up in 1980 to receive and disburse funds collected by a newly imposed fuel tax on barge companies. The tax is currently set at 20 cents per gallon and is designed to pay a portion (usually 50 percent) of the cost of modernizing locks, although current infrastructure needs are probably greater than the available trust fund money. The remainder of  infrastructure funding typically comes from Treasury funds, appropriated to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees such projects. Operation and maintenance costs for locks, dams, and dredging are also usually paid for by the Federal Government (Bertels, 1998b). The barge industry has benefited greatly from this Federal investment in waterways. Barges, which operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by very low barriers to entry, transport over half of domestically produced grains and oilseeds destined for export, about 67.6 million tons in 1995 (fig. 2) (Eriksen et al.). Barge transportation is less important in the domestic grain and oilseed market, accounting for about 6 million tons or 3 percent of domestic shipments. Altogether, barge transportation accounted for about 19 percent of all grain and oilseed shipments in 1995, a ratio largely unchanged since the late 1970s.  Figure 2  Modal shares of grain and soybean shipments, 1995 Barge transportation is most important in the export grain and soybean market 11.1% 2.5%  41.1% 50.9% 38.1% 56.4%  Export Barge Rail  Domestic Truck  Note: Totals may not add up to 100 percent due to rounding.

If each mode is to be used to best advantage, the entire transportation network must be optimized. If any link in the system is underfunded, then the entire network suffers.  Inland Waterways Reduce Costs, Encourage Development 40  20  0 Corn Soybeans Barge Source: Eriksen et al.  Barley and Rye Rail  Wheat Truck  Sorghum  14  Barge transportation is most important in the export corn and export soybean markets, where it accounted for 58 percent and 66 percent of shipments in 1995 (fig. 3). Most corn and soybeans are grown near the Mississippi River system. Barge transportation is also important in the barley, rye, wheat, and sorghum export markets. With the Federal Government's investment in waterways, the barge industry, some argue, has unfairly benefited from a public subsidy (Bronzini). The railroad industry, in particular, has cited its competitive disadvantage as a result of the continued public support of the Nation's inland waterway infrastructure. The waterway industry counters that railroads massively  benefited from the granting of public lands by the Government in the 19th century, and that rail labor benefits from public subsidies of the Railroad Retirement System. Sussman summarizes the argument for continued public support this way: ""Given the close ties between the waterways and the Nation's resource base and the lack of a private sector entity that could effectively provide and manage the physical facilities that support navigation, it seems reasonable to conclude that the Federal Government will be heavily involved in this system for many decades to come."" Nearly all commodities that use the waterway system use multiple modes of transportation, including trucking, rail, or pipelines. For  Inland waterways offer a number of economic benefits. According to one study, economic activity on the waterway system creates an estimated $4 billion in Federal tax revenue (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1995). An estimated 800,000 jobs in the agriculture, manufacturing, and mining industries are linked to the origination or receipt of barge-oriented shipments (Mercer Management Consulting). The inland barge industry annually moves some 1 billion barrels of petroleum products and 450 million barrels of chemicals to domestic users or terminals, with 169 million tons of coal and 94 million tons of farm and food products transported on inland waterways in 1995 (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1996). These all are important industries in rural America. Since the early 1960s, domestic shipments on inland rivers have generally increased, while those on the Great Lakes have declined (fig. 4). By 1997, domestic waterborne commerce on all components of the inland waterway system accounted for over 738 million short tons (a short ton is equivalent to 2,000 pounds) of freight shipments, representing about 70 percent of all domestic waterborne freight shipments in the Nation. The remainder is made up of  Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   coastal, intraport, and intraterritorial shipments. One of the main advantages of waterway transportation is its very low rate structure, averaging 0.73 cent per ton-mile in 1995, versus 2.49 cents for railroads, the next cheapest transportation mode (Haulk). This low rate structure fosters competition and exerts downward pressure on the rates of alternative modes of transportation, most notably rail. The waterways' cost effectiveness enables export price advantages for some U.S. exports. For example, corn produced in Iowa cost $2.33 per bushel to grow and harvest in 1996, compared with $1.33 per bushel in Argentina. However, after domestic transportation, the cost  of Argentine corn delivered to the mouth of the Plata River increases to $3.21 per bushel, compared with $3.01 per bushel for U.S. corn delivered to the Gulf of Mexico (Haulk). Waterways offer a number of other benefits. The inland navigation system is, by far, the safest mode of transportation. For example, the death rate for barge tows in 1993 was 0.01 death per billion ton-miles, compared with 0.84 for trucks and 1.15 for railroads (Haulk). And barges are more than 200 times safer than railroads in terms of injuries. Barges tend to operate in less congested environments than other freight transportation modes and their slow speeds typically allow other water-  Figure 4  Domestic waterborne commerce on inland rivers and Great Lakes, 1960-99 Freight shipments increased on inland rivers, decreased on the Great Lakes Shipments (million tons) 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0  1960  1965  1970  1975  1980  1985  1990  1995  1999  Inland rivers  Great Lakes  way users sufficient time to avoid accidents. The waterway system also offers various environmental advantages. Barge transportation not only emits fewer hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide per ton-mile than rail or trucking, but pollutants tend to be emitted in more remote locations, which further reduces the impact of pollution on population centers (U.S. Department of Transportation). Waterways can promote rural economic development in a number of ways. The system of locks and dams provides reliable, yearround sources of water supply for local communities, and can mitigate floods. Waterways enable private boating and commercial use by the gambling and pleasure cruise industry. Waterfront property can accelerate residential and commercial development in many areas. Finally, about 50 lockassociated dams nationwide have hydroelectric power capabilities. Potential benefits of the waterway system must be balanced with associated costs. For example, commercial and recreational use of the waterway system has raised environmental concerns over fish and wildlife populations, water quality, streambeds, and shorelines. Although this increasingly contentious issue often focuses on the Upper Mississippi, it affects many navigable waterways throughout the Nation. Moreover, undertaking improvements to the waterway system can impair the recreational value and scenic beauty of some natural areas, degrade wildlife habitat, increase turbidity of water, interrupt fishing, and increase flooding in some low-lying areas.  15 Source: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Waterborne Commerce of the United States, 1999.

Photo courtesy USDA/ERS.  Also, the commercial use of waterways requires a number of special considerations. Because barge transportation is very slow, averaging only 6 miles per hour, products that require either rapid or precise scheduling requirements, such as high-value or differentiated commodities, may opt to use faster modes of transportation. And because rivers rarely travel in straight lines, point-to-point distances for barge transportation are usually greater than for other modes, although this disadvantage is usually overcome by low rates. Barge transportation can be affected by lock and dam delays. And waterways tend to be more directly affected by adverse weather conditions than railroads, particularly in the north where the inland waterway system is unusable for 3-4 months during the winter.  Challenges Facing the Inland Waterway System Inland waterways face a number of pressing challenges, infrastructure foremost among them. With over 170 lock sites and 210 lock chambers nationwide, many facilities are in various stages of disrepair (Casavant). In particular, the system of locks and dams on  16  the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, mostly constructed between 1930 and 1950, is aging. Also, many Upper Mississippi locks cannot fully meet the needs of current barge traffic. The Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for routine maintenance of navigation channels, including dredging and channel widening. However, upgrading and repairing the system can cost $100 million or more per lock. Mississippi River Lock 26, near Alton, Illinois, was replaced in 1994 at a cost of $950 million. Whether the benefits of the projects justify the costs--and determining who should fund the projects--has been the subject of much public debate. Since 1993, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been reviewing the long-term structural needs of the Mississippi River system. As of this writing, the outcome of this debate is still unresolved. Also uncertain is the future status of four dams on the Lower Snake River. Some have argued for ""breaching"" (or removing) the dams, or constructing bypasses to allow salmon to reach spring breeding sites further downstream. At this debate's core is the question of the river's primary use. Is it mainly  a low-cost transportation waterway that brings grain to northwestern export elevators, a source of hydroelectric power, or a natural resource harboring endangered species of salmon? Waterways throughout the Nation, most notably Maine's Kennebec River, have had dams removed in recent years when the environmental benefits of breaching were thought to outweigh commercial benefits. Railroad capacity issues also affect use of the Nation's inland waterway system. Stemming from deregulation of the railroad industry in 1980 under the Staggers Rail Act, rail carriers have recently initiated aggressive restructuring to improve their profitability, which has engendered a high degree of concentration among major (Class I) railroads. These consolidations have resulted in several notable disruptions of rail service in recent years. For example, traffic flows along the rail network were severely disrupted in mid-1997 and 1998 when the largest rail freight company, Union Pacific, experienced difficulties in absorbing operations of the Southern Pacific railroad, following its merger in 1996. As bulk shippers shifted to other transportation modes, waterways experienced heavier traffic volumes. This has been of particular concern for agriculture and other raildependent industries. Globalization is another issue increasingly affecting the Nation's inland waterways. By one estimate, total agricultural trade with Mexico has increased by over 50 percent since the institution of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 (Casavant). In recent years, this increased commerce has created transportation bottlenecks along the U.S.-Mexico border, at times disrupting rail and  Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   truck service. Some have speculated that the Mississippi River may become a new outlet for Canadian grain destined for international markets, such as Mexico (Casavant). Future use of the inland waterway system will continue to be affected by factors external to the  domestic waterway transportation industry. For example, foreign competitors in the grain and oilseed trade--primarily Argentina, Brazil, and China--are undertaking significant improvements in their domestic transportation systems (Bertels, 1998a). The loss of a U.S. cost  advantage deriving from the inland waterway system may reduce demand for shippers using America's inland waterways. And, as of this writing, it is still unclear how the incidents of Sept. 11, 2001 will affect the waterway system.  RA  For Further Reading . . . Paul J.

Wachenheim Richard Rathge  lthough competitive market forces mainly determine the mix of productive activities in a given region, individuals, interest groups, government agencies, and others also influence the type, structure, and practices of local industry. Legislation governing the conduct of industry participants is supposed to be designed to reflect the best interests of all constituents. Therefore, policymakers must know what the preferences and perceptions are. In developing agricultural policy, policymakers have traditionally relied on input from farmers and their interest groups. Accordingly, the literature has focused on the farm policy goals of those directly involved in production agriculture. However, as farmers have become  Inhabitants of the North Central region have a favorable view of agriculture, regarding farmers as beneficial to the local economy and good environmental stewards. Survey respondents felt that existing environmental regulations are appropriate; that consolidation of agriculture will hurt the environment, society, and local economies; and that government should do more to help local farmers stay in business. Rural nonfarm residents, versus those residing on a farm or in a town or city, were more convinced of farmers' positive impact on the local economy, but were less concerned about the effect of farm consolidation.  Cheryl J. Wachenheim is an assistant professor in the Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics and Richard Rathge is a professor in the Departments of Agribusiness and Applied Economics and Sociology, North Dakota State University, Fargo. Richard Rathge is also director of the North Dakota State Data Center. This research was supported by the Grants in Aid Program (grant no. 1119), administered by the Office of Research at North Dakota State University and by the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station. The questionnaire was designed and implemented by the North Dakota State Data Center.  fewer and rural residents are increasingly removed from the daily activities of production agriculture, nonfarm residents have become more prominent in farm and environmental policy. Their knowledge, perceptions, and policy goals are increasingly solicited, but are somewhat unknown. Most of the existing literature considers individual States, narrowly defined issues (e.g., the environmental impact of production agriculture), or a narrow set of individuals (e.g., high school students). In one exception, Roper Starch Worldwide, Inc., compared perceptions of consumers with those of farmers and found a surprising lack of knowledge among consumers regarding modern agricultural production practices. While consumer perceptions often paralleled farmers', the level of concern about the impact of farming was often much higher among consumers. It is no longer possible to ignore mounting evidence that rural nonfarm residents care about the impact of agriculture on their econ-  omy and the environment. Their input in the agricultural policy process is likely to continue to increase. Furthermore, as rural communities expand through residential development, the resulting mix of rural nonfarm residents may be both more aware of, and less familiar with, production agriculture. This study solicited perceptions about agriculture and identified how those perceptions differ based on the occupation/situation of North Central residents. The North Central region was selected because it contains the highest share of farm-dependent counties, those from which more than 20 percent of proprietor earnings come from agriculture.  Overall Perceptions of Agriculture Were Positive The majority of respondents strongly agreed that farmers have a positive impact on their local economy (71 percent); noise, odor, and other environmental issues associated with farming in their area are minimal (62 percent); the loss of  Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   Table 1  Responses to statements regarding farming Overall, respondents had a favorable view of farmers Statement Mean Strongly Disagreed Strongly Agreed  Percentage of valid responses Farmers have a positive impact on the local economy in my area Most of the agricultural supplies (e.g., seeds, fertilizers, feed) used by farmers in my area are purchased locally Loss of farmers in the region will greatly hurt our local economy The government should do more to help farmers in this area stay in business Farmers in this region are creating an environmental concern that should be addressed The noise, odor, and other environmental issues associated with farming in this area are minimal In farming areas, nonfarm residents need to become accustomed to the noise, odor, and other concerns associated with farming Environmental protection laws regulating farming practices are too strict As residential development of cities/towns moves closer to farming areas, more restrictive ordinances regarding noise, odor, and other environmental concerns should be allowed There should be no restrictions on the size of livestock operations even though they may be in close proximity to residential development of cities/towns or public recreational areas The replacement of smaller family farms in this area by large-scale farms using hired labor will have an undesirable economic and social consequence Poor economic conditions will likely lead to the replacement of family farms in this area by large farms run by hired labor More environmental concerns are created by large-scale farms using hired labor than by small family farms 4.46 4.02 4.13 3.99 2.69 4.29 3.86 3.04 2.57 3.8 5.2 9.6 8.6 32.0 5.6 7.1 14.7 31.2 70.9 47.4 61.8 51.5 19.7 62.4 41.2 18.6 12.3  2.70  24.7  15.5  3.87  6.5  44.9  3.84 4.06  8.3 4.9  43.2 49.1  Note: Means are based on a Likert scale with 1 being ""strongly disagree"" and 5 being ""strongly agree.""

Forty-seven percent  strongly agreed most agricultural supplies used by farmers are purchased locally. Respondents tended to be negative about evolving farm structure. Nearly half strongly agreed that  large-scale farms create more environmental concerns (49 percent) and that their replacement of smaller farms will have undesirable economic and social consequences (45 percent).  19  Winter 2002/Volume 16, Issue 4  Rural America   Perceptions Differ Depending on Location and Association with Livestock Social and physical distance from production agriculture can influence perception. Differences in perception can result, for example, from unfamiliarity with farm practices (Thelen). In the current study, we investigated whether the experience or residence of respondents influenced their perceptions and found they did. How agriculture is perceived differed among farm, rural nonfarm, and city or town residents; between those with a livestock association and others; and between those residing in a county that is rural versus nonrural, farm-dependent versus nonfarmdependent, or growing versus declining in population. We discuss differences in perceptions between these groups in three areas: the environmental impact of production agriculture and its appropriate regulation, perceptions about the changing structure of production agriculture, and the economic impact of production agriculture on local communities.  Environmental Impact of Greatest Concern to Those Further Removed from Farming Overall, respondents indicated that farmers are good environmental stewards and that existing environmental regulations are appropriate. Sixty-two percent of respondents minimized the significance of environmental issues associated with farming; 41 percent strongly agreed that, in farming areas, nonfarm residents need to become accustomed to noise, odor, and other concerns associated with farming (table 1). More respondents strongly disagreed (32 and 31 percent, respectively) than strongly agreed (20 and 12 percent) that  20  farmers are creating an environmental concern and that more restrictive ordinances should be imposed to address environmental concerns as residential development moves closer to farming. Although this supports the perception of farmers as good environmental stewards among residents of the North Central region, differences in perception were at times substantial. Perceptions of farmers' environmental stewardship differed by locale (table 2). Farm residents were less apt than city residents to think farmers were creating an environmental concern, more apt to minimize environmental issues associated with farming, and more inclined to find laws regulating farming practices too strict (table 2). Farmers were more apt (mean level of agreement was higher) than other rural and city residents to feel that nonfarm residents need to become accustomed to concerns related to farming and less apt to favor more restrictive ordinances as residential development moves closer to farming. Finally, farm residents were more likely to favor no restrictions on the size of livestock operations, regardless of locale. Given the distinct perceptions of individuals grouped by residence, it was surprising that perceptions about agriculture and the environment did not differ between residents of counties with differing rural classifications (table 3). If anything, those in nonrural counties (with an urban population of more than 20,000 or more than 2,500 and adjacent to a metropolitan area) are more supportive of agriculture's role in the environment, though it is not clear why. There were few differences in perception between residents of farm-dependent versus nonfarm-  dependent counties (table 4). In general, those in farm-dependent counties more strongly agreed that there were environmental concerns associated with farming and less strongly agreed that there should be additional restrictions under residential development, although the numeric differences were not statistically significant. Those in farmdependent counties less strongly agreed that there should be no restrictions on the size of livestock operations. The difference was significant. Residents living in counties that had gained population over the past two decades more strongly agreed than those in counties losing population that farmers in the region were creating an environmental concern that should be addressed (table 5). And, while population-gain counties more strongly favored restrictive ordinances as residential areas develop, they also more strongly opposed restrictions on the size of livestock operations regardless of proximity. Livestock farmers (those receiving some portion of their net income from or having worked with livestock within the past 5 years) more strongly disagreed that environmental issues associated with farming exist, that additional environmental legislation is necessary, and that more strict ordinances should be allowed as rural areas develop (table 6). They were more likely to agree that environmental issues associated with farming are minimal, that nonfarm residents need to become accustomed to farming practices, that environmental protection laws regulating farming practices are too strict, and that there should be no limit on the size of livestock operations regardless of their proximity to urban development.

Rathge, A Survey of Residents of the North Central Region, 2000.  25  Winter 2002/Volume 16, Issue 4  Rural America   There were similar perceptions when the livestock group was defined as livestock associates, those individuals associated with another who works or has worked on a livestock farm. However, unlike livestock farmers, livestock associates did not differ from other respondents in mean level of agreement that environmental concerns associated with farming are minimal.  Farm Size Seen As a Potential Problem North Central respondents generally believe that poor economic conditions will likely lead to the replacement of family farms by larger farms and that this will have undesirable consequences. Twothirds of respondents agreed that poor economic conditions will likely mean displacement of family farms in their area by large farms run by hired labor; only 19 percent disagreed. Sixty-four percent agreed that such displacement will have undesirable economic and social consequences; only 16 percent disagreed. Finally, nearly three-fourths of respondents thought that large farms using hired labor create more environmental concerns than small family farms, while only 12 percent disagreed. These findings concur with others regarding perceptions about farm structure, although the real effects of changes in farm structure on agriculture, society, and the environment are far from definitive (Wachenheim and Lesch, Drabenstott). Farmers were more apt than rural nonfarm residents to see the replacement of smaller family farms by large-scale farms as having undesirable consequences and as following from poor economic  conditions (only the latter difference was statistically significant). Rural residents were more apt than city residents to view large-scale farms as creating greater environmental concerns. The difference was not statistically significant. Residents of farm-dependent counties and those that had experienced a population loss more strongly agreed (than nonfarmdependent or population-gain counties) that the displacement of smaller farms will have undesirable economic and social consequences and that poor economic conditions will likely hasten this replacement. Both groups also more strongly agreed that large farms create more environmental concerns, but only the difference between the counties by population loss/gain was significant.  Economic Impact of Farming Seen as Positive North Central respondents overwhelmingly agreed that farmers have a positive impact on their local economy. While 71 percent strongly agreed (table 1), only 5.5 percent disagreed. Over 70 percent believed that most of the agricultural supplies used by farmers are purchased locally, while only 10 percent did not. Three-fourths agreed, most of them strongly, that a loss of farmers in the region would greatly hurt the local economy. Over twothirds agreed that the government should do more to help area farmers stay in business. Regardless of how they were defined, there were no significant differences between groups of respondents on whether the government should do more to help farmers stay in business. Some evidence suggests that perceptions about the economic impact of agriculture should differ  26  by the size of the nearby community (Wachenheim and Lesch). In the current study, perceptions did not, in general, differ between individuals residing near different size towns or cities. One exception was respondents near very small towns (population of the nearest town is less than 250), who were less likely to agree than those near larger towns that most agricultural supplies used by farmers are purchased locally. One explanation is that towns of fewer than 250 inhabitants are generally not large enough to support agricultural input suppliers. The same respondents were more likely than those near larger towns to agree that a loss of farmers in the region would greatly hurt the local economy. Finally, persons residing near towns of more than 2,500 inhabitants were less likely than persons near smaller towns to agree that farmers have a positive impact on the local economy. Residents in a metro adjacent or in a nonrural county more strongly agreed than those in nonmetro or rural counties that most of the agricultural supplies used by area farmers are purchased locally and that the loss of farmers would greatly hurt the local economy. This is contrary to our expectations, but also demonstrates that the perception of farmers as shopping locally is stronger when there is a population base large enough to support local suppliers. As expected, residents of farmdependent counties more strongly agreed than residents of nonfarmdependent counties that farmers have a positive impact on the local economy and that the loss of farmers would greatly hurt the local economy. The same differences in perceptions were evident between  Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   Who Are the Respondents? Characteristics of respondents reflected a rural population. A majority of those surveyed were long-term residents of rural areas. Forty-two percent lived in a city or town, 33 percent in a rural area but not on a farm, and 25 percent on a farm. Among those not currently living on a farm, a slight majority had previously lived on a farm, over two-thirds of them for more than 15 years. Most respondents have had experience with or, because of close proximity, exposure to both crop and livestock farming. Almost 90 percent lived within 5 miles of a farm; 56 percent lived within 1 mile. Among those who lived more than 5 miles from a farm, 48 percent said they had at one time lived within 5 miles of a farm. Of all respondents who do live or have lived within 5 miles of a farm, over three-fourths said the nearest farm raised both livestock and crops. More than half of respondents had either lived on or within 5 miles of a farm for more than 15 years, nearly 80 percent for more than 5 years. About 28 percent of respondents reported owning or operating a farm. Most farms were classified as individual or family farms (94 percent). Over half of those owning or operating a farm said none or less than one-fourth of their net household income came from their farming operation during the past 5 years. Overall, 97 percent of respondents had finished high school or obtained their GED. Fifty-four percent had attended college. A lower percentage of those owning or operating a farm (19 percent) had completed a bachelor's degree than did others (28 percent).

Residents in 63 counties were surveyed. All but three counties are classified as nonmetro (ERS). Of these, 27 are adjacent to a metropolitan county. Counties in the region were first stratified into 12 groups by location relative to a metropolitan center and by population change between 1980 and 1998. Counties were categorized as metropolitan and adjacent or nonmetro and nonadjacent counties. Within each locational category, counties were split into six population categories: population increase from 1980 to 1998 of less than 10 percent, between 10 and 30 percent, and more than 30 percent, and population decrease of less than 5 percent, between 5 and 10 percent, and more than 10 percent.  North Dakota MInnesota Wisconsin South Dakota Michigan Iowa Nebraska Illinois Indiana Kansas Missouri Ohio  Next, 10 households within each of 5 counties in a strata were surveyed by telephone. An equivalent number of households was selected for survey regardless of the population within the county or the State, and responses, as reported, were not weighted. Thus, responses represent only the respondent group and not the general population of the region. Farm perceptions were measured by respondents' level of agreement with statements modified from those originally designed by Buttel and Jackson-Smith (used for a study exploring Wisconsin farmers' views on livestock expansion) and Wachenheim and Lesch (used to explore rural residents' perceptions of corporate and family farms in Illinois). Respondents were asked to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements regarding farming using a fivepoint Likert scale. The 13-item index was designed to represent 5 specific themes: (1) the impact of agriculture on the local economy; (2) farmers' interaction with the environment; (3) the effect of farm structure on the environment, economy, and society; (4) responsibilities of nonfarm residents; and (5) the role of government in assisting farmers, protecting the environment, and restricting the size of livestock farms. The total usable sample was 584. The refusal rate was 55 percent.  28  those residing in counties that had experienced population loss (more strongly agreed) than residents of counties experiencing population gains. Farm residents were more apt to cite the potential loss of farmers in the region as greatly hurting the local economy than were rural nonfarm residents. Ironically, city residents more strongly agreed than farm residents that government should do more to help farmers stay in business. This finding concurs with Leistritz and Ekstrom, who found nonfarm residents more  inclined to support government financial aid for farmers than farmers themselves.  Implications for Rural America This effort contributes to a small but growing body of literature about perceptions of agriculture and its role in the environment, economy, and society. In general, North Central respondents have a favorable view of agriculture. They overwhelmingly agreed that farmers have a positive impact on their local economy. Three-fourths agreed that a loss of farmers in the  region would greatly hurt the local economy; respondents living near small towns were more likely to agree than those living near larger towns or cities. Overall, farmers were considered good environmental stewards, and existing environmental regulations were perceived as appropriate. A majority of respondents agreed that noise, odor, and other environmental issues associated with farming in their area are minimal. Respondents had strong negative opinions about how the consolidating structure of agriculture will  Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   influence the environment, society, and local economies, and a majority agreed the government should do more to help farmers in their area stay in business. The current study concurs with existing literature in finding that an individual's experience with and proximity to agriculture influences their perception. Residents living in or near small towns expressed a greater concern about the effect of fewer farmers in the region. Respondents tied to livestock production were less likely to agree that environmental issues associated with farming exist and that additional environmental legislation is needed. Farm residents expressed greater concern about the impact of farm consolidation, perceived less of an environmental concern associated with agriculture, and more strongly approved of existing legislation regulating agriculture than did nonfarm residents. Residents living in farm-dependent and population-loss counties showed the greatest level of concern about changes in farm structure, and most strongly agreed that farmers contribute to the local economy and that their loss would be felt. Knowing residents' perceptions is important in its own right. These perceptions have been shown to influence the priorities and legislative agendas of governmental agencies (Nordstrom et al.). If these perceptions are inaccurate, individuals, interest groups, and even policymakers may unwittingly work against the competitive forces otherwise defining the role of farms. Inaccurate perceptions can be corrected. A good example of correcting misperceptions by educating nonfarmers about agriculture is reported in Knapp and Griffieon. Presentations and farm tours were used to educate nonfarmers about  agriculture in Polk County, Iowa. To accurately evaluate the need for educational efforts, we must first identify existing gaps between reality and perception. That is, we need to know the facts and the perceptions. Equally important to knowing the perceptions of rural America is recognizing that they cannot be represented as a single viewpoint. Perceptions of individuals with different characteristics and experiences may be unique and perhaps predictable. As demonstrated here, there is likely some correlation between the characteristics defining a group (for example, the size of the nearby town, level of exposure to production agriculture, or farm  or nonfarm residence) and the priorities and values they hold. Values and priorities are often difficult to change. However, the position an individual takes on legislation that will influence the viability of agriculture may be based less on these values and priorities and more on the information that is available to them. If the perceptions of individuals differ by characteristics or experiences that can be used to group them, and if group perceptions differ in part because the knowledge they have differs in level and/or accuracy, then it may be useful for groups promoting particular agricultural policies to target educational campaigns to particular segments of the population.

Larry Leistritz Kenneth A. Root  ural communities across the United States are undergoing dramatic economic restructuring. Many communities in the Upper Midwest have suffered economic turbulence associated with changes in agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. The ""farm crisis"" of the 1980s beset not only farm families but also businesses and public service providers in agricultural trade centers, and recently sluggish prices for major commodities suggest that these problems may recur. The fortunes of some Midwest communities are likewise tied to mining and that industry has undergone both expansion and contraction when market conditions or resource exhaustion dictate. Finally, closure or downsizing of public facilities has led to substantial economic adjustments in some communities.  R  Rural communities across the country are sometimes forced to cope with the closure or downsizing of a major employer. Five communities in Minnesota and North Dakota recently coped with these events. Interviews with community leaders, together with a survey of almost 600 residents, revealed that community adjustments were facilitated by the presence of an active local or regional economic development organization, by substantial lead time prior to the closure or downsizing, and by cohesive local leadership with connections to State and regional organizations.  Past research has found that fallout from facility closure and/or industry downsizing can be quite variable, ranging from mild negative economic effects that result in few community problems to devastating downward spirals of lost employment, dwindling income, population loss, shrinking tax base, and reduced ability of small-town governments to maintain basic services. Because locales differ greatly on economic, demographic, and related factors that influence the extent of impacts and the potential for recovery, it is difficult to generalize common findings from community-level studies. One aim of this article was to identify some of these community-level differences that might determine the success of local economic recovery. Specific objectives were to: Study the approaches that Midwestern communities have used to maintain or restore their economic vitality in the face of plant closings and/or downsizings;  Describe the economic, community, and organizational factors related to the effectiveness of these community development efforts; and Apply that knowledge to assist rural communities in responding to economic restructuring.  Study Communities and Their Closure Experiences The study communities ranged in size from less than 400 residents (Altura, MN) to about 10,000 (Worthington, MN) (table 1). The communities also differed substantially in their proximity to larger cities. Altura and Courtland, MN, in particular, are within a relatively short commuting distance of larger cities (Rochester and Winona for Altura, Mankato and New Ulm for Courtland), whereas Bowman, ND, is about 85 miles from the nearest city with 10,000 or more people and 150 miles from the nearest Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) (fig. 1). Each community had recently experienced the closure or  30  F. Larry Leistritz is a professor in the Department of Agribusiness & Applied Economics, North Dakota State University, Fargo. Kenneth A.

Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   downsizing of a major employer. However, the effects of these events and the communities' responses to them differed substantially.  Altura, Minnesota With a population of just over 350, Altura was the smallest of the five communities we examined. In May 1996, the community lost its dominant employer, a turkey processing plant that employed 222 and had been in existence for over 65 years. Although the plant was later purchased by another firm for use as a processing and freezing facility, by the end of our study (mid-1999) there had been no employees at the facility for more than 2 years. The nature of the facility limited its reuse options, but local impacts were mitigated in that most of the displaced workers were commuters rather than local residents. Workers at the shuttered processing plant reportedly came from 11 Minnesota communities, some as distant as 40 miles, and 3 Wisconsin towns, each about 60 miles away. The closure had an immediate impact on some Altura businesses, as well as on the city budget. Roughly half the business of a Table 1  nearby grocery-grill was from workers at the plant. Since the closure, the store has expanded its catering service and reduced its staff. When the turkey processing plant was operational, it used about 85 percent of the city's water and 90 percent of its waste treatment operating capacity. Consequently, the city is now overbuilt, but the city council has elected not to pass on rate increases to residents, instead running those charges on a deficit out of the city budget. The closure also resulted in a loss of local property tax revenue (roughly $3,000 annually) as a result of the difference between the sale price and previous assessment of the processing plant. Local leadership was initially stymied in developing a plan to respond to the closure, in part because the sale of the plant to a beef processing firm in nearby Rochester, MN, failed to result in any new employment. Lack of available land for either commercial or home development appeared to limit the possibilities of growth. However, 3 years after the closure, the city council has moved to develop a number of new home sites. New residents could poten-  tially commute to jobs in Rochester or Winona, Minnesota, each about 25 miles away.  Bowman, North Dakota Bowman and three other small communities were within 25 miles of the Gascoyne coal mine, which closed in 1995. The 53 displaced workers were locals, but most transferred to jobs at other facilities owned by the Knife River Coal Company. Immediate local impacts were associated with loss of the mine payroll and tax revenue and increased outmigration, rather than substantial unemployment. The outmigration of mine workers and their households exacerbated longterm trends of population decline in the affected communities, and because the miners were well paid, the loss of the mine payroll was significant. Loss of coal severance tax payments represented a substantial revenue reduction for counties, cities, and school districts (totaling about $500,000 annually). The combination of declines in population and local tax revenue have placed added stress on local schools, businesses, and public services. One school has closed since the mine closure, while Bowman area residents have been concerned for several years about the future of their hospital. The impacts of the mine closure were offset somewhat by an expansion of oil and gas activity in the area. Local officials did not perceive dramatic local impacts from the mine closure per se. However, the losses of tax revenue, mine payroll, and workers and families have added to the challenges of maintaining local businesses and public services in the face of steadily declining farm numbers and rural population base.

This allowed the affected area to apply for a Title 9 grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration, which was used to fund a jobs committee. Over its 3-year life, the committee has attempted both to find alternative uses for the mine site and to support other types of economic development in the region, with the aim of replacing the lost jobs. Several of the efforts that have been supported appear to have  promise, but none have created any new jobs yet. The Gascoyne mine closure demonstrates that economic recovery/community development efforts can take a long time to show results. The jobs committee, 3 years into its tenure, had many projects still in the feasibility analysis and/or planning stages and had yet to launch viable local businesses. Because of this, it may be unrealistic to believe that a community response effort can generate new jobs in time to prevent the relocation of displaced workers. Rather, the nurturing of businesses that  may, in time, grow enough to replace the lost jobs and tax revenues may be a community's best hope.  Courtland, Minnesota Courtland, with 458 residents, is 8 miles west of New Ulm in south-central Minnesota. The proximity of Courtland to New Ulm and its labor needs underpins the vitality of the town. Most employed Courtland residents work in New Ulm, and locals acknowledge the ""bedroom community"" feature of their town.  Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   Courtland experienced the closure of a livestock research farm located within Courtland city limits. Most displaced farm workers (30 total) were not Courtland residents and were readily absorbed in the Courtland-New Ulm labor market. The research lab associated with the operation continued to operate, retaining all of its 23 employees. Local residents indicated that the community lost only one family as a result of the closure. Courtland has the great advantage of proximity to a larger city with extensive labor needs. Good roads over a short distance facilitate the commute to New Ulm. While the research farm's closure has not prompted much insight into the problems and pitfalls of downsizing, the community is vacillating over the appropriate level of future growth. Some focus on future planning is mandated by continued population growth in the community, but planning issues could have been stimulated as well by the adjustment to a shutdown. In short, the range of options for Courtland is extensive, but the size of the closure, the strong economy at the time of the downsizing, and the fact that not all displaced workers were Courtland residents made the community adjustment minimal.  Grafton, North Dakota Grafton is a community of about 5,000 located in the northern Red River Valley region of North Dakota and is the county seat of Walsh County. The State Developmental Center was established in Grafton in 1904 and grew to be the town's largest employer, with about 1,040 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions (and nearly 1,200 total personnel) in the late 1980s. Over 1989-95, the center downsized to less than 500 FTE positions, as  more than 80 percent of the clients were moved into group homes and other facilities around the State. Local officials and Developmental Center personnel indicated that many previous employees probably left the area. Others remained, often because of family ties, and commuted to jobs within 1 hour driving time from Grafton. Local leaders added that the immediate impacts of the downsizing were mitigated because many of the center's personnel had been commuting from outside Grafton. Overall, respondents did not recall dramatic impacts from the downsizing. Some separated personnel later rejoined the center staff in another capacity. The reduced demand for housing led to lower values and rents, but the community did not experience widespread vacancies. Main Street businesses felt considerable pressure during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but similar problems plagued virtually every small trade center around North Dakota, as the State's largest urban centers captured increasing shares of retail and service activity. The Grafton area's response to the downsizing took two forms: (1) efforts to establish other uses for the Developmental Center facilities that were being vacated, and (2) more general economic development efforts aimed at establishing ""replacement jobs"" in the area. Local resources were mobilized through the Walsh County Jobs Development Authority (JDA), funded through a countywide property tax levy (3.6 mills), as well as the Grafton Growth Fund, funded from a local option sales tax (1 percent). In addition, the Red River Regional Council has provided technical assistance to the county and community.  These entities have succeeded in both their objectives. They obtained grants, developed a new industrial park, built a speculative building at the park, and attracted a major manufacturing employer to the community. However, local development officials emphasized that several years of effort were required before employment gains were realized. (The JDA was established in 1988 and the Growth Fund in 1990, and the new employer announced its relocation in late 1996.) Efforts to develop alternative uses for the Developmental Center facilities resulted in a plan to rehabilitate two buildings, demolish one, and reserve a fourth for future use. The two rehabbed buildings will be developed for senior housing, one at market rates and the other as affordable housing. The building planned for future use is expected to be an assisted living facility. An important lesson learned from the Grafton experience is that it is possible for a community to recover from a major employment loss. Grafton represents a community in an area characterized by declining employment and population, but nevertheless has replaced the jobs lost in the downsizing. Another lesson from the Grafton experience is that economic recovery/community development efforts can take a considerable time to show results.  Worthington, Minnesota Worthington, Minnesota, is the largest community in southwest Minnesota and, with a population of about 10,000, the largest in our study. In mid-May 1997, the Campbell Soup company anounced that its Worthington chicken processing plant would close on  33  Winter 2002/Volume 16, Issue 4  Rural America   or about August 1, 1997. More than 400 unionized production workers were terminated in the shutdown, along with 35 office personnel. The Campbell Soup closure in Worthington was one of three Campbell operations closed nationwide when the company decided to purchase their meat supply less expensively. About 70 percent of the Campbell Soup employees were Worthington residents; the remaining workers resided in 20 other Minnesota communities and 8 Iowa towns within a 30-mile radius of Worthington. The Campbell workers were generally long-term workers, averaging over 13 years on the job. The average age of the predominantly female workforce was 43, and the average wage was nearly $9 per hour. The termination of 435 Campbell employees represented 4.4 percent of Nobles County 1996 total employment. Still, Campbell Soup was not the dominant meat processing employer in the community. The local pork processing unit of Swift & Co. employs about 1,600. Other substantial employers include the public school system (500 employees), a plastics manufacturer (400), and a mobile home manufacturer (200). A task force was created to study options for the community. The Job Service and the Worthington Chamber of Commerce sponsored a job fair for the soon-to-be displaced Campbell's workers, and the State contributed $600,000 for retraining needs. Because of these measures, and because the pork plant was expanding, the outmigration of dislocated workers was minimal.  34  One of the chief characteristics of the Worthington community response, as identified by local respondents, was the cohesion of community agencies and resources. Turf issues disappeared, and the various groups focused on getting new industry for the Campbell facility that would employ local residents, pay area farmers who had contracted to provide grower facilities for Campbell, and purchase water and power through cityowned utilities. The community created a working partnership with the county, and involved local and State economic development offices. The Worthington experience demonstrates that city leaders need to support displaced workers and that activity needs to be coordinated. Finding replacement jobs through recruiting new industry and retraining terminated workers provides continuity and growth for the community as a whole. A second lesson learned is that turf issues are less important than the total program. Leaders now have experience in coordinating their efforts, and in so doing they are not only ready for the next challenge, but they are also able to see the positive side of any downturn and make it work for community betterment. Responsive leadership has increased city-county economic development, and as a result of marketing, a number of potential employers loom as possible county residents. Further, joint planning on the part of city-county offices means that new efforts are being made to make the community attractive for both new industry and new residents. These efforts include providing natural gas for potential employers and coordination with other communities in establishing an increased water source.  Survey of Study-Community Residents To gain a better understanding of the effects of the closures/downsizings on the study communities, a survey of area residents was conducted. Residents of the study communities were asked what steps had been taken by the employer to ease problems associated with the closure or downsizing. Transferring workers to other employer-owned units was the employer action reported most often (47 percent), followed by providing workers with a significant severance package (31 percent), assisting workers in finding other jobs (26 percent), and assisting local officials in finding new uses or tenants for the closed facility (21 percent). Many respondents (41 to 55 percent for the actions cited) indicated that they did not know whether the specified steps had been taken. The frequency with which employer actions were reported varied substantially by community. More than three-fourths of Altura and Bowman respondents reported that their respective employers had transferred workers, compared with only 22 percent for Courtland. Significant severance packages were reported by 48 percent of respondents in Worthington and 33 percent of those in Bowman, compared with only 17 percent of those in Grafton. Employer assistance in helping displaced workers to find other jobs was reported most often by respondents from Bowman and Worthington, and least often by those from Grafton. On the other hand, Grafton respondents most frequently reported that the employer had assisted local officials in finding new uses/tenants for the facility, while respondents from Altura and Courtland reported this least often. These results are  Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   consistent with information gathered from local officials and representatives of the closed/downsized facilities. Survey respondents were also asked about steps taken by local officials to respond to the closure/ downsizing. About 30 percent overall indicated that local officials helped displaced workers find other work, 23 percent reported that local officials attempted to recruit other employers, and 16 percent indicated that local leaders offered incentives or concessions to the employer to maintain jobs. The share of respondents who reported the different actions again varied  substantially by community. Sixtyone percent of Worthington respondents reported that local officials assisted displaced workers, compared with only 15 percent of Altura respondents. Forty-one percent of respondents from Worthington and 33 percent from Grafton reported that local officials had recruited other employers, compared with 8 percent in Courtland and 9 percent in Altura. (About 40 percent of Grafton residents indicated that their local leaders had lobbied State officials to maintain jobs at the Developmental Center, a State facility.) Respondents who indicated that incen-  tives/concessions had been offered to the employer ranged from 13 percent for Worthington to 3 percent for Altura. As with employer actions, many residents indicated that they did not know whether the local officials had initiated various actions, ranging from 45 percent for assisting displaced workers to 59 percent for incentives/ concessions.  Effects of Closure on Respondent and Family A series of questions explored effects of the closure/downsizing on the respondents or members of their immediate family (husband/ wife, son/daughter, father/mother, sister/brother). Nearly 13 percent of the respondents had worked at the facility that was closed/downsized, ranging from 29 percent of Grafton respondents to 3 percent of those in Bowman (table 2). About 5 percent of the respondents had lost their jobs as a result of the closure/downsizing. Another 18 percent had immediate family members who had worked at the facility, and 10 percent had one or more immediate family members who lost their job as a result of the closure/downsizing. The response to this question varied substantially by community, in part reflecting the dominance of the various employers in their respective communities. For residents who did not work for the closed/downsized facility, almost one-fourth (24 percent) reported that their employer had lost business as a result of the closure/downsizing, ranging from 15 percent in Altura and Courtland to 32 percent in Worthington (table 2). Of this group, 3 percent reported losing their jobs as a result of the other facility's closing/downsizing, while another 6 percent reported that their hours and/or pay were  Procedures The research plan first required selection of nonmetropolitan communities to be studied. The authors developed lists of communities in Minnesota and North Dakota that had experienced the closure or downsizing of a major employer (affecting 25 or more workers) between July 1994 and January 1998. From more than 40 communities initially identified, 5 were selected based on factors such as community size, proximity to other market areas, and the nature of community response to the closure; the aim was to represent small as well as larger towns, and those with highly organized as well as less structured responses. In each of the five case study communities, the authors used common formats in conducting indepth interviews with a cross-section of community leaders, to gain an understanding of the communities (i.e., population characteristics, economic base, etc.), the circumstances of the closure/downsizing that occurred, the effects of the closure/downsizing, and the community's response. These persons were identified based on their elected or appointed governmental positions (e.g., mayor, economic development director) and roles in business, community, and educational organizations. Other community leaders were identified using a snowball technique, whereby individuals interviewed were asked to suggest others who would be knowledgeable concerning the issues discussed. The individuals interviewed (between February and November of 1988) thus included both formal and informal leaders. Subsequently (January-February 1999), a short survey was mailed to a random sample of residents in each of the study communities. The survey focused on the effects of closure on the community and the respondent, responses to the closure, and the respondent's satisfaction with the efforts made by company officials and community leaders. The survey resulted in 571 usable responses, without followup mailings, for a 33-percent completion rate.  35  Winter 2002/Volume 16, Issue 4  Rural America   Table 2  Effects of closure/downsizing on respondents and their families A majority of respondents were not directly affected Community Effect Altura Bowman Courtland Grafton Worthington Overall  Percent Respondent worked for employer that closed/downsized Respondent lost job A member of respondent's immediate family worked for employer that closed/downsized Family member lost job Respondent's employer lost business as a result of closure/downsizing Respondent lost job Respondent's hours and/or pay were reduced Business that respondent owned or managed lost business due to closure/downsizing Respondent's income was reduced Respondent was not directly affected by closure/downsizing Source: Plant closure survey.  5 0 18 12 15 2 6 11 11 65  3 2 8 4 27 1 7 18 18 51  12 8 13 13 15 5 4 16 5 67  29 8 36 10 25 4 5 14 13 60  9 6 13 11 32 5 7 18 18 56  13 5 18 10 24 3 6 16 14 59  reduced. Sixteen percent of the respondents reported that a business that they owned or managed had lost business (revenue) as a result of the closure/downsizing, and 14 percent reported that their income had been reduced. Overall, about 59 percent of the respondents reported that their employment had not been directly affected by the closure/downsizing, ranging from 51 percent for Bowman to 67 percent for Courtland.  Effects of Closure on Community Employment opportunities were the community attribute that the most respondents (75 percent) felt was hurt by the closure/downsizing, followed by local businesses (74 percent) and income of area residents (67 percent). These attributes were the three most often identified by residents of all five study communities (table 3). Other attributes seen as hurt by at least one-third of respondents, overall,  were city government (46 percent), property values (46 percent), schools (43 percent), quality of life (41 percent), and social organizations (40 percent).  Priority Given to Future Closures/Downsizings Community residents were asked what priority should be given, by several groups, to future closures/downsizings. The respondents felt that residents, business people, and city government should  36  Rural America  Volume 16, Issue 4/Winter 2002   give this issue high priority (data not shown). More than 75 percent of respondents from each community felt that community residents should give high priority to future closures/downsizings, while more than two-thirds felt that business people and city government should give this issue high priority. Somewhat lower percentages of the respondents, overall, felt that coun-  ty officials (61 percent), State officials (60 percent), and religious leaders (48 percent) should give high priority to closures/ downsizings.  Satisfaction with Community The respondents were asked to rate satisfaction with their community both before and after the closure/downsizing. Overall, more  than three respondents in four were somewhat or very satisfied with their community before the closure/downsizing (data not shown). Their rating of the community after the closure was 20 percentage points lower (58 percent versus 78 percent were somewhat or very satisfied). Residents' ratings of the community fell after closure in all communities but Courtland.

Case study communities tended to adjust ""better"" when there was/were: An economic development organization (regional, if not local) in place prior to the closure; Cohesion of community and agency leaders who were not concerned with ""turf"" issues; A focus on both assisting displaced workers and economic development; A breadth of contact and networking with State agencies, consultants, and community leaders from other communities that had already weathered a dislocation;  Substantial lead time prior to closure/downsizing; An understanding that the adjustment period from downturn to upturn was not overnight, but might take months or even years; A closure/downsizing that was not the sole or dominant employer; Some displaced workers who were not local residents, but were commuters; A range of alternative reuse options for the closed facility; and Job alternatives available in nearby communities.

However, the widening of the ruralurban gap in the late 1990s seems to halt any trend toward eliminating the rural-urban poverty gap in the near future. income is between half and threequarters of the poverty line, and those with an income greater than 75 percent of the line. While the incidence of poverty is higher in rural areas than in urban areas, the proportion of the poor living in extreme poverty is lower in rural areas. Of the urban poor in 1999, 40.5 percent were extremely poor versus 35.3 percent of the rural poor. Similarly, 38 percent of the rural poor have incomes between 75 and 100 percent of the poverty line, while the rate for the urban poor is only 32.1 percent. The distribution of urban poor persons remained essentially unchanged between 1996 and 1999. This contrasts with the improving income distribution of the rural poor between 1996 and  pproximately 7.4 million persons who live in rural (nonmetro) areas were poor in 1999. The rate of rural poverty for 1999 was 14.2 percent, essentially unchanged from 1998 when 14.3 percent of rural persons were poor. Rural poverty rates were not under 15 percent for two consecutive years at any other time in the 1980s or 1990s. The rural poverty rate for 1999 was the lowest since 1979, and similarly the national and urban poverty rates in 1999 were also at their lowest levels since 1979 (fig. 1). These relatively low levels of poverty coincided with the continuation of the economic boom in the United States. Compared with the small decline in the rural poverty rate, the urban poverty rate declined at a greater pace--from 12.3 percent in 1998 to 11.2 percent in 1999. This widened the gap in rural-urban poverty rates to 3 percentage points from a gap of 2 percentage points in 1998. Throughout the 1980s, the difference in poverty rates between urban and rural areas averaged about 4.4 percentage points, but this average narrowed to 2.6 per-  A  Composition of the Urban and Rural Poor The incidence or rate of poverty measures the percentage of the population who are poor, but this is just one of many ways to measure poverty. There are also poverty indices that provide information on the severity of poverty as well as the incidence. To examine ruralurban differences in the severity of poverty, poor persons can be categorized as those in extreme poverty with an income of less than half the poverty line, those whose Figure 1  Poverty rates by residence, 1980-99 Nonmetro poverty remained under 15 percent in 1999 Percent 20 Nonmetro 15 Metro 10  5 Gap 0 1980 81  82 83  85 86  87 88 89  90 91  92 93 94 95  96 97 98 99  Dean Jolliffe is an economist in the Food Assistance and Rural Economy Branch, Food and Rural Economics Division, ERS.

Any individual with total income less than an amount deemed to be sufficient to purchase basic needs of food, shelter, clothing, and other essential goods and services is classified as poor. The amount of income necessary to purchase these basic needs is the poverty line or threshold and is set by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The 1999 poverty line for an individual under 65 years of age was $8,667, while the poverty line for a twoperson household with one child and one adult was $11,483, and for a household with two adults and three children the poverty line was $19,882. An individual's or household's total income includes cash income (pretax income and cash welfare assistance), but excludes inkind welfare assistance, such as food stamps and Medicare. The poverty line changes over time to correct for inflation, and it is also adjusted to reflect differences in household composition and size. Adjustments for household composition are intended to address the concern that children and adults consume different types and quantities of basic goods and services. Adjustments for household size are intended to address the concern that some basic goods can be shared within a household and therefore the per-person cost of purchasing basic needs declines with each additional person.  1999. In 1996, 33.4 percent of the rural poor had incomes that were between 75 and 100 percent of the poverty line. This proportion increased 4.6 percentage points by 1999. Figure 2 shows that a measure of poverty that is sensitive to the distribution of income of poor persons will present a different picture of the urban-rural poverty gap than when simply looking at the incidence of poverty.  Rural and Urban Poverty by Geographic Region Over 1996-99, the relative poverty ranking of U.S. regions remained unchanged, with the South having the highest rate of rural poverty and the Northeast the lowest (fig. 3). The difference between urban and rural poverty rates also remained quite similar across the regions. In both 1996 and 1999, the largest rural-urban gaps in the poverty rates were in the South. In 1996, the rural-urban difference in the South was 4.7 percentage points. This had increased slightly by 1999 to 5.1 percentage points. The most striking change in regional poverty rates is the improvement in rural and urban poverty rates in the West. The largest decline in the regional poverty rates between 1996 and 1999 (3 percentage points) was in the rural West. In 1996, the rural poverty rate in the West was 18.4 percent, which placed it essentially on par with the South and significantly worse than the Northeast and the Midwest. It then dropped to 15.4 percent in 1999.

The largest decline in percentage terms was for the elderly living in rural areas. As a result of the urban poverty rate for children declining by 3.8 percentage points from 1996 to 1999, the urban-rural gap in poverty rates for children increased from 2.4 to 3.6 percentage points. In 1996, the largest difference in urban-rural poverty rates was for the elderly, but due to the slower improvement for rural children, the largest urban-rural gap in poverty rates in 1999 was for children.

Poverty Rates by Age For all three age categories (under 18 years, 18-64, 65 and over), rural poverty rates were higher than urban rates in both 1996 and 1999. In every case, children had significantly higher rates of poverty than adults and the elderly (fig. 4). The 1999 rural poverty rate for children was 19.8 percent, or 2.7 million children. This poverty rate was 7.4 percentage points greater than the rate for adults and 8.1 percentage points greater than the poverty rate for elderly persons living in rural areas. Between 1996 and 1999, poverty rates declined for all three age categories in both urban and rural areas.

About two-thirds of the food-insecure households avoided hunger, in many cases by relying on a few basic foods and reducing variety in their diets. But 700,000 households (3.4 percent of all nonmetro households) were food insecure to the extent that one or more household members were hungry, at least some time during the year, because they could not afford enough food. Food security is one of several necessary conditions for a population to be healthy and well nourished. Households are food secure when they have assured access at all times to enough food for an active healthy life, with no need for recourse to emergency food sources or other extraordinary coping behaviors to meet their basic food needs. They experience food insecurity when they do not have this assured access to enough food to fully meet basic needs at all times. As food insecurity increases in severity, the quality and variety of meals are reduced and food intake may become irregular. At still more severe levels, insufficient or irregular food intake results in periods of hunger for at least some family members. In households with children, adults usually restrict their own food intake first to provide enough food for the children. Thus, children usually do not go hungry except in households with more severe levels of adult hunger.  he proportion of households that were food insecure--that is, they were not consistently and dependably able to get enough food for an active and healthy life--remained unchanged in nonmetro areas from 1998 to 2000, while declining in metro areas. Single-parent families and racial and ethnic minorities had rates of food insecurity and hunger higher than the national average. During the year ending in September 2000, 88.5 percent of nonmetro households were food secure throughout the entire year (fig. 1). The food-secure households included 79.8 percent that were fully food secure--reporting no problems or concerns in meeting their food needs--and 8.7 percent that reported one or two indications of difficulty in meeting their food needs. The remaining 11.5 percent of nonmetro households, about 2.4 million, were food insecure at some time during the year. That is, they were uncertain of having or were unable to acquire enough food to meet basic needs for all household members because they had insufficient money and  T  Figure 1  Food security, food insecurity, and hunger in nonmetro households, 2000 A large majority of nonmetro households were food secure  Food secure (88.5%)  Food insecure without hunger (8.1%)  Food insecure with hunger (3.4%)  42  Mark Nord (202-694-5433, marknord@ers.usda.gov) is team leader for food stamp and food security research in the Food Assistance and Rural Economy Branch, Food and Rural Economics Division, ERS.

USDA monitors food security, food insecurity, and hunger in the United States through a nationally representative food security survey, conducted annually since 1995 by the U.S. Census Bureau as a supplement to the monthly Current Population Survey. Food insecurity and hunger declined from 1995 to 1999 in both nonmetro and metro areas (fig. 2). The year-to-year deviations from a consistent trend include a substantial 2-year alternation that is believed to result from a seasonal influence on food security prevalence rates. The food security surveys were conducted in April in odd-numbered years and in August or September in even-numbered years. Measured rates of food insecurity were higher in the August/September collections. Even though the questions ask about conditions and behaviors over the past 12 months, respondents remember events that occurred in the near past more clearly than those that occurred almost a year earlier. To assess recent trends without this seasonal bias, comparisons are most appropriately made between 1998 and 2000 rather than from 1999 to 2000. During this 2year period, changes in the rates of food insecurity and hunger in nonmetro areas were small and not statistically significant. In metro areas, the prevalence of food insecurity declined 1.6 percentage points, and the prevalence of hunger declined 0.7 percentage point.  Rates of food insecurity and hunger, by residence, 1995 to 2000 Food insecurity and hunger remained unchanged in nonmetro areas from 1998 to 2000 after declining somewhat from 1996 to 1998 Percent of households 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 1995 Food insecurity nonmetro Food insecurity metro Hunger nonmetro Hunger metro  96  97  98  99  2000  Note: Data were adjusted so that prevalence rates are strictly comparable for all years.

The adjustments result in somewhat lower prevalence estimates than those presented in figure 1 and tables 1-3, which are based on unadjusted data.

Food Insecurity Rates Higher in Nonmetro Areas In 2000, the rate of food insecurity was higher in nonmetro than in metro areas (table 1). To be classified as food insecure, a household must report at least three indicators of food insecurity, most commonly that (1) they worried that their food would run out before they got money to buy more, (2) the food they bought did not last and they did not have money to get more, and (3) they could not afford to eat balanced meals. More serious indicators, including indicators of disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake, were also reported by many food insecure households. Food insecurity was more prevalent in nonmetro than in metro areas in all four geographical regions and for almost all types of households  analyzed. Not all of the nonmetrometro differences were statistically significant, but only two categories--Hispanics and elderly-- registered rates lower in nonmetro than in metro areas.  Nonmetro West, Minorities, and Single-Parent Families Were Most Food Insecure Regionally, food insecurity rates were highest in the nonmetro West and South and lowest in the Midwest. Food insecurity was almost three times as prevalent among nonmetro Blacks as among nonmetro Whites, and for nonmetro Hispanics the rate was over twice that of nonmetro Whites. These differences reflect the higher poverty rates of racial and ethnic minorities. For Blacks and Whites, food insecurity was more prevalent  43  Winter 2002/Volume 16, Issue 4  Rural America   Table 1  Households with food insecurity, 1998 and 2000 Food insecurity was higher in nonmetro than in metro households, and most prevalent in single-parent families with children and among racial and ethnic minorities Category Nonmetro 1998 Nonmetro 2000 Metro 2000 U.S. total 2000  Percent (households) All households Census region: Northeast Midwest South West Race and ethnicity (of household head): White non-Hispanic Black Hispanic Household structure: Two-parent families with children Single-parent families with children1 Multiple-adult households--no children1 Single men living alone Single women living alone Age: All ages 0-17 18-64 65 and over 11.8 9.7 8.3 14.1 14.4 9.6 27.9 21.2 12.8 34.0 5.8 12.8 9.8 11.5* 10.3* 8.9 12.5 15.5* 9.6* 25.8* 21.1 13.1* 31.5* 6.1 9.8 10.6 10.2* 8.6* 8.6 11.6 11.2* 7.0* 19.8* 21.4 10.3* 27.8* 5.5 8.8 10.0 10.5 8.8 8.7 11.8 11.7 7.6 20.5 21.4 10.9 28.5 5.6 9.0 10.1  Percent (persons)2 13.7 20.4 12.8 5.0 13.4* 20.5* 12.4* 4.6 11.9* 17.4* 10.7* 5.3 12.1 18.0 11.0 5.2  *Difference between nonmetro and metro prevalence rate is statistically significant at 90-percent confidence level. 1Statistics for single-parent families with children and multiple-adult households with no children in 1998 are revised from those published in Rural Conditions and Trends, Vol. 11, No. 2, 2000.

One out of five nonmetro children lived in food insecure households, reflecting the greater economic difficulties faced by many rural families with children. Food insecurity was much higher in single-parent families with children than in any other household type. This was especially true in nonmetro areas, where almost one in  three single-parent families (31.5 percent) was food insecure sometime during the year ending in September 2000. The incidence of food insecurity was also higher in two-parent families with children than in households with no children, although less than half that of single-parent families. The lowest rates of food insecurity were in multiple-adult households with no children present (6.1 percent) and for single men living alone (9.8 percent).  In 2000, 13.4 percent of the nonmetro population lived in food insecure households. This proportion was slightly higher than the proportion of households because larger families are more likely to be food insecure than are smaller families and persons living alone. The elderly were less than half as likely as working-age adults to live in food-insecure households.

In the age breakdown, the numbers represent the percentage of persons in each age category living in households that registered hunger. 3Children usually do not experience hunger except in households in which adults experience more severe and prolonged hunger (see table 3).

Hunger Due to Lack of Money Reported in 3.4 Percent of Nonmetro Households In about one-third of food insecure nonmetro households--those in which food shortages were more serious or prolonged--food intake  was curtailed at times to the extent that one or more household members were hungry. These households reported experiences and behaviors associated with more severe levels of food insecurity. Adults reported eating less than they felt they should and cutting and skipping meals repeatedly due to lack of money for food. Households with children reported inability to feed the children bal-  anced meals and reliance on only a few kinds of low-cost food for the children. One or more household members, mainly adults, in 3.4 percent of nonmetro households (0.7 million households) experienced such hunger during the year prior to the survey; this proportion was not significantly different in metro areas (table 2).

In both nonmetro and metro areas, 8 percent of single-parent families had episodes of hunger during the year.  Poverty-Related Hunger Rare Among Rural Children Although 4.2 percent of nonmetro children lived in households classified as food insecure with hunger (table 2), the children themselves in most of these households were not hungry. In most U.S. households, children--especially younger children--are protected from reductions in food intake unless the level of adults' depriva-  tion is quite severe. Only about 0.5 percent of nonmetro households had levels of food insecurity so severe that children were also hungry at times (table 3). Rates of hunger among children did not differ significantly between nonmetro and metro areas. Households classified as having hunger among children responded ""yes"" to at least five of the eight questions in the food security survey that asked specifically about children's experiences of food stress. These households typically reported all of the following: they relied on a few kinds of low-cost food to feed the children because  they were running out of money to buy food; they couldn't afford to feed the children balanced meals; the children were not eating enough because the family could not afford enough food; they cut the size of the children's meals because there was not enough money for food; and the children were hungry, but the family could not afford more food. Children's hunger was more than twice as prevalent in singleparent families as in two-parent families. Rates of hunger among children were higher among Blacks and Hispanics than among nonHispanic Whites.

Ghelfi  Earnings Per Nonfarm Job Real earnings per nonfarm job increased during 1998-99, by 1.3 percent in nonmetro areas and 2.5 percent in metro areas (table 2). This is down from the 2.7- and 3.5percent growth nonmetro and metro areas experienced in 199798, but is still a better-than-average year for both areas. Since the last recession ended in 1991, real earnings per job have grown at annual average rates of 0.8 and 1.5 percent in nonmetro and metro areas. The earnings of nonmetro jobs in all industries, except transportation and public utilities, more than kept up with inflation during 199899. The fastest earnings growth in nonmetro areas was among agricultural services, forestry, and fishing jobs, followed by jobs in the Federal military and construction. In metro areas, jobs in mining had the fastest earnings growth (despite loss in jobs), followed by wholesale trade and the agricultural services, forestry, and fishing group. In all regions, real earnings per job increased in both metro and nonmetro areas, with metro growth outpacing nonmetro growth (fig. 2). Among nonmetro regions, earnings growth was highest in the Plains and Rocky Mountain regions (1.6 percent) followed by New England. Among metro regions, earnings growth was highest in the Far West (3.9 percent) followed by the New England and Rocky Mountain regions.  Trends in Earnings Per Nonfarm Job, 1969-99 Nonmetro earnings have not kept pace with metro earnings since 1979 (fig. 3 and table 3). The ratio of nonmetro to metro earnings increased during 1969-79, reaching a peak of 80.8 percent in 1979. That ratio fell consistently to 68.7 percent in 1999, with only a slight upward blip in 1993-94. The gap between metro and nonmetro earnings per job reached $11,483 in 1999, the widest gap over the 31year period.  etween 1998 and 1999, nonfarm jobs increased at a slower rate in nonmetro (1.5 percent) than in metro areas (2.4 percent) (table 1). Both areas had averaged 2.1 percent annual job growth in the 8 years (1991-99) since the 1990-91 recession. Compared with those rates, nonmetro job growth slowed in 1999 while metro growth picked up. During 1998-99, mining and manufacturing lost jobs in both nonmetro and metro areas, with slightly larger declines in metro areas (fig. 1). Wholesale trade grew in metro areas, while nonmetro areas lost a small number of such jobs. In all other major industries, the number of jobs increased in both metro and nonmetro areas, with nonmetro growth usually less. Nonmetro job growth in 199899 was slowest in the Southwest, while metro job growth was slowest in the Great Lakes (table 1). Metro areas in the Rocky Mountain region led all other regions in job growth (3.2 percent). Nonmetro New England led all nonmetro regions (2.3 percent).  B  County-Level Jobs and Earnings Not every nonmetro county experienced job growth during 1998-99. Counties losing jobs numbered 718, or some 31 percent of all nonmetro counties (fig. 4). Jobgrowth counties are divided into three groups (about 520 counties each). Job growth in the top two groups more than compensates for the loss and slow-growth groups, resulting in the overall 1.5-percent job growth for nonmetro areas as a whole. Figure 5 shows nonmetro counties by quartiles of earnings per nonfarm job. The lowest quartile, about 570 counties with earnings per job of less than $20,669, is concentrated in the center of the country.

Cook in the rural Northeast). Factors such as differences in population size, numbers and concentrations of eligible populations, and the predominance of various programs help shape the regional variations. The rural-urban gap in per capita transfer payments, however, fails to capture the relative economic importance of transfer payments to overall well-being. In 1999, transfer payments represented about 18 percent of total rural personal income, compared with 11 percent of urban personal income. The degree of reliance on transfer payments--both rural and urban --remained steady between 1994 and 1999 (fig. 2). As in the past, retirement and disability payments (primarily Social Security benefits) and medical benefits (primarily Medicare and Medicaid) accounted for the bulk--over 80 percent--of transfer income in 1999. Income maintenance programs such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and food stamps represented an additional 10 percent. The remainder consisted of a variety of other small-scale programs (table 1). Rural per capita benefits exceeded urban benefits in all program categories except family assistance (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families)--$38 in rural areas versus $72 in urban areas in 1999. This may reflect State differences in benefit levels or differing levels of participation between rural and urban residents. The passage of welfare reform legislation in 1996 under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) prompted State variations in the creation, tailoring, and operation of welfare programs. State programs now reflect considerable differences in eligibility criteria, work requirements, and referrals to alternative forms of assistance. The extent to which factors such as differences in State programs, voluntary and involuntary withdrawals from assistance programs, the decisions of eligible family heads to initially participate in family assistance programs, and differences in per capita benefit levels affect rural-urban differentials in participation is not fully understood.  ederal, State, and local governments transferred about $1 trillion to individuals, organizations, businesses, and administrative and service costs in 1999. Total transfer income may be slightly lower than amounts reported in the past because of definitional changes by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (see ""About the Data""). Of the $924.4 billion distributed directly to individuals in 1999, rural (nonmetro) areas received $207.4 billion or $3,828 per capita. Urban (metro) areas received $756.8 billion or $3,462 per capita (table 1). In keeping with past trends, per capita transfer payments in rural areas were higher overall than in urban areas, but levels varied by region (fig. 1). Per capita payments were highest in the urban Northeast ($4,510). Only in the Northeast did urban transfer payments exceed the rural amount. In other regions, the urban per capita payments lagged rural payments by at least $300, with the largest differential occurring in the South. Per capita transfers were approximately $4,000 in the rural South (as well as  F  Overall Transfer Payments Fluctuate With Earnings Between 1994 and 1999, per capita transfer payments grew 1.8 percent per year in rural areas and 1.0 percent in urban areas. Growth in rural per capita earnings increased by 2.0 percent per year, while urban per capita earnings increased 3.2 percent. Transfer income generally rises and falls inversely with increases and decreases in earnings. During 199497 when per capita earnings growth was relatively weak (slightly over 1 percent in rural areas and over 2 percent in urban areas), transfer payments were growing between 1.5 and 2.5 percent per year. Between 1997 and 1999, when per capita earnings growth quickened, growth in transfer pay-  56  Peggy J.

The higher rates of growth in ""other maintenance programs"" observed in both rural and urban areas were likely driven by an Figure 2  increase in earned income tax credits, a major component of the category. Per capita benefits for two programs--family assistance and food stamps--exhibited sharp declines during 1994-99 (rural and urban alike). These declines in benefits are in keeping with declines in program participation levels since welfare reform, although declining participation in the food stamp program was not necessarily anticipated. The patterns, however, differed for rural and urban areas. In rural areas, per capita benefits for family assistance and food stamps declined during 1997-99 at slower rates than those in 1994-97, although per capita benefits for family assistance slowed more rapidly than food stamp benefits (table 1). In urban areas, however, rates of decline in family assistance benefits during 1997-99 slowed markedly from 1994-97 rates, but the rate of decline in food stamp benefits  Rates of Change Vary by Program In comparison to overall transfer payments, the patterns of growth (or decline) varied considerably by the major program categories. During 1994-99, per capita benefits for retirement/disability programs grew more slowly while per capita medical benefits grew faster than overall transfer payments in both rural and urban areas. A decline in Medicare benefits during 1997-99 in both rural and urban areas, however, could signal a reversal to the long-term trend of rising per capita medical payments. Per capita payments for income maintenance increased marginally in rural areas and declined in urban areas from 1994 to 1999. Furthermore, rates of change varied sharply among the different programs comprising the category.

In urban areas, the decline in per capita benefits was highest in the West (14.7 percent). Benefits in other urban regions declined over 10 percent (fig. 4). While the differences in ruralurban patterns are not fully understood, contributing factors--especially involving the food stamp program--include the concentrations of immigrant populations in urban areas, State demographic differences, and program changes affecting different client groups.

Recipients of transfer payments do not perform work in exchange for benefits, although they may have performed work earlier to be eligible for benefits. For example, retired people receive Social Security because they worked earlier in their lives and paid taxes to fund the program. Government transfers to individuals are reported for the following categories: retirement and disability programs (mainly Social Security), medical programs (Medicare, Medicaid, military insurance programs), income maintenance programs (Supplemental Security Income for poor elderly, disabled, and blind; family assistance; food stamps; and other income maintenance such as earned income tax credits), unemployment insurance, veterans' programs, and other. The transfer data series currently encompasses 1969 to 1999. BEA annually releases another year of estimates, including revisions made for the two years prior. Periodically, BEA recalculates all data for all years to match adjustments it made to accounting rules used in producing national income and product accounts. In 1998, payments to retirees from Federal, military, and State and local government retirement programs were no longer treated as transfers. Before this adjustment, the retirement and disability category accounted for about 50 percent of nonmetro transfer payments to individuals (as of 1997). After the adjustment, the category accounted for about 44 percent of nonmetro transfer payments to individuals (as of 1999).

W. Beck, Inc. in association with Iowa State University. The main report provides additional detail beyond that found in this Executive Summary and thoroughly documents the methodology used in producing the study results. The REI Study methodology confor ms to the methodology for gathering economic data on the recycling and reuse industry that was developed by the Northeast Recycling Council and that has been used in many other state and national REI studies.1 Recycling establishments that use a combination of recycled and virgin feedstock in making their products wer e defined to be recycling and reuse industry establishments for the purposes of this project.2 Economic statistics wer e gather ed for each of twenty-six categories of r ecycling and reuse establishments that were consider ed to be dir ectly in the recycling and reuse industry. The direct economic values that were measured by this study included: Number of establishments; Employment; Annual payroll; Annual receipts; and Annual recover ed materia l throughput (for recycling categories). The study also estimated the broa der effect of recycling and reuse indu and personal spending by their employees on the Illinois economy in economic activity supported in other industries. This infor mation was economic modeling and included an analysis of state tax revenues recycling and reuse industry. stry establishments ter ms of jobs and developed through attributable to the  Finally, the study projected the economic effects of three industry growth scenarios. The analyses included an estimate of the requir ed investment in recycling associated with each of the scenarios. The three scenarios wer e: Achieving a 35 percent state recycling rate; Achieving a 50 percent state recycling rate; and Banning the disposal of electronics in Illinois landfills.  SIZE OF THE RECYCLING AND REUSE INDUSTRY Illinois' recycling and reuse industry is highly diverse in ter ms of which recovered materials are utilized, average establishment size, and which technologies are employed. Its recycling sector includes long-established sub-industries, such as paper and steel making, as well as new entrepr eneurial ventures, such as composting and recycled rubber product ma nufacturing. The reuse and rema nufacturing sector encompasses a diverse mix of 1 2  Northea st Recycling C ouncil, Recycling Economic Information Study, June 2000.

Beck, Inc.   E  XECUTIVE SUMMARY  Insight into Illinois' recycling and reuse industry can be obtained by comparing the relative sizes of individual business categories and groups of categories that are related in ter ms of materials recycled or sector of the industry that they are in. Sector groupings include: Recycling Collection; Processing; Manufacturing; and Reuse and Rema nufacturing.  COMPAR  ISON OF INDUSTRY SECTOR SIZES  Figur es ES-1 and ES-2 compare the relative sizes of the recycling collection, recycling processing, recycling ma nufacturing, and reuse/r ema nufacturing sectors of the industry. As illustrated, the economic size of the r ecycling ma nufacturing sector far exceeds the size of the recycling collection, recycling processing, and reuse sectors.

Sales revenues, in turn, are used to employ persons and pay their wages, make payments on equipment, provide a return to owners and investors, and pay upstream supplier establishments for the value of their goods or services. The cost in ter ms of labor, equipment, etc. of perfor ming a particular process is a measure of the value that is added by that particular process. The progression in size from r ecycling collection to recycling processing to recycling ma nufacturing follows from the fact that those sectors are part of a chain wher e incr easingly mor e value is added to the recovered material as it moves through the recycling chain. Initially, a relatively small amount of va lue is added by consolidation (collection). Processors invest significa ntly mor e expense (value) in the recovered material by sorting and densification. However, no transformation of the recover ed material has yet occurred  the material has simply been concentrated. The gr eatest value is added in manufacturing, wher e relatively useless raw materials of little value are made into useful products of considerable value. Reuse and rema nufacturing differ slightly in that they focus on consolidation and refurbishing of products (not raw materials) that still ha ve significant value; however, the value reuse adds cannot exceed the value inher ent in a new product made from raw materials  other wise people would buy the new product. This limits the a mount of value that can be added, and thus the size of the r euse sector compared to the ma nufacturing sector. Although the r euse and rema nufacturing sector comprises 39 percent of total establishments, it ma kes up only 13 percent of total employees, 7 percent of payroll, and 5 percent of receipts.4 4  These r eu se and r ema nufa cturing figures are thou ght to r epr esent the minimum amount of economic a ctivity captured by the methodology becau se r emanu facturing a ctivities ar e often included with traditional manu fa cturing industries that wer e not inclu ded in this stu dy. Several year s a go Boston Univer sity estimated rema nu facturing activities on the national level ( Pr ofessor Robert T. Lund, The Remanufacturing Industry: Hidden Giant, 1996).

These local collection and establishments include the following categories of establishments:  Government staffed residentia l curbside collection; Privately-staffed residential curbside collection; Compost and miscellaneous organics products producers; Materials recover y facilities; and Recyclable material wholesalers. Alternatively, establishments in the recycling manufacturing sector are consider ed to be downstrea m consumers of recover ed materials who rely on local collectors and processors for their supply of materials. When the two gr oups are compar ed, local collection and processing ma ke up 19 percent of total recycling employment, 17 percent of recycling payroll, and 28 percent of r eceipts, wher eas downstrea m manufacturing ma kes up the rema ining 81 percent of employment, 83 percent of payroll, and 72 percent of receipts. This suggests that significa nt downstrea m private recycling economic activity is supported by: (1) public policies that encourage recycling and discourage disposal; and (2) public and private investment in local recyclables collection and processing infrastructure.  LARGEST CONTR  IBUTORS  Upon closer examination, over half of the economic activity for the entire recycling and reuse industry is accounted for by the following four categories of establishments: Plastics converters, which employ 12,195 people and gross $1.9 billion in annual receipts; Steel mills, which employ 9,199 people and gross $2.9 billion in annual receipts; Recyclable material wholesalers, which employ 6,104 people and gross $3.0 billion in annual receipts; and Iron and steel foundries, which employ 5,789 employees and gross $0.8 billion in annual receipts. These four categories alone account for 59 percent of all employees, 64 percent of wages, and 71 percent of total receipts. Figures ES-3 and ES-4 place this infor mation into further perspective by showing how the size of Illinois' ma jor recyclable materials manufacturing industries compare to each other. As the figures show, the metals and plastics recycling ma nufacturing industries contribute predominantly to recycling manufacturing's overall size.  R. W. Beck, Inc.

When large quantities of a high-va lue commodity are returned to the stream of commer ce, the large amount of intrinsic value r eturned to the economy can support mor e jobs and economic activity than if a lesser amount or lower value commodity is returned to the strea m of commerce. Plastics and non-ferrous metals are at the top of the value scale, ferrous metals and paper are in the middle, and glass and compost are at the low end of the value scale. Major material group recycling a mounts as estimated by this study are: Yard waste  335 thousand tons (recycling of other organic materials is negligible); ES-8 R. W. Beck, Inc.   E Glass  151 thousand tons; Nonferrous metals  424 thousand tons; Plastics  378 thousand tons; Paper  902 thousand tons; and Ferrous metals  4,262 thousand tons.  XECUTIVE SUMMARY  When both the a mount recycled and value are considered together, the relative sizes of the various material groups can be explained. Similarly, estimates can be ma de of the economic impact that results from incr eased diversion of the various materials.  THE RE  CYCLING AND REUSE INDUSTRY IN PERSPECTIVE  Figur es ES-5, ES-6, and ES-7 show how Illinois' r ecycling and reuse industry compares to other select state industries.5 These industries wer e chosen because they present alternatives to recycling and reuse (i. e., waste ma nagement and mining) or because they are consider ed to be important or preferred industries that are often targeted by economic developers.

As Table ES-4 shows, the gr eatest impacts of industry gr owth are seen in recycling collection and processing, rather than in recycling manufacturing. This result reflects the fact that recycling ma nufacturing is undertaken not as a recycling service, but in order to produce ES-12 R. W. Beck, Inc.   E goods using mor e grow.

As Table ES-5 shows, the gr eatest costs are incurred by local gover nments and/or the commercial sector in achieving the recycling results of each scenario. Tax revenues, alternatively, are nearly equally split between the state and local governments. Although not quantified, it should be noted that the federal gover nment also benefits from incr eased tax revenues resulting from economic growth. In addition to the costs and benefits listed in Table ES-5, ther e are other benefits to recycling that have not been quantified in this study, including: Disposal tip fee cost savings; Job creation; Extending landfill life; Energy savings; Greenhouse gas reduction; Atmospheric and waterbor ne emissions reductions; and Resource conservation.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  ES- 13   E  XECUTIVE SUMMARY  The State of Illinois must consider the relative importance of these additional benefits, compared to those that wer e quantified, as it steers the course into the future of waste reduction and recycling in Illinois.  CONCLUSIONS The recycling and reuse industry contributes significantly to the Illinois economy, providing large numbers of good jobs that pay well, as shown by the following statistics: The average wage paid by the recycling and reuse industry is $32,900  about $400 mor e per year than the average Illinois wage. 6 The recycling and reuse industry supports 2.2 percent of the paid jobs in Illinois  0.9 percent through dir ect employment, and 1.3 percent by industry and employee spending in the economy.6 Some 1.9 percent of the Illinois gross state product is attributable to the r ecycling and reuse industry, with 0.7 percent provided dir ectly by the industry. 7 Recycling manufacturing establishments are critical to the strength of Illinois' current recycling and reuse industry and overall state economy. This industrial sector has a dema nd for mor e recover ed materials than are recovered in the state  thus materials must be imported from other states and countries. Many of the inter mediate products of recycling ma nufacturing establishments support other manufacturing jobs in the state or result in the flow of profits into the state from the sale of those products outside Illinois' borders. Illinois' economy significantly benefits from this industrial sector in ter ms of the jobs it provides, support it gives to the state's manufacturing base and other economic sectors, and tax revenues that flow to the state. By implementing programs and policies to achieve higher recycling rates, Illinois can expand its economy and provide a dditiona l jobs for its citizens. It is projected that many of these jobs will be in the recycling collection and recycling processing sectors of the industry, although ther e will also be increases in the recycling manufacturing and reuse/rema nufacturing sectors as well as the broader state economy. For example, it is estimated that implementing programs and policies to achieve a 50 percent recycling rate in the state will result in an additional 12,600 jobs in the recycling and reuse industry itself, and an additional 14,000 jobs in the broa der Illinois economy. As noted previously, investments at the local level in collection and processing of recyclables and public policies that favor recycling and reuse certainly support large private sector investments in downstrea m processing and manufacturing. However, further study is necessary to assess specific opportunities and conditions for expanding recycling ma nufacturing in Illinois.  6  Average wage a nd total jobs data come from the U.S. Bur eau of Economic Analysis, r egional a ccou nts data, regional economic pr ofile for the U.S. for 1997 wage a nd salary jobs.

The goal of the study was to document the size of the recycling and reuse industry by first deter mining dir ect economic infor mation for each of twenty-six categories of recycling and reuse establishments. The dir ect economic values that wer e measured included: Number of establishments; Employment; Annual payroll; Annual receipts; and Annual throughput (for applicable categories). Next, similar information was estimated for four categories of supporting establishments intimately involved in the recycling and reuse industry. Finally, the broader effect of recycling and reuse businesses and their employees on the economy was derived through economic modeling using direct data as inputs. This infor mation included: Indirect economic va lues (inter-industry linkages as measured by purchase of inter mediate commodities); Induced economic values (personal spending by employees of dir ect and indir ect establishments); Multipliers to calculate total economic values (the sum of dir ect, indir ect, and induced) from dir ect economic values; and Tax revenues attributable to the recycling and reuse industry. Finally, the study projected the economic effects of three industry growth scenarios. The analyses included an estimate of the requir ed investment in recycling associated with each of the scenarios. The three scenarios wer e: Achieving a 35 percent state recycling rate; Achieving a 50 percent state recycling rate; and Banning the disposal of electronics in Illinois landfills.  1.2 COMPARISON TO SIMILAR STUDIES This REI and reuse has been contained study confor ms to the methodology for gathering economic data on the recycling industries that was developed by the Northeast Recycling Council (NERC) and that used in many other state and national REI studies. As a result, the infor mation in this report is generally comparable to that of REI studies conducted for:  R. W.

Although those existing studies quantified employment and most included other industry size estimates (such as annual sales or value-added), they used varying (and sometimes inconsistent) data collection methodologies and industry definitions. Ther efor e, care should be taken if attempting to compare the results of this study to previous studies. Table 1-1 lists the types of data collected in this study compared to thr ee previous economic infor mation studies.

W. Beck, Inc.  1-3   ECTION 2 DATA CHARACTERIZATION  S  2.1 STUDY BOUNDARIES Defining the recycling and reuse industry is complex. For exa mple, one establishment ma y perfor m a variety of processing and/or manufacturing activities, only some of which are related to recycling or reuse. So the question arises whether the establishment should be included, and if so, what portion of that establishment's activities should be attributed to recycling/r euse. In the case of product ma nufacturing, both recycled and non-r ecycled materials may be used, again raising the question whether the total activity should be included or only a partial amount. The most challenging issue that recycling economic infor mation studies face is defining the extent of economic infor mation to include when an industry is able to utilize recover ed as well as virgin feedstock or makes an inter mediate product as well as converts those inter mediate products to end-products within the same facility. Consistent with the methodology developed by NERC on behalf of the EPA, this study includes those activities that are most essential to the continued recycling of materials and reuse of used products. The study boundaries: Include all ""supply side"" activities involved in recover ing and preparing materials and used products for resale; Include ""dema nd side"" activities up to the first point at which the recover ed materials or used products have successfully competed dir ectly against their respective primary, or virgin, equivalents; Exclude the activities of non-business entities such as individuals, and of advocacy, education and other organizations which do not directly add value to recovered materials and used products, or dir ectly support such activities; and, Exclude activities involving incineration or use of materials as fuel. ""Recycling and Reuse"" as defined in this study includes the following ""cover ed activities"": Collecting materials or used products for the purposes of inter mediate processing, ma nufacturing, and/or distribution by reuse sales establishments; Inter mediate processing of recover ed materials or used products including sorting, clea ning, consolidating, treating, disassembling, densifying, and/or transferring ownership for use in processing, product manufacturing, and/or for distribution by reuse sales establishments; Reclaiming of recover ed materia ls or used products to produce refined raw materials and/or reusable products meeting the specifications of ma nufacturers, reuse sales establishments or other end-users; Manufacturing ""first-stage"" products containing recycled materials or used products; Operating wholesale or retail sales establishments that offer, largely or exclusively, used products prepared for reuse; and Intimately supporting the above activities through research, equipment development and sales, consulting, engineering, brokering, and excha nge ser vices. The end-point of recycling is consider ed to be the ""first-stage"" manufactured product. ""Firststage"" r efers to the first product produced from r ecycled materials, such as a roll of paper, R. W. Beck, Inc. 2-1   S  ECTION  2  sheet of plastic, glass bottle or metal billet. First-stage products are often converted into finished products (e.g., envelopes, plastic bottles, or metal parts), sometimes at the same facility. Only production of first-stage products is intended to be included in this definition. At this stage, the recycled material has successfully competed against virgin materia l and is often indistinguishable fr om other first-stage products that are made from those virgin materials. This study attempted to exclude economic activity associated with further conversion within the same facility as these are essentially ma nufacturing rather than recycling activities.  2.2 BUSINESS CATEGORIES This report presents recycling and reuse industry data for twenty-six separate business categories. Data is also presented for four categories of support businesses because of their intimate involvement in the industry. The business categories are grouped into thr ee major sectors: Recycling Industry: includes all collection and processing of recover ed materials and ma nufacturing using recycled materials; Reuse and Re manufacturing Industry: includes preparation of materials for reuse and remanufacturing of used or broken equipment; and Support Businesses: businesses that do not dir ectly recycle materials or reuse products, but provide specialized equipment and services necessary to the recycling and reuse industry.

In deriving the direct infor mation, five primary data types wer e developed: Number of Establishments: An establishment is a single physical location wher e business is conducted or wher e services or industrial operations are perfor med; Employment: Consists of full and part-time employees, including salaried officers and executives of corporations; Total Annual Payroll: Includes all for ms of compensation, such as salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation allowa nces, sick-leave pay, and the value of payments in kind (e.g., free meals and lodgings) paid during the year to all employees; Total Annual Receipts: Revenue for goods produced, distributed, or services provided, including revenue earned from premiums, commissions and fees, rents, interest, dividends, and royalties. Excludes all revenue collected for local, state, and federal taxes; and Total Throughput: Total tons of recover ed materials collected or processed. This data type was not gather ed for reuse and support business categories because reuse businesses typically do not track throughput data in a manner comparable to recycling businesses (e. g., they ma y use the number of units remanufactured rather than tons). The total economic infor mation, developed through economic modeling, generated four secondary data types: Indirect Economic Values: Economic activity accrued by other establishments (suppliers and customers) as a result of the activities of the r ecycling and reuse businesses; Induced Economic Values: Economic activity accrued by retail and other establishments because of personal purchases by recycling a nd reuse industry and indir ect establishment employees; Multipliers: The ratio of total values (dir ect, indir ect, and induced) to direct values; and Tax Revenues: State revenues derived from taxes, charges and fees, and miscellaneous revenues.  2-4  R.

This section includes general descriptions of strategies for data gathering and analysis employed in the study. Notes on the specific methodology for the dir ect data for each category are shown in Section 4 along with the results of the study.  3.2 APPROACHES TO DIRECT DATA DEVELOPMENT In developing the direct economic infor mation reported in Section 4, one of thr ee methods was employed for each business category, depending on the availability and adequacy of existing infor mation and business lists: Existing Data: Obtained through existing sources of infor mation (e. g., U.S. Census Bureau's Economic Census, U.S. Geological Survey's Mineral Commodity Reports, expert opinions by industry and trade associations); Survey Data: Gathered by surveying the businesses dir ectly and compiling the data into a database of establishments; or Derivation: Limited existing data was used to derive estimates of economic activity. The study focused on using existing data, of sufficient quality, and with categories defined consistently with the study, for as many business categor ies as possible to avoid duplicating efforts if sources of existing infor mation wer e available. If little or no existing infor mation was available but listings of businesses in a category wer e available, the next option was to develop a database of businesses and conduct surveys to obtain the desir ed economic infor mation. When limited existing infor mation was available, but no specific list of establishments could be found for purposes of surveying, estimates wer e derived based on limited existing data and estimations by industry experts. Due to the number of differ ent business categories included in this study, the exact methodology used to calculate economic activity for each categor y was tailor ed to fit the material flows and processes found in each. Table 3-1 lists the business categories and the approach used for each category.  R. W.

Each of the three approaches is described in greater detail in the following subsections. Further mor e, Appendix B summarizes data sources used for compiling the survey database or otherwise used for producing direct data for this study. After the dir ect economic values wer e developed, total economic values wer e estimated through economic modeling, using the direct data as inputs. In order to apply the economic 3-2 R. W. Beck, Inc.   M  ETHODOLOGY  model accurately, certain categories required additional infor mation, known as inter mediate inputs. To derive the total economic values, the following steps wer e taken: Survey for Inter mediate Inputs  A establishments was conducted to obtain inputs such as raw materials, chemicals, necessary for production (usually express particular type of industry); and detailed survey of a limited number of estimates of the a mounts of expenditur es on electricity, accounting services and other items ed as a dollar amount per $1,000 in output for a  Conduct Economic Modeling  A process based on an input-output approach developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Several models have been developed, including RIMS II, IMPLAN, and REMI. The model chosen for this study was the IMPLAN.  3.2.1 E  XISTING DATA  The first strategy employed was to utilize existing data from public sources or trade associations. The most common exa mple of this strategy was the use of U.S. Census Bureau reports when a category defined in the study aligned well with a distinct census category. Reports from the U.S. Census included the 1997 Economic Census, which provides number of establishments, number of employees, payroll, and receipts for each categor y of establishment. Recover ed material consumption by each category is also reported on the national level in those reports. Other sources of publicly a vailable data included U.S. Geological Survey reports and reports developed by individual state gover nments.  3.2.1.1 RELATION OF SIC AND NAICS TO BUSINESS CATEGORIES The U.S. Department of Commer ce, Bureau of the Census compiles and reports a wide range of economic data on U.S. industrial activity. Up until 1997, the Census Bureau categorized businesses according to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system developed by the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget. The system classified establishments by their primary activity. Beginning in 1997, the SIC system is being phased out and will be replaced by the new North Amer ican Industrial Classification System (NAICS). The new system harmonizes systems used in Mexico and Canada, in accordance with the North Amer ican Free Trade Agr eement. Table A-1, in Appendix A, attempts to classify each business category in the study by SIC and NAICS category code. The codes wer e assigned by comparing each business categor y to the definitions listed in the SIC and NAICS manuals. In many cases, the listed codes also include businesses not involved in recycling and reuse.  3.2.1.2 USE OF U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, BUREAU OF CENSUS STATISTICS The primary source of U.S. Census data used for this study was the 1997 Economic Census for releva nt NAICS codes, which was the most recent data available from the U.S. Census when this study was conducted. Although the Economic Census is only updated every five years, the U.S. Census updates its Standard Statistical Establishments List (SSEL) yearly, which could provide mor e current data than the Economic Census for future studies. See Appendix C for a sample of data provided by U.S. Census.  3.2.1.3 ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF EXISTING DATA Although the most commonly used existing data was the U.S. Census 1997 Economic Census, other sources provided throughput data or partial data for use in derivations or adjustments to original data. These sources of existing infor mation and their contributions include: R. W. Beck, Inc. 3-3   S  ECTION  3  Amer ica n Forest & Paper Association  State and nationa l throughput data for paper, paperboard, and deinked market pulp mills; Amer ica n Plastics Council  Database provided employment and throughput data for plastics reclaimers; Steel Recycling Institute  Expert opinion on the steel recycling process and percentage of activities to include in the study; and U.S. Geological Survey  Expert opinions on the recycling of nonferrous metals and the percentage of activities to include in the study for nonferrous product producers and nonferrous foundries.  3.2.2 S  URVEY DATA  When little or no existing data was available for a particular business category, but lists of establishments in those categories wer e available, R.W. Beck conducted surveys of those businesses and perfor med a statistical analysis of the results to develop estimates of economic activity.  3.2.2.1 RECYCLING ECONOMIC INFORMATION STUDY DATABASE R. W. Beck developed a database of Illinois establishments as a tool for surveying businesses in categories with little or no sources of existing economic data. The database was compiled from various electronic databases, recycling dir ectories, periodicals, and other sources. Although the database contains some recycling and reuse industry establishments that are not in survey categories, those listings are incidenta l incorporations from electronic dir ectories. Please refer to Table 3-1 for a listing of the survey categor ies for which the database was developed. Once the survey database was finalized, 543 establishments wer e listed as being in survey categories or as ""unknown,"" mea ning that their appropriate categorization was not known.  3.2.2.2 SURVEY DESIGN The survey was designed to obtain economic infor mation from businesses in categories with little or no existing infor mation. Appendix D contains a copy of the survey for ms that wer e used for this study. The survey cover page confir med the database records for company na me, mailing infor mation, physical location, and contact person. For companies with mor e than one physical location, one cover page and survey for each physical location wer e completed. The survey solicited responses to the following questions: 1. Classify the establishment accor ding to the categories defined for the study (respondents could check more tha n one categor y); 2. Identify the single categor y that is most representative of the recycling or reuserelated operations for the establishment; 3. Give estimations of establishment size including number of employees, total annual payroll, and total annual receipts; 4. Estimate the percentages of labor and receipts based on cover ed recycling activities; and 5. Estimate the a mounts, by type, of recycled materials processed. Checkboxes with associated ranges (i. e., 0-9 employees, $50,000-$149,999 total payroll) wer e used for questions regarding number of employees, payroll, receipts, and percentages. 3-4 R. W. Beck, Inc.   M  ETHODOLOGY  Due to the sensitive nature of the survey questions, it was anticipated that asking for responses in ranges rather than exact numbers would increase the response rate. With enough responses, any variation from the exact amount was likely averaged out.  3.2.2.3 SURVEY APPROACH All establishments in the database that were in survey categories (or whose categorization was not known) wer e mailed a survey. Further mor e, at least three follow-up telephone attempts wer e made to establishments that failed to respond to the mailed survey in order to obtain survey infor mation. Once surveys wer e completed, senior staff reviewed all survey data for accuracy and completeness. Responses wer e then enter ed into the REI Study database. After checking the database for errors, the raw data was compiled and analyzed using a statistical approach.  3.2.2.4 SURVEY CALCULATIONS A statistical analysis of the survey data provided by establishments that completed surveys was used to identify the recycling characteristics of the average establishment in each of the twelve survey business categories. These averages were then applied to all establishments in each survey category to estimate the number of employees11 involved in recycling activities, as well as the dollar value of recycling and reuse payroll and receipts. However, befor e making this extrapolation the list of non-responding establishments was exa mined to identify any establishments that were known to be very large, and whose economic activity would need to be estimated by some other means. During the survey process 138 establishments confir med they wer e in survey categories in the state of Illinois and provided data. This data formed the basis of the statistical analysis. Because many of the establishments initially included in the database wer e found to have been misclassified or gone out of business, it was necessary to re-estimate the number of establishments in each survey category befor e extrapolating average statistical data. Of the remaining Illinois establishments on the original contact list, 116 are likely to be in survey categories. Ther efor e, in Illinois, 254 establishments are believed to be involved in recycling activities in the twelve survey categories. For a detailed explanation of the statistical analysis of surveys, please refer to Appendix E.  3.2.3 DER  IVATION DATA  In the thir d strategy, derivations wer e ma de by using data from a variety of sources, such as trade organizations, industry experts, periodicals and other publications. Data points from various sources wer e pieced together to develop estimates of economic activity. As an exa mple of this approach, a detailed explanation of the sources and methodology used for both public and private curbside collection of recyclables is given in Section 4.2, note 6 of Table 4-2. Additionally, dir ect data for three of the four support business categories wer e derived as a result of economic modeling.  3.3 INTERMEDIATE INPUT DATA FOR ECONOMIC MODELING Prior to beginning economic modeling, the 26 dir ect recycling and reuse business categories wer e evaluated to identify those categories wher e recycling establishments wer e thought to significa ntly differ from similar non-r ecycling establishments in the way they operate, their process inputs, and their purchases from other establishments in the economy. Next, existing 11  Employee r esponses were adjusted to a full-time equivalent ba sis. Thu s, two employees each working 50% on recycling a ctivities would be counted a s one r ecycling employee.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  3-5   S  ECTION  3  in-house data from previous studies was exa mined to identify wher e recycling and reuse industry-specific data was lacking. For those categories lacking adequate input data, a detailed survey that asked for much gr eater detail regarding the cost elements of production was sent to select establishments. Those establishments that wer e cooperative and expressed inter est in the study during the gathering of the dir ect economic infor mation (employment, payroll, and revenues) wer e targeted for the additional surveys. Only a handful of establishments wer e targeted for each business categor y because the ma jor process inputs and cost elements of the businesses wer e assumed to be ver y similar to each other (and quite differ ent from the cost elements of virgin business establishments).  3.4 ECONOMIC MODELING This study modeled indir ect, induced, and total economic values of 26 categories of recycling or reuse establishments using the IMPLAN12 economic model. Economic modeling started with the purchase of data files that provided a standard interindustrial accounting of the Illinois economy. These data files wer e procured from Minnesota IMPLAN Group, Inc., the data supplier for the IMPLAN model. What followed was an eight-step process to construct a model that would isolate the 26 categories of recycling and reuse establishments from other establishments in the state so that their economic values could be separately analyzed and reported. The eight-step process is described below: 1. U.S. standard industrial classifications wer e identified that best corresponded to the kind of recycling product, process, or service that each of the 26 recycling and reuse categories produces. This was necessary because ther e is no specific set of ""r ecycling and reuse"" industries in the 537 industries contained in the data files. 2. These industrial types wer e contro industries wer e aggr egated to the produced, then, had twenty-six spec industrial aggregates (e.g., farming, transportation, etc.). lled for in the initial one-digit SIC level. ific recycling industry the rema inders of ma model while the rema ining The initial model that was candidates and twelve broad nufacturing, wholesale trade,  3. The dir ect values obtained from the study wer e substituted for the direct values (also called the ""social"" accounts) in the model. Estimates of returns to proprietors, property income, and indirect tax payments to state and local gover nments wer e derived from the averages of the original industrial group. This assumed that the recycling or reuse fir ms yield roughly the same r eturn on investment to sole proprietors or investors as the corresponding industry that may contain significant non-r ecycling establishments. 4. The rema ining values in the parent category (the original values minus the recycling industry dir ect values) wer e then ma nually placed back into the one-digit industrial sector so that the only dir ect data in the sector reflected the recycling and reuse industries. This ensur ed the model's total amount of industrial activity summed to precisely the same value as it had originally, befor e isolating recycling and reuse business categories. 5. Recycling and reuse establishments differ from non-r ecycling and reuse establishments in the way they operate, their process inputs, and their purchases from other establishments The modeling system used for this study is called IMPLAN Pr o, pu blished by the Minnesota IMPLAN Grou p, I nc. Data are a vailable and ma y be pur chased fr om this company for all states and all counties in the U.S. Their da ta sta ndar ds ar e r igor ous, their data sets are updated a nnually, and their methods for compiling and pr ocessing the main input-output data sets ar e widely consider ed to be a significa nt enha ncement of the ba sic I -O data that ar e compiled and solicited by the U.S. Bur eau of Economic Analysis. This compa ny has the largest user ba se of a ny of the commer cial input-output models a vaila ble in the U.S. 12  3-6  R. W. Beck, Inc.   M  ETHODOLOGY  in the economy. This step attempted to account for these differ ences with data from two sources: (1) the additional inter mediate input data that was collected as described previously; and (2) ""in-house"" data from other previous county-level studies that wer e conducted in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Wisconsin counties that reflected the kinds of recycling industries measured in this study but did not contain virgin-only establishments. Twelve models wer e built from in-house data from counties to isolate recycling industries (primarily ferrous and nonferrous metals, plastics manufacturing, and paper industries) and their production characteristics. The production inputs in the model wer e then r econfigur ed so that the industrial linkages to raw commodities, mining, or refiners wer e reduced and linka ges to recycling-r elated processors wer e strengthened. These cha nges resulted in a recalculation of all of the production input values for each r ecycling and reuse industry categor y. 6. Ther e are several other components to input-output modeling that were investigated. One modification involved changing regional purchase coefficients (RPCs) in the model. For some materials, recycled commodities ma y be shipped on a verage less or greater distances than the virgin alternative, including across state boundaries. In-house data from a previous Recycle Iowa Study (an early economic impact study of recycling) of the general likelihood of a recycled commodity being purchased locally for industrial usage was exa mined for its bearing on this study. Absent other infor mation about some commodity types, the RPC adjustment for a recycling commodity that was believed to be much more likely purchased locally was estimated by taking the square root of the existing number for that industry. For example, an RPC of 0.31 in a commodity supply category would be inflated to 0.56 to incr ease the likelihood that the input commodity was purchased locally. RPCs wer e only changed for a small subset of industries13 and wer e only done so to maximize the expected linka ge between recover ed materials collection, processing, and conversion into final dema nd goods. Ther e wer e other account categories that wer e assessed also in the INP UT-OUTPUT model. The bypr oducts category in the model itemizes the commodity production by industry. Each of these categories was scrutinized and assessed as to its reasonableness for each recycling or reuse industry. No other accounts categories wer e alter ed in the models (including exports, institutional dema nds, or household incomes). 7. The resulting model was then re-checked for errors, omissions, and reasonableness and re-estimated in final for m. This step included rebalancing the model so that the gross total equaled the original starting values. 8. Once the fina l state model was constructed, multipliers wer e generated for each recycling and reuse industry for Total Industrial Output, Personal Income, Va lue Added, and Jobs. These multipliers wer e applied to the original dir ect values to isolate each industry's unique economic contribution. In order to estimate government revenues associated with the economic data (dir ect as well as indir ect and induced), data on Illinois gover nment finances wer e gathered for 1992 through 1997 from the U.S. Census of Gover nments publications. Data on incomes wer e obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis Regional Economic Infor mation System. Annual incomes wer e converted to fiscal values, and the weighted average revenue incidences for state government own-source revenues14 was compiled for: All State Taxes (e.g., persona l, corporate, sales, use, excise, etc.);  RPC s were increa sed for the following categories: compost and miscellaneous or ganics producer s, pla stics reclaimer s, motor vehicle parts (u sed) ,and wood reu se. ""O wn-sour ce"" mea ns collected thr ough the state r evenu e system and not r eceived, for example, as a state disbursement of fu nds collected thr ough the federal r evenu e system. 14  13  R. W.

Local government (including counties, municipalities, school districts) revenue indices wer e calculated in a similar manner for fees. The revenue indices that wer e developed wer e then applied of industrial output and personal income to yield state and estimates. districts, and other special local own-source taxes and to the dir ect and total values local government revenue  3.5 VALIDATION OF STUDY RESULTS Upon completion of study results for the existing Illinois recycling and reuse industry, various methods of inter nal and external review wer e used to ensur e that both direct and indir ect study results wer e valid and mea ningful. The methods of inter nal review included: Review of completed surveys by senior staff; and Comparisons of per-establishment and per-employee figur es from Illinois to similar figures from other state and r egional studies. External review included a review of the direct economic infor mation for the 26 recycling and reuse categories by the DCEO. Further more, previous reviews by state gover nment staff and industry trade associations of the Northeast data produced by the NERC REI Study and the other state studies validated that the study methodology fairly characterized the level of economic activity for their state or industry. 15  3.6 INDUSTRY GROWTH SCENARIO PROJECTIONS The final remaining tasks included projections of the economic impact of thr ee recycling growth scenarios. The process for producing these projections included the following steps: 1. The effectiveness of specific policy and program options in achieving recycling objectives and increasing statewide r ecycling rates was researched; 2. A particular set of policy and program options to achieve each growth scenario was selected; 3. The ability of Illinois' current industry to collect, process, or utilize the additional recover ed materials in manufacturing operations was eva luated, consider ing whether Illinois is a net importer or exporter of grades of recover ed materials; 4. Growth projections wer e made for each of the 26 business categories by applying perestablishment and per-ton data from the existing industry to projected throughput incr eases  consideration was given to whether ma nufacturing growth would likely occur or whether feedstock substitution (with no net job incr eases) would occur; 5. Offsetting declines in economic activity in other industrial sectors (such as landfilling) wer e then identified so that net economic impacts were known; and 6. Illinois-specific indir ect, induced, and tax revenue impacts were projected for each growth scenario based on the modeling and tax revenue data that wer e previously developed.  15 Trade a ssociations that r eviewed the NERC study inclu ded the Amer ica n Forest & Paper Association, the American Plastics C ouncil, the I nstitute of Scra p R ecycling Indu stries, and the Steel R ecycling Institute.  3-8  R.

The section contains: A general description of the for mat for the U.S. Recycling and Reuse Industry data table; The U.S. Recycling and Reuse Industry data table of results, including number ed notes that correspond to specific data points in the table and explain how the data was derived; An analysis of the results; and A discussion of the accuracy and completeness of the results.  4.1 GENERAL NOTES ON DATA TABLES This section provides general information regarding the for mat of the U.S. Recycling and Reuse Industry data table presented in this section. Detailed descriptions of all table column hea dings and an explanation of the three tiers of data presented are given her e.  4.1.1 THREE-  TIERED APPROACH TO DATA PRESENTATION  Three facts about recycling and reuse businesses complicate recycling economic infor mation studies and ha ve led to inconsistency in past efforts: Most establishments involved in recycling and reuse are part of industries in which ma ny establishments do not recycle or reuse recover ed materia ls or products at all; Some establishments involved in recycling or reuse are also involved in non-r ecycling activities not intended to be cover ed in this study; and Many recycling manufacturers use less than 100 percent recycled feedstock and/or adjust the percentage of recycled feedstock throughout the year. Past studies have ha ndled each of these challenges differ ently. In an effort to exclude nonrecycling activities, some studies relied on survey r espondents to estimate recycling activities. Other studies ha ve targeted all facilities involved in recycling and did not attempt to adjust the statistics to account for non-recycling activities. Various industry and recycling experts have criticized both approaches. To overcome these challenges, the Illinois REI Study is reporting thr ee tiers of statistics. The goals of this approach are: To report statistics on recycling and reuse-r elated businesses as they actually exist in the economy (i. e., as part of industries and establishments that do not always involve recycling); and To derive conser vative estimates for the a mount of economic activity that can ""reasonably"" be attributed exclusively to recycling. The three tiers of statistics are described below.  4.1.1.1 TIER ONE - STATISTICS ON ALL INDUSTRY ESTABLISHMENTS Tier One statistics are reported only for certain business categories wher e data was available from a source that included all establishments in the categor y, even though some of them ma y not do any r ecycling. This information typically comes from U.S. Bureau of Census data by  W:\004016-NRC \032527-National R EI \R epor t\IL r eport\report.doc  4-1   S  ECTION  4  NAICS code. For example, data for all paper mills will be shown even though some of those establishments do not utilize recover ed paper.  4.1.1.2 TIER TWO - STATISTICS ON ESTABLISHMENTS INVOLVED IN RECYCLING Like Tier One, Tier Two statistics are only reported for certain business categories wher e data was available from a source that aggr egated data for recycling and non-recycling establishments. The data covers only those establishments that have some involvement in recycling, and attempts to exclude data on establishments with no recycling activities. Although all of these establishments perfor m some a mount of recycling or reuse activity, they ma y also perfor m non-recycling activities not cover ed in this report. For example, infor mation on all paper mills that utilize recover ed paper would be included her e, even though some of these establishments may also be involved in non-cover ed activities like production of wood pulp.  4.1.1.3 TIER THREE - STATISTICS ON COVERED RECYCLING ACTIVITIES Tier Three statistics are the heart of this study and are reported for all business categories. They are conser vative estimates of the portion of economic activity in Tier One or Tier Two that can be reasonably attributed to the recycling activities cover ed in the study. Most Tier Three estimates are derived from survey results in which r espondents themselves are asked to identify what percentage of their facility's activities involves ""cover ed activities.""16 For some important categories, including paper, plastics and metals manufacturers, an algorithm is being used to estimate cover ed economic activity. The algorithms begin with Tier One and Tier Two data as described above. Then, the percentage of Tier Two activity involving cover ed recycling activities is being estimated based on available statistics and industry expert opinions. The exact approach used for each categor y is documented in detail in Section 4.3. Additionally, Tier Three statistics are reported in two columns, depending on whether the establishments in the category are ""100 percent dependent on recycling,"" or simply ""undertaking recycling activities."" Those establishments that are dependent on recycling have 100 percent of employment and revenues der ived from r ecycling activities, while those that are ""undertaking recycling activities"" have only a portion of economic activity derived from r ecycling. This distinction is intended to assist in accurately and conser vatively reporting overall results and to further illuminate the actual structure of the recycling industry.  4.1.2 DEF  INITIONS OF COLUMN HEADINGS IN THE DATA TABLES  For Table 4-2, the letter ed column hea dings are defined as follows: A.

See Section 3.2.1.2 f or a detailed description of the use of Census Bureau statistics. 16 Data are taken directly from U.S. Census, 1997 Economic Census f or NAICS code 421930  Recyclable Material W holesalers. This category includes a number of different types of businesses including scrap metal and plastics dealers, C&D processors, benef iciation f acilities, crumb rubber producers and textile processors. No adjustments were made to Census data since the category is defined as 100 percent recycling-related. 17 Throughput f or Recyclable Material W holesalers is derived as f ollows: Gov ernment Staff ed Collection Throughput + Private Staff ed Collection Throughput  Compost/Organics Throughput  Materials Recov ery Facilities Throughput. 18 The 1997 Economic Census figures included five glass container manuf acturing establishments. Subsequent to the Census, one establishment was closed. Census f igures hav e theref ore been reduced by 20 percent due to the plant closure. 19 Throughput is estimated based on 1997 Economic Census reports showing a national average of 114 tons of cullet per employee multiplied by the number of Illinois employees. 20 Number of establishments and throughput are taken f rom Column D with no adjustments. Employment, annual payroll, and estimated receipts are derived from Column D with an adjustment for the percent of covered activities (90 percent). 21 Number of employees, payroll, and receipts f or Glass Product Producers are based on a statistical analysis of surv ey results f or Ohio. Those statistics were used because no Illinois establishments provided surv ey data. 22 Throughput is estimated as 76 tons per employee based on an av erage of surv ey responses f rom the Northeast, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, Nebraska, and Illinois and Glass Packaging Institute secondary glass use data of 614,000 tons per year nationally. 23 Data f or Nonf errous Smelting and Refining Mills is taken f rom the 1997 Economic Census f or NAICS codes 331314, 331423, and 331492. 24 Throughput f or nonf errous smelting and refining is estimated based on national scrap consumption for smelting and refining mills f rom the 1997 Economic Census and inf ormation from the USGS' publication Minerals Information  1997, Recycling  Metals. Allocation to the state level is based on a ratio of state employment to national employment f or this industry. 25 Employment, payroll, and receipts are derived from Column D with an adjustment f or the percent of covered activities (95 percent). Number of establishments and throughput are f rom Column D with no adjustment. 26 Data f or Nonf errous Product Producers is taken from the 1997 Economic Census f or NAICS codes 331315, 331316, 331319, and 331421 with no adjustments. 27 Data are derived by multiplying Column C figures by 50 percent, the percentage of establishments assumed to be utilizing scrap or recycled materials, based on comments f rom U.S.G.S. nonf errous metals specialists. 28 Throughput f or Nonf errous Product Producers is estimated based on nationwide scrap purchases f or this industry as reported in the 1997 Economic Census. Allocation to the state level is based on a ratio of state employment to national employment f or this industry. 29 Estimates of employees, payroll, and receipts are derived f rom Column D with an adjustment f or the percent of cov ered activities (90 percent). Number of establishments and throughput are f rom Column D with no adjustments. 30 Data f or Nonf errous Foundries is taken from the 1997 Economic Census f or NAICS codes 331521, 331524, 331525, and 331528, with no adjustments. 31 Throughput f or Nonf errous Foundries is estimated based on scrap purchases reported in the 1997 Economic Census. Total tons of scrap f or the U.S. is calculated as:  R. W. Beck, Inc.  4-9   S  ECTION  4  Total Scrap Cost (by NAICS code) / ($0.45/lb f or aluminum or $0.72/lb. f or copper) / (2,000 lbs/ton). Tons of scrap on a state-level is estimated as: Total tons x State Employees/U.S. Employees. 32 Data f or Paper, Paperboard, and Deinked Market Pulp Mills is taken from the 1997 Economic Census f or NAICS code 3221 with no adjustments. 33 Throughput is taken f rom the AF&PA Annual Statistical Summary Recovered Paper Utilization (April, 1999). Throughput numbers used are f or 1997 to coincide with the data from the 1997 Economic Census. 34 Estimates of employees, payroll, and receipts are derived f rom Column D with an adjustment f or the percent of cov ered activities (95 percent). Number of establishments and throughput are f rom Column D with no adjustments. AF&PA's Paper Matcher and Lockwood Post's Directory of the Pulp, Paper, and Allied Trades revealed that all Illinois paper mills depend on recov ered paper. 35 Throughput is estimated by multiplying employees times a tons per employee figure (277) derived f rom an average of surv ey responses f rom the U.S. Recycling Economic Inf ormation Study. 36 (D) indicates that figures cannot be reported in order to av oid disclosure of individual company inf ormation. 37 For Plastics Reclaimers, establishments, employees, and throughput are based on the American Plastics Council Handler & Reclaimer database dev eloped by R.W . Beck. Payroll is calculated by multiplying employment figures by Census Bureau's 1997 av erage wage f or Illinois plastics industry employees ($29,457). Estimated receipts is calculated by multiplying throughput of recycled resins produced times an average of recycled resin prices f rom Plastics News. Throughput is derived from per-employee averages from American Plastics Council statistics as compiled by R. W .

W . Beck, with additions f or pre-consumer plastics recycled). 41 Number of establishments and throughput are directly f rom Column D. Employees, payroll, and receipts are derived from Colum n D by multiplying by the estimated percent of employees at recycling-related establishments that are involv ed in covered recycling-related activities (80 percent). 42 Throughput is estimated by multiplying employees times a tons per employee figure (240) derived f rom an average of surv ey responses f rom the U.S. Recycling Economic Inf ormation Study. 43 Data f or Steel Mills comes from the 1997 Economic Census f or NAICS code 331111 with no adjustments. 44 Establishments, employees, payroll, and revenue figures are deriv ed from Column C by excluding non-integrated mills (NAICS 3311114), which do not make steel. 45 Throughput is calculated as state's percentage of national steel mill employees multiplied by the total tons of steel scrap consumed (1997 Economic Census) by steel mills nationally. 46 Employment, payroll, and receipts are equal to estimates f rom Column D multiplied by 95 percent (5 percent deduction to account for downstream conversion). Based on comments f rom SRI, 100 percent of steel mills are dependent on recovered steel to make new steel, utilizing anywhere from 15 percent-100 percent recov ered steel. Theref ore, the only deduction taken is to account f or non-cov ered activities. Establishments and throughput are f rom Column D with no adjustment. 47 For Iron and Steel Foundries, estimates f or column D are taken directly f rom U.S. Census SSEL with no adjustments.

Sector groupings include: Recycling Collection; Processing; Manufacturing; and Reuse and Rema nufacturing.  4.3.1 CO Figur es processi Figur es exceeds  MPARISON OF INDUSTRY SECTORS  4-1 and 4-2 compare the r elative sizes of the recycling collection, recycling ng, recycling ma nufacturing, and reuse/r ema nufacturing sectors of the industry.

Sales revenues, in turn, are used to employ persons and pay their wages, make payments on equipment, provide a return to owners and investors, and pay upstream supplier establishments for the value of their goods or services. The cost in ter ms of labor, equipment, etc. of perfor ming a particular process is a measure of the value that is added by that particular process. The progression in size from r ecycling collection to recycling processing to recycling ma nufacturing follows from the fact that those sectors are part of a chain wher e incr easingly mor e value is added to the recovered material as it moves through the recycling chain. Initially, a relatively small amount of va lue is added by consolidation (collection). Processors invest significa ntly mor e expense (value) in the recovered material by sorting and densification. However, no transformation of the recover ed material has yet occurred  the material has simply been concentrated. The gr eatest value is added in manufacturing wher e relatively useless raw materials of little value are made into useful products of considerable value. Reuse and rema nufacturing differ slightly in that they focus on consolidation and refurbishing of products (not raw materials) that still ha ve significant value; however, the value reuse adds cannot exceed the value inher ent in a new product made from raw materials  other wise people would buy the new product. This limits the a mount of value that can be added, and thus the size of the r euse sector compared to the ma nufacturing sector. Although the r euse and rema nufacturing sector comprises 39 percent of total establishments, it ma kes up only 13 percent of total employees, 7 percent of payroll, and 5 percent of receipts.20 These r eu se and r ema nufa cturing figures are thou ght to r epr esent the minimum amount of economic a ctivity captured by the methodology becau se r emanu facturing a ctivities ar e often included with traditional manu facturing industries that wer e not inclu ded in this stu dy. Several year s a go Boston Univer sity estimated rema nu facturing activities on the national level ( Pr ofessor Robert T. Lund, The Remanufacturing Industry: Hidden Giant, 1996). That stu dy suggested that r euse a nd r emanu facturing categor ies may be a s mu ch as thr ee times larger tha n that chara cterized by this stu dy's methodology. 20  R. W. Beck, Inc.  Re  4-15   S  ECTION  4 OF RECYCLING COLLECTION AND PROCESSING TO RECYCLING  4.3.2 COMPARISON MANUFACTURING Recycling industrial, recyclables processing  categories that are focused locally on recovering materials from commercial, and residentia l waste strea ms include establishments that collect and process for shipment to the recycling manufacturing industry. These local collection and establishments include the following categories of establishments:  Government staffed residentia l curbside collection; Privately-staffed residential curbside collection; Compost and miscellaneous organics products producers; Materials recover y facilities; and Recyclable material wholesalers. Alternatively, establishments in the recycling manufacturing sector are consider ed to be downstrea m consumers of recover ed materials who rely on local collectors and processors for their supply of materials. When the two gr oups are compar ed, local collection and processing ma ke up 19 percent of total recycling employment, 17 percent of recycling payroll, and 28 percent of r eceipts, wher eas downstrea m manufacturing ma kes up the rema ining 81 percent of employment, 83 percent of payroll, and 72 percent of receipts. This suggests that public policy to encourage recycling and discourage disposal and public and private investment in local recyclables collection and processing infrastructure pay great dividends in supporting significa nt downstrea m private recycling economic activity.  4.3.3 LARGE  ST CONTRIBUTORS  Upon closer examination of Table 4-2, over half of the economic activity for the entire recycling and reuse industry is accounted for by the following four categories of establishments: Plastics converters, which employ 12,195 people and gross $1.9 billion in annual receipts; Steel mills, which employ 9,199 people and gross $2.9 billion in annual receipts; Recyclable material wholesalers, which employ 6,104 people and gross $3.0 billion in annual receipts; and Iron and steel foundries, which employ 5,789 employees and gross $0.8 billion in annual receipts. These four categories alone account for 59 percent of all employees, 64 percent of wages, and 71 percent of total receipts. Figures 4-3 and 4-4 place this infor mation into further perspective by showing how the size of Illinois' major recyclable materials manufacturing industries compare to each other. As the figures show, the metals and plastics recycling manufacturing industries contribute predomina ntly to recycling ma nufacturing's overall size.  4-16  R. W.

When large quantities of a high-value commodity are returned to the stream of commer ce, the large amount of intrinsic value r eturned to the economy can support mor e jobs and economic activity than if a lesser amount or lower value commodity is returned to the strea m of commerce. Plastics and non-ferrous metals are at the top of the value scale, ferrous metals and paper are in the middle, and glass and compost are at the low end of the value scale. Major material group recycling a mounts as estimated by this study are: Yard waste  335 thousand tons (recycling of other organic materials is negligible); R. W. Beck, Inc. 4-17   S  ECTION  4  Glass  151 thousand tons; Nonferrous metals  424 thousand tons; Plastics  378 thousand tons; Paper  902 thousand tons; and Ferrous metals  4,262 thousand tons. When both the a mount recycled and value are considered together, the relative sizes of the various material groups can be explained. Similarly, estimates can be ma de of the economic impact that results from incr eased diversion of the various materials.  4.3.4 THE RECYCL  ING AND REUSE INDUSTRY IN PERSPECTIVE  Figur es 4-5, 4-6, and 4-7 show how Illinois' recycling and reuse industry compares to other select state industries.21 These industries wer e chosen because they present alternatives to recycling and reuse (i.e., waste ma nagement and mining) or because they are consider ed to be important or preferred industries that are often targeted by economic developers.

Com  Payroll Receipts  put er  &  Mi ni ng  4-19   S  ECTION  4  4.4 ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF RESULTS The results of this study for the categories identified are thought to be realistic and generally conser vative. The results for categories which used existing U.S. Census data are believed to be the most accurate, followed by data for survey categor ies, while the der ivations are likely to be the least accurate because of the limited a mount of available data for estimations. Census data, although updated yearly, lags in publication by three years so that data is not as current as data for survey categories. Survey data is current; however, confidence intervals for total employment, payroll, and receipts for certain categories are quite large because of the small number of establishments in those categories. The study did encounter a number of limitations that impacted the ability to accurately capture all recycling and reuse activity. The limitations of the study include: Survey for ms asked for data in intervals rather than discr ete numbers; Certain business categories that could be industry wer e excluded because data was remanufacturers, for which only a one-time which lists of contact infor mation are not shops, ther e is significant debate on the typ (e.g., automobile r epair establishments). consider ed part of the recycling and reuse not available. Most notable is equipment national-level study was conducted, and for maintained. In other cases, such as repair es of repair activities that should be counted  Many establishments in rapidly growing recycling and reuse sectors, or those that were recycling non-traditional materials (such as fluor escent la mps and carpets) may not have been fully listed in recycling dir ectories, and thus their activity ma y be underrepresented in the overall results. Some derivations, such as that for plastics converters, are based on the best of several less-than-desirable options available; it is very difficult to assess the accuracy of those results. Although the study was not able to capture every possible type of recycling and reuse activity, it is reasonably accurate for the categories shown and conservatively estimates the total amount of recycling and reuse activity taking place.  4.5 COMPARISONS TO OTHER STATES Several states conducted REI studies using the sa me standardized REI methodology used for this study. Therefor e, the results for those states generally can be compared to the totals for Illinois found in this report. The sa me can be said for the National REI study results. The overall results for California, Dela ware, Florida, Illinois, India na, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Yor k, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Ver mont are compared in this section. Befor e comparing the state data, however, differ ences between those studies (such as year for which data wer e obtained) should be noted.  4.5.1 D  IFFERENCES IN  REI S  TUDIES  Differ ences in REI studies can generally be traced to two areas: Existing data source cha nges; Methodological changes between studies.  4.5.1.1 EXISTING DATA SOURCE CHANGES As was discussed in Section 3.2, the SIC system is being eliminated and replaced with the NAICS system. NAICS data was not yet available for the NERC states (Dela ware, 4-20 R. W. Beck, Inc.   S  TUDY RESULTS  Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ver mont), Florida, Nebraska, Indiana or Ohio studies when their data was compiled, so 1996 Census SIC data was used. However, 1997 Census NAICS data beca me available in time to be used for this study as well as the national and California studies. Apart from the one-year differ ence in the data and the effect of inflation on fiscal values, the cha ngeover between systems caused some differ ences in the wa y certain Census categories wer e defined, and thus the source data used for certain recycling and reuse business categories. The tir e retrea ders category includes mor e establishments in the SIC code than wer e included when reclassified under NAICS system. Because the tir e retreader category is sma ll compared to all the other categories (generally less than one percent of the total for the total recycling and reuse industry), this differ ence is not thought to significantly affect the overall bottom-line r esults of state studies. U.S. Census subdivides iron and steel mills into four sub-components  fully integrated, partially integrated with a blast furnace, partially integrated without a blast furnace, and nonintegrated  though it only reports sub-component data on the national level. Non-integrated mills, which do not recycle steel scrap but instead convert steel inter mediates made by other steel mills into products, are outside the boundary of the definition for the recycling and reuse industry used in this study. The fact that these conversion mills wer e included by U.S. Census in state-level ir on and steel mill data was not apparent at the time the NERC study was conducted, ther efore recycling and reuse industry data for steel mills wer e over estimated for Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Yor k, and Pennsylvania. Data from nonintegrated mills wer e excluded fr om all other state studies and the US REI study. It is important to note that non-integrated steel mills are much smaller than integrated steel mills that recycle steel. Although these non-integrated mills represent 64 percent of the number of ""steel mill"" establishments in the nation, they r epresent less tha n 15 percent of employment, payroll, and receipts reported by Census. Further mor e, employment, payroll and receipts are typically much better measures of economic contribution than number of establishments, and the bottom-line impact of including non-integrated mills affected the overall NERC study results by less tha n 4 percent for these measures.  4.5.1.2 METHODOLOGICAL CHANGE BETWEEN STUDIES Ther e was one minor change in methodology among the various REI studies. Census NAICS data for glass container ma nufacturers were used for this study as well as the California and national studies. Surveys of glass container manufacturers were conducted for all the other state studies because ther e wer e too few glass container manufacturers in those states for Census to be able to report that infor mation without disclosing individual compa ny data.  4.5.2 CO  MPARISON OF  REI S  TUDY RESULTS  One important conclusion to draw from the REI studies that have been done is that the recycling and reuse industry is not monolithic, but does displa y variations between states, particularly in the size of establishments. The compost and miscellaneous organics producer category exemplifies this point. Compost sites are distinctly larger in ter ms of number of employees per establishment, payroll, and receipts in Southern and West Coast states than in Illinois. It is thought that climate and seasona l differ ences may play a role in the differ ence, as there is little yard waste to compost in Illinois during the winter. Considering the ca veats discussed above, comparisons wer e ma de between states as shown in Figur es 4-8 and 4-9. Figure 4-8 shows actual recycling/reuse employment numbers on the left, as well as normalized r ecycling/reuse employment (on a per 100,000 state population basis) on the right. As the figure shows, Illinois compares favorably to other states, exceeding the nor malized national average of recycling and reuse industry employees. R. W.

This is particularly apparent in states that have traditionally valued the contribution of manufacturing establishments to their economies, such as Illinois, India na, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Further mor e, steel and iron recycling manufacturing business categories are well-developed in each of these four leading states, ranging from approximately 40 percent of the r ecycling ma nufacturing total in Illinois to as much as 70 percent of the r ecycling manufacturing sector total in Indiana.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  4-23   ECTION 5 INDIRECT AND INDUCED ECONOMIC INFORMATION  S  5.1 OVERVIEW This study modeled the economic values of twenty-six recycling or reuse categories. Further calculations wer e ma de to estimate selected state government revenues that would be associated with the levels of economic activity that were identified through the modeling process. This section provides an overview of the process of input-output modeling, its strengths, its limitations, and its adaptation to this study. This section also defines the ter ms used. Finally, the model output data are presented and interpreted.  5.1.1 INPUT-O  UTPUT  M  ODELING PROCESS AND LIMITATIONS  Economic values or economic effects studies are usually conducted with input-output (I-O) econometric models of a regional economy. Input-output modeling allows researchers to investigate the interdependencies that industries, institutions, and households have with each other in a region of study. I-O models, therefor e, relate the products made within a region and the products consumed by industries and households in that same region. At a basic level, any industry's or institution's output (usually its gross sales) requires employees, materials, utilities, capital investments, financing, maintenance, equipment, and service inputs. The probability that a firm purchases its inputs locally (mea ning within the region being modeled) is estimated in the I-O model. Estimates of an industry's inputs mix and whether those inputs are purchased within the r egion being modeled are based on national and regional industrial surveys. Primary survey information to update the national or regiona l statistics is needed to improve the quality of the model output, particularly wher e the industry segment under study may differ from national or regional averages. As was discussed previously in the Study Methodology section, this study perfor med limited surveys to obtain additional inter mediate input data. Further more, it made use of in-house data from previous county-level a nd statelevel modeling projects to further improve the quality of the model that was produced. Ther e are important limitations to these models that must be acknowledged. First and for emost, absent highly detailed and costly local industry surveys, which wer e not done for this study, nationa l and regional averages for ma jor industrial input categories (the production functions) and the likelihood of a local purchase of inputs for the industries that were studied (regional purchasing coefficients) wer e still hea vily relied on. Industries that fall within general industrial categories nor mally have very similar industrial input characteristics. A plastics fir m that produces finished goods from recycled stock will be configur ed ver y similarly to a plastics firm that produces goods primarily from virgin inputs. Except for the source of their commodity input into production and the physica l configuration of their processing machiner y, their overall rema ining operational characteristics  transportation, utilities, services, maintenance, fina ncial inputs, etc.  are likely to be very similar. Consequently, in most instances, production characteristics of existing fir ms provided a very good first pass at identifying intra-regional linkages and supply chains of goods and services requir ed for production. Although the I-O model has infor mation on up to 537 industries, ther e is no specific set of ""r ecycling and reuse"" industries. Consequently, the models that wer e produced were significa ntly modified to accept recycling and reuse industries distinctly. Further mor e, the use of in-house data and additiona l surveys for select recycling and reuse industries enhanced the quality of the model output for this study. Other limits in these types of models include: W:\004016-NRC \032527-National R EI \R epor t\IL r eport\report.doc  5-1   S  ECTION  5  Difficulties in capturing economies of scale, particularly for industries with relatively sma ll numbers of establishments, wher e establishment-to-establishment variation ma y be significant (the current input values or production functions are, therefor e, initially constant); An inability to identify input substitutes  especially in new technologies or in instances wher e input modes have cha nged; Dated data on industrial perfor mance and purchases, particularly for industries that are newly-emer ging or rapidly changing; In-state and out-of-state purchases of commodities within a study area are fixed (regional purchasing coefficients must be adjusted if it is suspected that the regional averages are not right); and An implicit assumption that input commodity supply is infinite and perfectly elastic. I-O models, ther efor e, are just that  models  that simulate industrial inter-dependencies in the current economy under study. I-O models are not the best models for forecasting because they model the existing economy, and do not for ecast the net impact of replacing a virgincommodity establishment with a recycled-commodity establishment, for exa mple, or the availability of suitably-trained workers to accommodate industry growth. I-O models, ther efore, have limits. Nevertheless, I-O models are comparably much less expensive to produce than mor e involved models, do an excellent job of estimating the role a particular industry has (such as the recycling industry) on a specific economy, and are useful for projecting the affects of modest changes in an industry. The generic ter m ""economic impact"" is frequently used to describe a set of economic activities in a region. This ter m often suffers from misapplication. Ther e are several kinds of economic activities that ma y occur within a particular region. For example: Firms may produce goods or provide services for export outside the region. They attract outside funds into the region that supports employment, industrial purchases, and household spending. Firms may substitute locally produced commodity inputs for those that previously wer e purchased from outside the r egion. In this case funds are retained in the region and flow to local suppliers to an industry. Firms may produce goods and services for local consumption (either by industries or by households). Although they ma y help to retain funds in the r egion, they may not cause significa nt additional economic activity. I-O models identify the overall size and contribution of an industry  its economic effect or economic value  to the area mix of economic activity along with interdependencies that exist between it and other fir ms or service suppliers. In other wor ds, the strength of linkages that exist among industries and the overall value (output, incomes, and jobs) of their production. The impact of an industry hasn't yet been deter mined. In the case of fir ms that produce finished goods for export outside a region, ther e is a measurable economic impact  wer e it not for the external dema nd for the locally-produced product, the economic activity would not be in the local economy. A much harder measure of potential economic impact falls into the category of import substitution. If a region is able to develop indigenous industries that produce a good that substitutes for a good that is imported, then that industry is retaining dollars in the state that used to be exported. An industry that produces a good using recycled feedstock that is supplied locally will cr eate a product that substitutes loca l inputs for non-local inputs. Recycling industries often fit into the import substitution categor y, particularly in states 5-2 R. W. Beck, Inc.   INDIRECT  AND INDUCED ECONOMIC INFORMATION  without virgin feedstock production infrastructures. By utilizing recycled content, they are purchasing locally and, therefore, stimulating indigenous economic activity. This study generally reser ves the use of the ter m economic impact only for: Industries that have ver ifiable levels of exports wher e the output that they are producing is a genuine and real incr ease in regional industrial output; True import substitutes; and Policy or program changes that result in incr eases in recycling and reuse and accompa nying increases in industrial output. To claim economic impacts involves much more extensive industrial measures for each category of establishments that was assessed in this study, and over a period of time because impacts are referenced fr om a particular point in time. This study, ther efor e, reports total economic values of the current recycling and reuse industry  estimates, by categor y, of the value of economic inter-relationships that exist for the industry. These values are the intrinsic worth of a set of industrial activities  they represent a slice of the economic pie from a particular point of view. Impacts are presented for projected increases in recycling that result from three industry growth scenarios that are driven by proposed policy and program changes. In summary, economic models are estimates of inter-industrial linkages and regional values. They are based on an amalga m of federal, county, and state data, academic procedur es, along with some survey-der ived dir ect data, all compiled with due diligence for accuracy and reasonableness. Consequently, although an inter-industrial accounting framework is implied, all estimates are simulations of economic values based on the data employed and the assumptions implicit in the modeling.  5.1.2 K  INDS OF ECONOMIC INFORMATION PRODUCED BY  I-O M  ODELS  Input-output models produce many kinds of data for analysis and decision ma king. The more useful results for industrial leaders, planners, and policy ma kers are estimates of (1) total industrial output, (2) personal income, (3) value added, and (4) jobs. These are the categories of economic activity that are reported in detail in the data tables that follow this section. These ter ms are defined below: Total industrial output for most private industries is simply gross sales. For public or quasi-public institutions this nor mally includes all public outla ys, along with the value of government sales and other subsidies received, to isolate the current economic value of their output to the citizens or the area served. Personal income includes the wa ges and salaries of employees and proprietors, nor mal profits to sole proprietors, and an estimate of the cash value of all benefits (e.g., social insurance, retirement, and medical benefits). Value added is a measure of gross regional product. It includes all personal income (employment compensation, incomes to sole proprietors) plus property incomes (dividends, inter ests, and rents), and indirect tax payments (primarily excise and sales taxes paid by individuals to businesses). Jobs is the number of full- and part-time positions in the economy, not the number of full-time-equivalents. 22 This distinction is important because the relationship between job growth and labor force growth is ver y differ ent in differ ent industries. Some 22  For exa mple, a r estaurant ma y employ 20 people on a half-time ba sis (20 jobs) to fill its labor r equir ement of 10 full-time-equivalents.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  5-3   S  ECTION  5 ies rely hea vily on semi-skilled part-time labor. Other industries generally e full-time skilled jobs. It is always important, when possible, to qua ntitatively whether the jobs that are stimulated are part-time or full-time or higher-paying lower-paying.  industr produc assess versus  Economic data is further reported as direct, indir ect, induced, and total economic effects. Direct effects refer to the operational characteristics of the fir ms or institutions that are studied. This study measured the apparent value of twenty-six categories of recycling and reuse establishments. The dir ect output of these entities is, therefor e, their reported gross sales. The dir ect jobs are the jobs that are associated with those establishments. The dir ect personal income contains their reported payments to all employees, plus an additional estimate of benefit values and of returns to sole proprietors. The estimate of benefit values and returns to sole proprietors were based on industrial averages in industries that are similar to the recycling and reuse industries included in this study. Indirect effects measure the value of additional economic dema nds that the direct fir ms or institutions place on supplying industries in the region. When fir ms produce goods or conduct business or when public entities provide public services, they must make ma ny purchases. Some of these are from suppliers in the area. Some are not. Public utilities, communications systems, fuel, wholesale goods and services, manufactured goods, financial and legal services, raw and processed commodities, and a variety of professional services are necessary to produce the direct values described above. Induced effects accrue when workers in the direct and indir ect industries spend their earnings on goods and services in the r egion. Induced effects can also be called household effects, and the ter ms are often used inter-changeably. When workers in direct and indirect industries purchase goods and services for household consumption, they, in turn, stimulate another layer of the economy. Most induced activity accrues to retail, services, and finance, insurance, and housing spending. Because employment is stimulated in these industries as well, their dema nds for inputs incr ease, yielding an additional round or additional rounds of indirect purchases and additional rounds of induced activity. The I-O models solve for these iterative rounds of transactions until all of the possible inter-industrial transactions have been accumulated. Total economic effects are the sum of direct, indirect, and induced effects. They are all of the transactions attributable, either dir ectly or indir ectly, to the activities of establishments in the business categories included in this study. The ter m multiplier or multiplier effect is frequently used when referring to economic effects or economic impacts. Ther e are differ ent kinds of multipliers  this study reports two types. The Type I multiplier identifies the value of direct and indir ect transactions  e.g., the output of a business category and all other output that it purchases from its suppliers in the region  relative to the value of only the direct transactions. The Type II multiplier identifies the value of all economic transactions (direct, indirect, and induced) that are stimulated in the economy by an industry under study, including the personal spending of employees throughout the supply chain whose economic activity is apportioned to the industry, relative to the value of only the dir ect transactions.  5.2 RESULTS Table 5-1 shows estimates of economic activity accruing to establishments in business categories that provide goods or services to recycling and reuse industry establishments. The category Other Indirect Establishments shown in the table includes all other indir ect establishments that provide goods or services (such as office supply companies, accounting fir ms, legal fir ms, building and la ndscape maintena nce fir ms, etc.). 5-4 R. W. Beck, Inc.   INDIRECT  AND INDUCED ECONOMIC INFORMATION  As Table 5-1 shows, the indir ect economic activity accruing to Recycling and Reuse Equipment Manufacturers and Transporters composes a significa nt portion of the total indir ect effects, representing 9-13 percent depending on the data type that is consider ed. It is important to note that the data for Recycling and Reuse Equipment Manufacturers is based on a statistical analysis of survey data and ther efore r epresents complete data for those types of establishments located in a state regardless of wher e they sell their equipment.

Economic values are most accurate at the business categor y level. Summing totals by groups of recycling or reuse activity for the state as a whole (as has been done in the tables) results in some degr ee of duplicated accounting of economic activity. This is true for any set of industrial assessments in any input-output modeling scenario  it is not a problem with recycling, per se, nor with this study, but arises simply because of the ma ny business categories that are included in this study. 5-8 R. W. Beck, Inc.   INDIRECT  AND INDUCED ECONOMIC INFORMATION  For example, direct sales by a raw commodity processor represent an input purchase by an industry producing a finished good for sale. A large portion of the raw commodity processor's direct sales is already reflected in the finished good industry's input purchases. In this case, then, aggr egation biases the economic values in the subtotals and totals upwards. As a general rule, the higher the Type I multiplier (which is a measure of how strongly a fir m depends on supplier inputs), the higher the probability of aggr egation bias in r eporting subtotals and totals. This is an inher ent ""Catch 22"" in input-output modeling: to eliminate aggr egation bias of this sort, the industries must be lumped together in the construction of the model so that inter-industrial transactions are properly accounted and the resulting multipliers are properly da mpened. Doing so, however, eliminates the industrial detail that is desir ed. Nevertheless, subtotals and totals ha ve been produced so that relative comparisons can be ma de. Users of these findings, however, must be cautious to avoid claims about the recycling and reuse industry that ma y be unwarranted given that there is some degr ee of inflation in the subtotals or totals. Based on other modeling experience, it is believed that aggregation bias ma y ha ve inflated the subtotals and totals by up to 15 percent, and possibly higher. It is important to note that this bias is associated with any total that is derived from indir ect and induced infor mation, including total economic activity, subtotal/total multipliers, and total government tax revenues. Alternatively, totals derived only from direct infor mation and government tax revenues derived from direct economic activity do not include bias. Multipliers reveal potential changes in the r egional economy attributable to a change in dir ect activity in a particular industry in that same economy. Multipliers can be instructive for anticipating economic growth, in the case of a new or expanding fir m, and economic decline, in the case of a plant closing. Economic multipliers are often misunderstood and ther efor e improper ly used. Developers, planners, and decision-ma kers frequently use nationa l level multipliers that are produced by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) as points of comparison. These multipliers are called RIMS II (Regiona l Input-Output Multiplier System), and they are widely used by development gr oups to support economic investment or public spending. Multipliers are available for over 500 industries in the categories of earnings, employment, and industrial output. Many users, however, mistakenly apply these statistics because they: Fail to account for regional production and cost of living differ ences (deta iled multipliers are available at the state and county level, but project promoters often rely on national averages due to costs); Use the wrong multiplier to describe a phenomenon (multipliers for differ ent categories of economic activity can vary substantially); or Seek to promote industries with the largest multipliers possible without consideration of either the appropriateness of the application or of the actual scope of local production. The rea der can be assured that this study produced Type I and Type II multipliers that are specific to Illinois and are not dir ectly derivative of nationa l averages. Befor e making any comparisons a mong multipliers, it is important to understand what influences them. Firms with strong linka ges to area supplying fir ms or that pay relatively high wages ma y yield comparatively higher multipliers. Firms that are other wise not linked strongly to local suppliers or that pay lower than average wages will usually produce lower multipliers. More urbanized areas and states with larger and more diversified economies have, on the average, much higher multipliers than less populated, mor e rural states for the same types of businesses. Given the above guides to interpreting the data, there are a couple of general conclusions that can be drawn:  R. W. Beck, Inc.  5-9   S  ECTION  5  Illinois non-ferrous smelting and refining mills, non-ferrous product producers, and steel mills tended to have higher multipliers than establishments in other business categories (Table 5-3). When compared to other primary economic sectors, the Illinois recycling and reuse industry surpasses all but the ma nufacturing sector in ter ms of multiplier size (Table 54). The recycling and reuse industry is responsible for significant state and local government tax revenues, totaling over $680 million per year when indir ect and induced economic activity are included. These r evenues are nearly split equally between the state and local gover nments (Table 5-5). Investments in local recycling collection and processing and policies that encourage recycling and reuse yield significa nt state and local gover nment revenues from downstrea m economic activity. For example, 81 percent of total recycling and reuse industry tax revenues arise from r ecycling ma nufacturing establishments and their indir ect and induced economic activity (Tables 5-4 and 5-5). Recycling manufacturing establishments are critical to the strength of Illinois' recycling and reuse industry and overall state economy. This industrial sector has a dema nd for more recover ed materials than are recover ed in the state  thus materials must be imported from other states and countries. Many of the inter mediate products of recycling ma nufacturing establishments support other ma nufacturing jobs in the state or result in the flow of profits into the state from the sale of those products outside Illinois' borders. Illinois' economy significa ntly benefits from this industrial sector in ter ms of the jobs it provides, support it gives to the state's manufacturing base and other economic sectors, and tax revenues that flow to the state and local governments. Even though some categories have lower multipliers than other categories, they are still important to the overall recycling and reuse industry. For exa mple, recycling manufacturing establishments, which tend to have higher multipliers, rely on recycling collection and processing establishments to provide them with recovered materials. Recycling collection and processing establishments  even though they tend to have lower multipliers  are critical and necessary links in the recycling chain and should be valued and supported as much as establishments in other categories with higher multipliers.  5-10  R. W. Beck, Inc.   F  UTURE  GRO  WTH  SECTION 6 SCENARIOS  In addition to gather ing economic infor mation on the current Illinois recycling and reuse industry, this study also summarized infor mation on barriers and impediments to increased recycling and reuse activity, the ability of policy and progra ms to promote future growth, and the cost and benefits associated with various policy and program options. Further mor e, projections of the economic impacts of thr ee specific industry growth scenarios wer e ma de. The thr ee scenarios wer e: Achieving a 35 percent state recycling rate; Achieving a 50 percent state recycling rate; and Banning the disposal of electronics in Illinois landfills.  6.1 BARRIERS AND IMPEDIMENTS TO INCREASED RECOVERY Many products that could be easily diverted for recycling are disposed. The reasons are ma ny and varied, and differ from product to product. Barriers and impediments to increased recovery can be generally gr ouped into four general areas: 1. Recover y Infrastructure  are there convenient recyclables collection, processing, and transportation infrastructures in place? 2. Behavior  do people participate in available progra ms, and if they participate to what extent are they capturing all r ecyclables? 3. Economics  do low disposal costs limit reaching higher recover y rates? 4. End Markets  is ther e sufficient end market capacity for new r ecover ed materials or incr eases in recover y of materials already targeted? The following sections discuss barriers and impediments to increased recycling in general, and specifically identify those barriers and impediments that apply to the thr ee industry growth scenarios consider ed as part of this analysis.  6.1.1 REC  OVERY INFRASTRUCTURE  6.1.1.1 COLLECTION INFRASTRUCTURE Roughly two-thirds of Illinoisans have access to a convenient residential recyclables collection program. In this report, ""convenient"" refers to curbside r ecyclables collection for single-fa mily homes and on-site recyclables collection for multi-fa mily residences. The fact that a full one-third of Illinois residents lack convenient recycling access is an impediment to incr eased recover y, particularly if 35 percent and 50 percent recycling rates are desired. Although it is estimated that 77 percent of single-fa mily homes are provided with curbside recyclables collection access, only 20 percent of multi-fa mily residences have similar collection access.23 Accurate data establishments believed to be perhaps more, on the number or percentage of industrial, commercial, or institutional (ICI) that have implemented r ecycling programs is not available, though it is extensive. In fact, R. W. Beck estimates that as much as 80 percent, and of the total tons of recyclables that are recover ed in Illinois are diverted from  23  Based on statistics gather ed by the Illinois Recycling Association' s 1998 State Recycling Survey.  W:\004016-NRC \032527-National R EI \R epor t\IL r eport\report.doc  6-1   S  ECTION  6  the non-r esidential ICI waste stream, even though this waste stream composes an estimated 50 to 60 percent of the total waste generated. The recyclables commonly targeted by these types of non-residential programs include scrap metal, paper (primarily corrugated boxes and office paper), construction and demolition debris, and other materials. Achieving 35 and 50 percent statewide recycling rates will require increases in the collection of commerciallygenerated recyclables. Even when recyclables collection programs are established, they nor mally target only a few items that may not compose a large portion of the total solid waste strea m as generated. For exa mple, residential recyclables collection programs normally target approximately onequarter of the solid waste that is generated at residences. Thus a lack of collection access for a broader range of materials is an impediment to increased diversion  particularly for the electronics recycling scenario. Establishing a ban on electronics disposal will requir e establishing a recycling collection infrastructure for electronics beyond the r epair and reuse industries that currently exist.  6.1.1.2 PROCESSING INFRASTRUCTURE While processing infrastructure24 can be said to be sufficient for current levels and materials targeted for recycling, the infrastructure will need to incr ease commensurately with incr easing levels of diversion, as most facilities are fairly well utilized at current levels of diversion. Furthermor e, increases in the numbers of materials recover ed in existing or new recovery programs may require facility technology and equipment retrofits so that additional sorts or processes can be perfor med. Examples of such r etrofits include installing mechanized sorting systems for mixed paper collection, upgrading separation systems for recyclables that are collected in a single commingled strea m (e. g., single-strea m curbside collection and bag-based collection), and establishing processing systems for electronics. If significa nt diversion increases or disposal bans are targeted for select materials  such as electronics, construction and demolition debris, or other specific materials  new processing facilities will need to be constructed.  6.1.1.3 TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE Illinois has one of the best transportation infrastructures in the United States for recover ed materials, with excellent access to a variety of modes of transportation including interstate highwa y, rail, Great Lakes shipping, and Mississippi River barge shipping. Only two other states exceed Illinois in the number of interstate highway miles in their states  Texas and California  and those states are significantly larger in geographic size and population than Illinois. Transportation infrastructure can therefore be consider ed ver y good, even at incr eased levels of recover y. Illinois also enjoys close proximity to ma ny ma jor markets for recover ed materials that are located either instate or in adjoining states. For example, 25 percent of national recover ed paper consumption by paper and paperboard mills occurs in Illinois and adjoining states. Similar statements can be made concer ning ferrous and non-ferrous metals markets.  6.1.2 BEH  AVIOR  6.1.2.1 PARTICIPATION Even when people have convenient access to recyclables collection programs they do not always participate.

Even among those who participate in recycling programs, it is common that the capture rate is less than 100%. Typically, capture rates for containers at participating households vary from 55 percent for plastic bottles to 80 percent for glass containers.26 A few of the reasons for less than full recovery include: Undersized collection bins or containers that lead to disposal of recyclables after the recyclables collection container fills; Conta mination by contained products that don't rinse out easily (or spoila ge of the contents) lea ding to disposal of the container; Confusion over which products are targeted (this is particularly the case for plastic bottles that are not beverage containers), and being taught ""when in doubt lea ve it out""; and Lack of participation by all householders, even though at least one householder does segr egate recyclables.  6.1.3 E  CONOMICS  The role of local gover nments is to provide for the public good. In many jurisdictions, local governments have concluded that the public good requires gover nmental involvement in ensuring that solid waste collection services are provided to single-fa mily residences at fair prices. In some cases this involvement includes providing municipal collection of solid waste; in other cases, local gover nments set up franchises or contracts with private collectors to provide established service levels at set prices. When local governments do not participate in solid waste collection, free-market open competition occurs among private waste haulers or citizens self-haul to public or private disposal locations. In ma ny cases, loca l governments have concluded that ther e is not a need for them municipal involvement in the collection of solid waste from multi-fa mily homes and commercial establishments. The greater generation amounts and consolidation of solid waste from these types of establishments in many cases can ensure adequate competition and efficient collection. When local gover nments are involved in the collection of solid waste, either dir ectly or through contracts or franchises, they can control the services that are provided (e.g., providing recyclables collection services) and wher e solid waste is ultimately disposed if they so elect. In open competition haulers typically decide if ther e is an economic incentive to offer recyclables collection ser vices and customers decide if they want to pay for those services and participate in the available programs. Further more, in open systems local governments cannot pass ""flow control"" or dina nces, mea ning that the solid waste hauler can choose the lowest-cost disposal site, including disposal sites that are located out-of-state. 27 Because compr ehensive r ecyclables collection programs are often more expensive than Participation, a s mea sured over an extended period of time ( such a s one month) is always gr eater tha n the percenta ge of homes that set out r ecycla bles on a given collection da y. 26 27 25  ""How to Collect Pla stics for Recycling,"" the American Plastics Council, 1995.

Beck, Inc.  6-3   S  ECTION  6  disposal, many business and apartment mana gers elect to not provide for comprehensive recycling programs. Thus, it can be said that the low cost of solid waste disposal is an obstacle to increased recycling. In an attempt to level the competitive playing field for all solid waste collection service providers, some local gover nments have passed commercial recycling ordinances that requir e recycling programs. In Illinois, areas with these ordinances have a weighted average recycling rate of 45 percent, compared to the state's overall 35 percent recycling rate as reported by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. 28 It should be noted that the City of Chicago with its reported 47 percent recycling rate contributes most heavily to the 45 percent weighted average recycling rate because of its size.  6.1.4 E  ND  M  ARKETS  In order to close the r ecycling loop, recover ed materials must be purified and incorporated by ma nufacturers into new products. Manufacturers evaluate the perfor mance and aesthetics requir ements of the products they produce when consider ing whether to use recycled raw materials in their manufacturing processes. However, because product manufacturing is the doma in of the private sector, economics invariably weighs heavily in any discussion involving consumption of recover ed materials compared to alternative virgin a nd preconsumer (ma nufacturing process scrap) materials, or wher e they choose to locate their facilities. Because end markets are focused on meeting the dema nd for the products that they ma ke, recycling is often a sideline of their businesses and a means of obtaining low-cost raw materials for manufacture. It is not a requir ement that end markets for all types and quantities of recycled materials that are collected and processed in Illinois be located in the state. This fact needs to be acknowledged when consider ing whether an end market barrier or deficiency exists. In fact, end markets for many recover ed materials are national and international in scope  they consider ma ny factors when deciding wher e to locate their product manufacturing sites, including freight costs (for deliver y of their products to market as well as bringing in raw materials), utility costs, labor cost and skill level, tax incentives, etc. Care must be taken befor e attempting to create end-markets for recyclables to ensure that the products produced will be able to compete in the marketplace against the products produced by other in-state or out-of-state fir ms. It may be better to assist an existing in-state manufacturer convert its ma nufacturing systems to use r ecycled content, or even allow recover ed materials to go to an out-of-state market, rather than introduce new excess manufacturing capacity into industries that are already be saturated. This caveat does not imply that DCEO should take a hands-off approach to recycling market development in Illinois. In fact, recover y of recyclables in the state may be the enabling factor that allows the development of ma nufacturing industries in Illinois that other wise would not be competitive if located in the state. Also, as resource substitution of recycled materials for virgin materials occurs, ther e will be a shift for some types of manufacturing from locations near vir gin raw material production sites to areas wher e materia ls are recover ed from the waste strea m. Further more, not all recycled materials go into products of high-value or that are inexpensively transported. For those cases, freight costs can be an impediment that requires local recycling market development efforts if materia ls such as organics and construction and demolition debris are to be diverted for beneficial use. In order to evaluate whether ther e is sufficient market demand for increases in recovery, R. W. Beck started by comparing existing and projected incr eases in the collection of ""Nonha zardou s Solid Wa ste Mana gement and La ndfill Capa city in Illinois  1999 Annual R epor t,"" Illinois Envir onmental Pr otection Agency, Januar y 2001. Although the overall r ecycling rates r eported in the r epor t ar e thought to be infla ted, conclusions ca n still be dra wn fr om differ ences between relative r ecycling rates. 28  6-4  R. W.

For paper, there is sufficient national and export dema nd. This is not the case, however, for other materials, such as compost, wood, electronics, and construction and demolition debris, and wea k end market dema nd for those materials can be consider ed an impediment to incr eased diversion. Many products are disposed rather than recycled because economical recla mation technologies are not commonplace, which is an obstacle  carpet recycling is an exa mple of this phenomenon. Similarly, recla mation technologies sometimes produce a recycled product that is somehow differ ent from the virgin materia l currently being utilized, which ca n be an impediment to marketing recycled materials to end product manufacturers that aren't familiar with or equipped to utilize the recycled raw materials. Finally, apparently simple or nominal cost changes to ma nufacturing practices product manufacturers can result in products that are significantly mor e difficult or recycle, or which requir e additional recla mation equipment.

This section describes some of the options that can be employed. It must be noted, however, that some of the obstacles that wer e previously identified are based on issues of cost or personal behavior. Our system of free enterprise, constitutional prohibition against the interference of interstate commerce, and international trade agreements all limit the r egulator y role of gover nment. As a result, some of the actions that will be needed to overcome barriers or impediments will be limited to incentives or assistance.  6.2.1 RECOVERY INFRASTR  UCTURE  It was previously noted that the lack of universal convenient recyclables collection programs, particularly for residents of multifa mily dwellings and at the workplace, was an obstacle to R. W. Beck, Inc. 6-5   S  ECTION  6  incr eased recover y. Further mor e, achieving higher recycling rates will requir e the targeting of additional materials for higher levels of recovery, including yard waste, construction and demolition debris, residential mixed paper, and commercially-generated paper, metals, and other discards. Some of the strategies that can utilized include: Raising community recycling goa ls; Passing or dinances for residential and business recycling programs; Implementing disposal bans on r ecyclable products; Increasing inspections and enforcement action for products banned from disposal facilities, including funding inspector positions; Providing grants or incentives/rewards to communities for increased diversion; and Conducting workshops to promote technology transfer, reduce collection costs, and learn from the successes of others.  6.2.2 BEHAVI  OR  Several strategies can be implemented to incr ease participation in recycling programs and capture more targeted r ecyclables. These strategies include: Increasing inspections and enforcement action for products banned from disposal, including funding inspector positions; Transitioning to larger-sized r ecyclables collection containers; Promoting pay-as-you-thr ow so that cost-savings occur from incr eased recycling; Implementing deposits; and Promoting recycling through education and awareness programs.  6.2.3 E  CONOMICS  Low costs for solid waste disposal can be an obstacle to increased recovery. In some jurisdictions, excess disposal capacity or facilities that are not appropriately sized to be costeffective have been per mitted and constructed. In order to meet bond covenants and pay the debt service on those facilities, some jurisdictions have subsidized part of the disposal cost through assessments or other funding mecha nisms so that tipping fees are kept artificially low in order to preserve the flow of waste into the facilities. The need for revenue tons creates an economic disincentive to establishing recycling programs, particularly for commercial sector generators of solid waste. Several things can be done to addr ess the economics of recycling compared to waste disposal, including: Establish recycling or dinances, which removes economics from the decision-ma king process; Carefully review per mits for disposal and transfer facilities; Requir e disposal facilities to operate as enterprise funds; Place surcharges on tipping fees to raise the cost of waste disposal and provide a funding source for recycling. Care must be taken when consider ing options for influencing the economics of recycling versus disposal to ensure that disposal costs aren't exorbitantly increased. Doing so could simply result in the transfer of waste out of Illinois to low-cost landfills located in neighboring states. 6-6 R. W. Beck, Inc.   FUTURE GROW 6.2.4 E ND  TH SCENARIOS  M  ARKETS  End market impediments exist for organics, construction and demolition debris, and electronics. Further mor e, although ther e are not impediments for other materials that are commonly recycled in the state (e.g., ferrous metals, nonferrous metals, newspapers), there are opportunities for DCEO to promote the growth of in-state markets for those materials so that Illinois can benefit from the economic impact of those market areas. The following types of programs can be used to bolster end markets for recyclables: Grant and loan programs that are targeted to expanding markets, particularly for problematic materials; Environmentally preferable purchasing and buy r ecycled programs; Business assistance programs for recycling enterprises, including business plan development, technical assistance, marketing assistance, relocation assistance, and links to alternative sources of fina ncing; Recycled product development assistance programs, such as grants, matching funds, or loans for product prototyping, testing, and equipment or process conversions; and Product stewardship and extended product responsibility, so that industry can mor e fully share in the ma nagement and costs of the r ecovery and recycling infrastructure, and directly benefit from design for recyclability and the envir onment.  6.3 SUMMARY OF POLICY AND PROGRAM COST, EFFECTIVENESS, AND BENEFITS R.

W. Beck, Inc.   FUTURE GROW  TH SCENARIOS  A comparison of the reported recycling/waste reduction rates in Table 6-2 to grant and loan funding on a per-capita basis did not show a strong correlation. Ther e also was no strong correlation of statewide r ecycling rates to the extent to which curbside r ecycling collection access is provided, or percent of the state's population cover ed by unit-based pricing (""pay as you throw,"" or ""PAYT"") for residential waste disposal. It is noteworthy, however, that there was a significant correlation of recycling goal levels to achieved r ecycling rates. In reality, it is likely that many progra m and policy factors work together in deter mining the level of recycling activity that is achieved, including: Level of goals; Extent of grant and loan progra m funding; Waste disposal tipping fee levels; Access to recycling collection progra ms; Landfill bans; and Extent of non-gover nmentally sponsor ed recycling programs. Further mor e, the recycling rates shown in Table 6-2 above are ""as reported"" by states and, in ma ny cases, are not comparable because of differ ences in what is included as ""recycled"" (numerator) and ""generated"" (denominator). In some cases, a diversion rate is reported. For exa mple, Wisconsin's figur es include estimates of backyard composting and other on-site reduction activities. For these reasons, correlating portions of statewide recycling rates to specific program elements and allocating costs to those recycling rates could not be done from the above data. The literature search did uncover a study that quantified the cost of achieving various recycling rates in California.29 Conclusions of that study wer e: Achieving a diversion rate of 35 percent costs approximately $5.30 per household per month; and Achieving a diversion rate of 50 percent costs approximately $7.00 per household per month. A limitation of the study is that it focused on cost data for community-sponsored recycling programs. While commercial sector recycling activities and Califor nia's bottle r edemption program contribute to diversion rates, their cost or effectiveness data were not explicitly deter mined by the study. For this reason, the per-household data may be most useful as points of refer ence, or ""reality checks,"" for this REI study.  6.3.1.2 PUBLISHED DATA FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS AND POLICIES In conducting the literature review useful infor mation was found on the cost and effectiveness of individual programs and policies, suggesting that one option for estimating the costs of reaching certain recycling rates is to sum the individual cost and diversion impacts of a collection of program/policy options. One national study surveyed a wide variety of communities in an attempt to correlate demographic and progra m data to recycling rates on the community level. 30 That study reached the following conclusions:  ""Achieving 50% R ecycling  What Will I t Cost?

Additionally, a similar study by the same author analyzed California community data and concluded:31 Expanding collection programs to multifa mily residences adds 1 to 2 percentage points of diversion; and Adding materials (such as residentia l mixed paper) adds 3 to 5 percentage points of diversion. It should be noted that the above results represent marginal changes for each program item, mea ning that the results predict projected increases in diversion rates as a result of making cha nges to each specific progra m item separately.

Because these types of progra ms are driven mor e by concer ns over the hazardous nature of certain electronics components, they tend to resemble household hazardous waste collection programs (in ter ms of program cost and diversion mechanisms) rather than traditional municipal recycling programs. Data of use to this study was drawn from two studies, one in Minnesota and one in Massachusetts.33 Those studies indicated that typical collection costs for recover ed electronics wer e $240 to $300 per ton, and processing was approximately $100 per ton. However the studies noted that pilot progra m and start-up costs had resulted in inflated costs compared to what would be expected of mature ongoing progra ms.  6.3.2 S  TATE SURVEY RESULTS  In addition to reviewing published data, R.

In conducting the survey we found that the types of grants provided by responding states differ ed considerably from state-to-state. However, virtually all states have grant programs for waste tires, used oil, or household hazardous waste, and similar grant programs could be set up for specia l wastes such as electronics. The survey revealed that no state that was contacted adequately measured grant program costeffectiveness. Many states had never for mally attempted to measure the effectiveness of their grant programs. Moreover, most had not created standardized for ms to facilitate numer ical tracking. Those who ha d gather ed data primarily focused their forms on fiscal reporting for project expense reimbursement purposes. Several states cited reasons for not being able to identify or rigorously track grant/loan program cost-effectiveness. These reasons included: Difficulties in measuring impacts associated with public education and promotion projects for recycling and waste reduction; One-time grant expenditures for infrastructure development have ongoing recover y impacts, necessitating a complex lifecycle approach to eva luating cost-effectiveness; Differ ences between grants that have a cost because they aren't repaid and loa ns that can be consider ed to be ""no cost"" because they are repaid, even though both have diversion impacts; and Undefined benefits experienced by other communities throughout the state from research, innovation, and demonstration projects that wer e funded at one location. Nebraska and Wisconsin wer e two states that had recently undertaken specific exa minations of the effectiveness of their grant programs. The following is a brief overview of Nebraska's and Wisconsin's recycling grant/loan program evaluation efforts.  6.3.2.1 STATE OF NEBRASKA GRANT/LOAN PROGRAM EVALUATION EFFORTS Nebraska commissioned a study to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of its grand and loan programs. That study concluded that, ""Information on the impacts of [Nebraska Environmental Trust's and Department of Environmental Quality's] grant projects funded to date is incomplete and/or not readily available...only limited information was available on the quantities and composition of materials diverted as a direct result of individual grant projects."" As a result, Nebraska's study focused on or ganizing grant data into a database, analyzing the types of projects funded, qua ntifying incr eased diversion (on a statewide basis) over the period of the grant program. The study also provided a methodology for quantifying the economic and environmental benefits of recycling and source reduction, including: Economic benefits for recycling and source reduction based on per-ton commodity values (recycling) and per-ton purchase cost savings (source reduction); Landfill space savings in cubic feet resulting from recycling and source reduction efforts funded by grants and loans; Forest acreage saved due to recycling and source reduction; BTUs of energy saved due to recycling and source reduction; Tons of emissions savings (atmospher ic, waste, and water-borne) from recycling and reuse; and  6-12  R.

Economic benefits for landfill space savings, for est acreage savings, energy, emissions, and gr eenhouse gas reduction are subject to widesprea d debate and wer e not quantified.  6.3.2.2 STATE OF WISCONSIN GRANT/LOAN PROGRAM EVALUATION EFFORTS Wisconsin attributes its most significant gains in its statewide recycling rate to its 1995 landfill ban on certain recyclables commonly targeted by local community recycling programs. In conjunction with this ban, Wisconsin has been providing grant funds to local governments to support their recycling program efforts. The apparent disparity in costeffectiveness a mong local gover nment programs led Wisconsin's legislature to task the State's Department of Natural Resources to ""conduct a study of the future of solid waste ma nagement, including an exa mination of ways to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of current recycling programs."" Grant funding of recycling in Wisconsin is currently set to expire at the end of fiscal year 2004 unless a new system of funding is established. The Department of Natural Resources tracks grant expenditur es and municipal diversion amounts associated with such grants. However, in its January 2001 report ""A Study of the Future of Solid Waste Management: A Report to the Wisconsin Legislature"" it stated that: ""Strong, clear relationships could not be established between solid waste cost per ton and recycling costs per ton, recycling rate and population or number of households served, recycling rate and cost per ton for recycling, tons recycled and cost per ton; or the percent DNR funding and the recycling rate."" Wisconsin's report does, however, reference statewide disposal costs of $85 per ton (collection, hauling, and tipping fees combined) compared to average r ecycling costs of $95 per ton incurred by Wisconsin communities. Further mor e, it goes on to state that these figures do not account for materials that communities no longer ha ve to collect (e.g., 290,000 tons of yard waste that's mana ged at home) or the economic value of jobs created through recycling, the significa nt value of resources saved, or pollution prevented and ener gy saved efforts. Like Nebraska, Wisconsin quantified ""quality of life impacts"" by including cubic yards of landfill space saved, Wisconsin jobs in recycling, ener gy savings, greenhouse gas emissions savings, and air pollutant reductions.  6.3.2.3 STATE GRANT/LOAN PROGRAM EVALUATION EFFORTS In the absence of compr ehensive cost-effectiveness data, a review was conducted of states that compare total grant spending over a specific period of time with commensurate incr eases in statewide recycling diversion over the baseline. Nebraska made use of this type of a statewide analysis in its grant program evaluation after grant recipient interviews perfor med by a consultant indicated that grant funding has been a catalyst for spurring growth in collection, processing, and end-use of recycled commodities. R. W. Beck also perfor med this type of an analysis from data supplied by other states, the r esults of which revealed the following: Florida expended $186 million in Recycling and Education grants from 1990 through 1998. Over that same period an incr emental 30 million tons of recover y occurred (including yard waste and construction and demolition debris), equaling $6.21 of state funds spent per ton recover ed. Local funds averaged $5 for ever y $1 of state funds over this period. Nebraska expended $30.7 went for hazardous waste, incr emental 962,500 tons spending is counted (i. e., R. W. Beck, Inc. million in total grants from 1992 through litter, tire clea n-up, waste reduction). Over wer e recycled over the baseline a mount. $22.5 million) this translates to $23 of sta 1998 ($9.2 million that same period an If only recycling te money spent per 6-13   S  ECTION  6  ton recover ed (Nebraska's figures don't include construction and demolition debris recycling or composting). Grant matching funds and loca l program spending was not available for this analysis. Pennsylvania expended $250 million in grants from 1989 through 1999. Over that same period an incr ementa l 16.4 million tons wer e recycled over the baseline amount, equaling $15.23 of state funds per ton recover ed. Although infor mation on loca l program expenditures wer e not available, most grant funding was provided thr ough Pennsylvania's Recycling Grants, which are based on 90 percent reimbursement with money ava ilable for program initiation, expansion, and public education. Significant levels of grants were also awarded under an incentive grant program that is tonnage and recycling rate based, which pays from approximately $5 to $22 per ton recover ed. Wisconsin expended $24 million in grants during 1999, resulting in 0.9 million incr emental tons recycled over 1990 levels. This equals $26.67 of state money spent per ton recover ed. These grants cover ed 30 percent of local gover nment eligible recycling and yard waste costs. It should be noted that these cost per ton figur es do not take into account future diversion likely to occur as a result of grant and loan program investment.  6.3.2.4 IMPACTS OF GRANT/LOAN DISCONTINUATION One way to measure the impact of grant funding is to exa mine what happens when grant funds are withdrawn. Table 6-4 illustrates the resulting impacts from New Jersey's and Washington's decisions to discontinue the distribution of recycling loa ns and grants. New Jersey's legislature cut off all solid waste and recycling grant fund appropriations after the state's ""Recycling Tax"" expir ed on December 31, 1996. Similarly, funding for Washington's Solid Waste Management Account expir ed in July 1995, and appropriations from that fund ceased. However, some grant funds still rema in in Washington and come out of its Toxics Control Account.

S ourc es : NJ D epartment of Envir onmental Pr otection, W ashington Depar tment of Ec ology  As shown in Table 6-4, recycling rates in both New Jersey and Washington declined by approximately five to six percent within thr ee years of the discontinuation of recycling grant programs. Not all of the decline in recycling rates can be attributed to elimination or cuts in grant programs  Washington specifically noted that after it cut its grants commodity price declines resulted in less private sector recycling activity, which prevented a true deter mination of the cost-effectiveness of its grant programs. Similar statements can be made about New Jersey's data.  6.3.2.5 TYING GRANTS TO PERFORMANCE  REWARDING EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS Rather than simply distributing entitlement grants, Massachusetts and Pennsylva nia reward municipalities for specific r ecycling achievements thr ough incentive or perfor ma nce grant programs that are based on tons of designated recyclables that are diverted (yard waste and construction and demolition debris are not designated materials in either state). These perfor mance-based programs are in addition to other solid waste and recycling grant programs offer ed by each state. Further mor e, increases in recycling amounts or rates result in a greater dollar grant award. As a result, condition for receiving these perfor mance grants is that communities must report the amounts of materials diverted in their respective jurisdictions. The State of Illinois may wish to consider developing a similar reporting system or incentive-based recycling grant/loan program to improve the State's specific data needs for measuring progr ess toward recycling goals. For communities to participate in Massachusetts' Municipal Recycling Incentive Progra m (MRIP), they must meet certain criteria that include: Buying recycled products and tracking those purchases; Showing recycling progra m progr ess; Providing for household waste collection; and Having waste reduction programs. Massachusetts also offers a ""basic tier"" MRIP as well as an ""advanced tier"" MRIP (with mor e stringent requir ements). Payments under the basic tier are $5 per ton for curbside recycling programs and $3 per ton for drop-off progra ms. Payments under the advanced tier are $10 per ton for curbside programs and $6 per ton for drop-off programs. Either program pays a ""bonus"" of $20 per ton for year-over-year tonnage increases. During the first three years of the MRIP program, payments to participating municipalities totaled nearly $7 million (approximately $0.65 per person per year), and residentia l recyclables tonnages incr eased by 20 percent. Any municipality or county can participate in Pennsylva nia's Perfor ma nce Grant Program. Recover ed materia ls must be source separated, and payment is only ma de for material that is marketed (after residue disposal). Payments include a base reward of $5 per ton, wher e the number of commer cial tons counted is limited to the number of tons recover ed through government progra ms. Bonus payments are made by multiplying the municipality's recycling rate times $1 per ton times the number of tons qualifying for the base reward. R. W. Beck, Inc. 6-15   S  ECTION  6  Finally, as an incentive for communities to support private sector recovery programs, the program pays an additional $10 per ton for private tons that exceed the public sector tons. In fiscal year 1999/2000, this specific perfor mance grant program repr esented 40 percent of recycling grants paid, and amounted to $1.21 per person.  6.3.3 CO  NCLUSIONS  Based on the literature search and survey results, it is difficult to deter mine a dollars per ton cost-effectiveness measure for specific state grant and loa n programs, education and awareness programs, or state policies. In fact, it may be impossible for a variety of reasons, including the ongoing nature of programs after initial investments are made and the role that the private sector plays in providing solid waste and r ecycling collection services to the commercial sector, which significantly affects a state's overall recycling rate. Despite these limitations, R. W. Beck was able to use specific program-based data from the literature search and survey, in combination with other R. W. Beck planning factors, in order to arrive at growth scenario cost and effectiveness estimates found in the rema inder of this report. Infor mation used from the literature search/survey includes: Implementing PAYT programs can be expected to increase diversion by ten percent with no net program cost increases; and Collection costs for electronics recycling programs average $180 per ton (assumes a onethir d discount from average published costs due to program startup costs reflected in those totals), and processing costs average $100 per ton. Further mor e, statewide aggregate dollars per ton or dollars per person figures as reported in this section served as reality checks against which totals from each scenario wer e checked.  6.4 GROWTH SCENARIOS The following thr ee specific industry growth scenarios wer e analyzed for this study: Achieving a 35 percent state recycling rate; Achieving a 50 percent state recycling rate; and Banning the disposal of electronics in Illinois landfills. In order to estimate economic impacts and scenario costs and benefits, it was necessary to ma ke certain assumptions regarding the policies and programs that would be implemented, incr eases in diversion of various materials, and whether collected materials would be retained in state for recla mation/recycled product manufacturing. Generally speaking, it was assumed that local collection/processing infrastructures and their costs/benefits will increase linearly with the growth in recycling rate. Assumptions for recycling ma nufacturing wer e more involved and requir ed an evaluation of whether the additional materials collected wer e likely to displace virgin or imported recover ed materials, or whether there wer e opportunities for manufacturing industry growth (using recover ed materials) in Illinois. Specific assumptions are spelled out under each scenario.  6.4.1 AN INCR  EASE IN THE  OVERALL REC  YCLING RATE TO  35 P  ERCENT  6.4.1.1 GROWTH SCENARIO PROGRAM ELEMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS The State of Illinois reached a 23 percent recycling rate in 1998, which subsequently grew to 27 percent in 1999 according to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. This growth  6-16  R. W. Beck, Inc.   FUTURE GROW  TH SCENARIOS  scenario is based on continuing the diversion trend until a recycling rate of 35 percent is achieved. Assumptions for achieving 35 percent generally include bolstering the effectiveness of recovery programs already in place, expanding residential r ecyclables collection, and incr easing commercial diversion. Specific program elements for the State to implement include: Increase county recycling goals to 35 percent; Increase the waste disposal tipping fee surcharge by $0.60 per ton; and Promote recycling and work for development of markets, particularly for materials such as construction and demolition debris. Specific program elements for local governments to implement include: Increase pay as you throw programs in Illinois from the current coverage of one million residents34 to four million residents (in communities offering curbside collection of recyclables); Increase single-fa mily curbside recycling collection access by one million r esidents (from 84 percent to 91 percent of single-fa mily households); Increase multifa mily on-site recycling collection access by 950,000 residents (from the current 22 percent to 50 percent of residences); Increase enforcement of the yard waste disposal ban that is already in affect though continued emphasis, inspections for complia nce, and fines for collectors/generators who fail to comply  specifically, hire 50 inspectors to perfor m these activities; Increase residential mixed paper collection from a n estimated two million residents in 1998 to four million residents; Promote additional construction and demolition debris processing for recovery; Promote additional commercial recycling programs through ordina nces, waste audits, and incentives; and Increase recycling education and awareness programs by spending an additional $0.50 per person. It is assumed that implementing these program elements will result in an overall statewide recycling rate of 35 percent.  6.4.1.2 ECONOMIC IMPACTS Table 6-5 shows the estimated economic impacts of achieving a 35 percent recycling rate, including offsets from economic activity that is lost in other sectors of the Illinois economy, such as waste collection, landfills, and rock quarries.  34  ""Unit Ba sed Pricing in the United States: A Tally of Communities,"" M.L.

W. Beck, Inc.  6-21   S  ECTION  6  In reviewing the information in Table 6-5, it must be noted that substitution of recover ed materials for virgin materials at existing Illinois manufacturers generally doesn't produce additional dir ect economic activity (i. e., new jobs, additiona l revenues, etc.). In order for economic growth to occur, either new establishments must open or existing establishments must increase their production and product sales. Because Illinois has end market dema nd that outstrips in-state supply for many materials (as shown in Table 6-4) it was assumed that materials substitution of Illinois recover ed material for imported recover ed material would occur in most recycling ma nufacturing instances. Therefore, most of the incr eases in economic activity wer e estimated to occur in loca l collection and processing. However, it was assumed that opportunities exist to expand recycling ma nufacturing in Illinois for a few select areas. Those assumptions include: Expansion of secondary smelting of nonferrous metals thr ough production increases at existing smelters and the addition of one new establishment; One vir gin-metal nonferrous product producer converts to using recover ed material; Three new paper/paperboard mills open in the state  one newsprint and two paperboard/linerboard mills; Three new other paper products manufacturers open plants in the state; Plastics reclaimers alrea dy in Illinois expand their production; One vir gin plastic converter shifts production to use recycled plastics; and Six new establishments open to recycle a variety of other recovered materials.  6.4.1.3 COSTS AND BENEFITS As was discussed in Section 6.3 ther e was no strong correlation of state government grant and loan spending levels and statewide recycling rates  much of the costs associated with specific r ecycling programs are borne by local gover nments and the private sector. However, most people agr ee that state gover nments need to provide some measure of support beyond policy-ma king so that recycling rates incr ease, at a minimum funding research and demonstration projects, providing technical resources (including wor kshops, market guides, assistance visits, or training sessions), and providing dir ect assistance to develop markets. Because ther e is disagr eement on the level of state support that is necessary to achieve higher recycling rates, it was assumed for the purposes of this analysis that a level of five percent of net progra m costs would be sufficient. This level of funding is within the range of state spending that was reported in Table 6-1 for those states that do not significantly subsidize local recycling progra ms with state funds. Estimating local gover nment costs are mor e straightforward because cost information on specific types of diversion programs is more r eadily available. In the cost analysis for achieving a 35 percent recycling rate, loca l government progra m costs wer e estimated for each of the progra m cha nges listed in Section 6.4.1.1 and adjusted for disposal cost savings at the statewide average tipping fee level ($30 per ton) so that net cost figures wer e produced. Because similar infor mation was not found for private sector diversion programs, it was assumed that incr emental private sector costs wer e an additional $5 for ever y ton diverted from disposal. Ther e are ma ny benefits to recycling, including: Disposal tip fee cost savings; Job creation and resulting tax revenues that flow to gover nments; Extending landfill life; 6-22 R. W.

Beck quantified the economic benefits of the first two items listed above. However, assigning economic benefits to the remaining items is exceedingly complex and was beyond the scope of this study; ther efore their economic effects are not included in the cost and benefit analysis of this section. Table 6-6 lists the results of the cost and benefits analysis for achieving a 35 percent recycling rate:  C  TABLE 6-6 OST-BENEFIT COMPARISON OF ACHIEVING A  35 PE  RCENT RECYCLING RATE  ALL VALUES ARE IN ARE IN $MILLIONS  Government State Local Costs Net Additional Cost to Achieve 35%1 Benefits Recycling and Reuse Industry Tax Paym ents Total Taxes Attributable to the Recycling and 2 Reuse Industry 1 2  Commercial Sector 18 0 0  Total 44 33 84  2 17 43  24 16 41  Net of avoided dispos al c os t s avings. Included taxes fr om indir ect and induc ed ec onomic ac tivity stimulated by the r ec yc ling and r eus e industr y.  In reviewing the information provided in Table 6-6, it should be noted that revenues associated with increasing the state tipping fee surcharge by $0.60 per ton are not included in the analysis because they are derived from waste disposal and are not recycling program costs or benefits. The revenues associated with the incr eased tipping fee surcharge are estimated to amount to $8 million per year, and can be used to offset the additional costs to achieve a 35 percent recycling rate. It should also be noted that all fiscal estimates are based on infor mation available at the time this study was completed. No assumptions ha ve been made for the time it may take to achieve this or the other growth scenarios, or the affects of inflation over time.  6.4.2 AN INCR  EASE IN THE  OVERALL REC  YCLING RATE TO  50 P  ERCENT  6.4.2.1 GROWTH SCENARIO PROGRAM ELEMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS This growth scenario is based on achieving a recycling rate of 50 percent. Assumptions for achieving 50 percent generally include bolstering the effectiveness of recovery programs already in place, expanding residential recyclables collection, and incr easing commer cial diversion, particularly for paper, metals, and construction and demolition debris. The specific program elements mentioned below are changes from current recover y systems, and ther efore are in place of and not additional to the program elements discussed under the 35 percent scenario. Specific program elements for the State to implement include: Increase county recycling goals to 50 percent; Requir e recycling progra ms for paper and meta ls at commer cial establishments; R. W. Beck, Inc. 6-23   S  ECTION  6  Requir e that construction and demolition debris be processed for recover y prior to disposal; Consider mandating that counties over 100,000 population must provide universal curbside/on-site residential recycling collection programs; Increase the waste disposal tipping fee surcharge by $1.20 per ton; and Promote recycling and work for development of markets, particularly for materials such as construction and demolition debris. Specific program elements for local governments to implement include: Increase pay as you throw programs in Illinois from the current coverage of one million residents35 to six million residents (in communities offering curbside collection of recyclables); Increase single-fa mily curbside recycling collection access by one million r esidents (from 84 percent to 91 percent of single-fa mily households); Increase multifa mily on-site recycling collection access by 1,800,000 residents (from the current 22 percent to 75 percent of residences); Increase residential mixed paper collection from a n estimated two million residents in 1998 to eight million residents; Strictly enforce the yard waste disposal ban that is already in affect though continued emphasis, inspections for complia nce, and fines for collectors/generators who fail to comply  specifically, hir e 100 inspectors to perfor m these activities; Requir e that all construction and demolition debris be processed for recovery prior to disposal; Requir e commercial recycling programs thr ough ordinances and provide implementation assistance thr ough waste audits and workshops; and Increase recycling education and awareness programs by spending an additional $1.00 per person. It is assumed that implementing these program elements will result in an overall statewide recycling rate of 50 percent.  6.4.2.2 ECONOMIC IMPACTS Table 6-7 shows the estimated economic impacts of achieving a 50 percent recycling rate, including offsets from economic activity that is lost in other sectors of the Illinois economy, such as waste collection, landfills, and rock quarries.  35  ""Unit Ba sed Pricing in the United States: A Tally of Communities,"" M.L.

The main report provides an additional level of detail beyond that found in this Executive Summary, and thoroughly and completely documents the methodology used in producing the study results. The goal of the study was to document the size of the recycling and reuse industry by first determining direct economic information for each of twenty-six categories of recycling and reuse establishments. The direct economic values that were measured included: Number of establishments; Employment; Annual payroll; Annual receipts; and Annual throughput (for recycling categories). Next, similar information was estimated for four categories of supporting establishments intimately involved in the recycling and reuse industry. Finally, the broader effect of recycling and reuse businesses and their employees on the economy was derived through economic modeling using direct data as inputs. This information included: Indirect economic values (inter-industry linkages as measured by purchase of intermediate commodities); Induced economic values (personal spending by employees of direct and indirect establishments); Multipliers to calculate total economic values (the sum of direct, indirect, and induced) from direct economic values; and Tax revenues attributable to the recycling and reuse industry.  INTENDED USES FOR THE STUDY Recycling and reuse businesses, like other businesses, provide a number of economic benefits, including creating jobs, making investments, and paying taxes. This study and the economic benefit information it contains may be used as a: Reference for economic development agencies, entrepreneurs, and financiers to understand and evaluate recycling and reuse businesses; Reference for lawmakers to assist them in evaluating legislation that would affect recycling and reuse; Tool for recycling advocates to increase understanding of the industry, promote awareness of recycling and reuse, and target resources for growth; and Baseline of economic information to document future growth and development of the industry.

Twenty-six recycling and reuse industry categories are used in this study and can be grouped into the following sectors based on the general types of activities undertaken: Recycling: Collection; Processing; Manufacturing; and Reuse and Remanufacturing. The recycling sector includes long-established sectors like paper and steel making, as well as new entrepreneurial ventures such as composting and plastic and rubber product manufacturers. The reuse and remanufacturing sector encompasses a diverse mix of establishments including wood reuse (e.g. pallet rebuilders, etc.), tire retreaders and electronic appliance demanufacturers.  CO  MPARISON OF INDUSTRY SECTOR SIZES  Table ES-1 presents estimates of direct economic activity for the recycling and reuse industry by sector. Detailed results for each of the twenty-six categories can be found in the main body of the report.

Insight into the nation's recycling and reuse industry can be obtained by comparing the relative sizes of groups of business categories that are related in terms of materials recycled or sector of the industry that they are in. Figures ES-1 and ES-2 graphically portray the information found in Table ES-1. As Figures ES-1 and ES-2 show, the economic size of the recycling manufacturing sector far exceeds the recycling collection, recycling processing, and reuse sectors. Throughput is amount of recovered material recycled and includes manufacturing scrap sent for recycling. It excludes materials prepared for fuel use and in-house process scrap returned to the manufacturing process. Throughput estimates are not summed to avoid triple counting at collection, processing, and manufacturing stages. 1  ES-2  R. W.

The cost in terms of labor, equipment, etc. of performing a particular process is a measure of the value that is added by that particular process. The progression in size from recycling collection to recycling processing to recycling manufacturing follows from the fact that those sectors are part of a chain where increasingly more value is added to the recovered material as it moves through the recycling chain. Initially, a relatively small amount of value is added by consolidation (collection). Processors invest significantly more expense (value) in the recovered material by sorting and densification. However, no transformation of the recovered material has yet occurred  the material has simply been concentrated. The greatest value is added in manufacturing where relatively useless raw materials of little value are made into useful products of considerable value. Reuse and remanufacturing differ slightly in that they focus on consolidation and refurbishing of products (not raw materials) that still have significant value; however, the value reuse adds cannot exceed the value inherent in a new product made from raw materials  otherwise people would buy the new product. This limits the amount of value that can be added, and thus the size of the reuse sector compared to the manufacturing sector.  CO  MPARISON OF THE RECYCLING SECTORS TO THE REUSE SECTOR  A noticeable distinction exists between the recycling sectors as a group (collection, processing, and manufacturing) and the reuse sector in terms of the size of establishments and average annual payroll. The recycling establishments have an average of 33 employees each, with an average annual payroll per employee of $36,000. Alternatively, the reuse sector is made up of smaller establishments  an average of 6 employees per establishment  with an average annual payroll of $16,000 per employee. Although the reuse and remanufacturing sector comprises 48 percent of total establishments, it makes up only 15 percent of total employees, 8 percent of payroll, and 6 percent of receipts.2 It is assumed that differences in employee pay between recycling sector and reuse sector establishments closely follow the level of skill and training required of employees. Recycling manufacturing, which contributes heavily to the overall recycling statistics, generally requires employees of higher skill and training than is normally required of employees of reuse establishments. Employees of higher skill and training are paid more than employees of lesser skill and training. It should be noted that remanufacturing jobs, which were not wellcharacterized by this study, are more likely to have similar skill and training requirements to recycling manufacturing jobs and would pay higher wages than the average reuse sector job. The difference in average employees per establishment between the recycling and reuse sectors can come from several sources, although two are most likely: (1) whether continuous production processes are employed; and (2) whether economies of scale produce improved production efficiency. Continuous production processes are normally employed to save energy, avoid production startup/shutdown inefficiencies, or cover high monthly fixed costs (such as capital equipment finance costs) by increasing daily production and revenues. Establishments that operate three shifts per day employ more persons than establishments of similar hourly production capacity that operate one shift per day. Processes where economies  These reuse and remanufacturing figures are thought to represent the minimum amount of economic activity captured by the methodology because remanufacturing activities are often included with traditional manufacturing industries that were not included in this study. Several years ago Boston University estimated remanufacturing activities on the national level (Professor Robert T. Lund, The Remanufacturing Industry: Hidden Giant, 1996). That study suggested that reuse and remanufacturing categories may be as much as three times larger than that characterized by this study's methodology.  2  ES-4  R. W. Beck, Inc.   E  XECUTIVE SUMMARY  of scale reduce unit costs apply to those instances where overhead costs are significantly streamlined or where larger-sized capital equipment is more efficient than smaller-sized equipment. Because the capital equipment and processes employed in recycling manufacturing favor continuous production and economies of scale, it is not unexpected that recycling establishments are on average larger than reuse sector establishments (which rely more heavily on manual labor).  COMPARISON OF RECYCLING CO MANUFACTURING Recycling industrial, recyclables processing  LLECTION AND PROCESSING TO RECYCLING  categories that are focused locally on recovering materials from commercial, and residential waste streams include establishments that collect and process for shipment to the recycling manufacturing industry. These local collection and establishments include:  Government staffed residential curbside collection; Privately-staffed residential curbside collection; Compost and miscellaneous organics products producers; Materials recovery facilities; and Recyclable material wholesalers. Alternatively, establishments in the recycling manufacturing sector are considered to be downstream consumers of recovered materials who rely on local collectors and processors for their supply of materials. When the two groups are compared, local collection and processing make up approximately 20 percent of total recycling employment and receipts, whereas downstream manufacturing makes up the remaining 80 percent of employment and receipts. This suggests that public policy to encourage recycling and discourage disposal, and public and private investment in local recyclables collection and processing infrastructure pays great dividends in supporting significant downstream private recycling economic activity.  L  ARGEST CONTRIBUTORS  As has been noted, the economic size of the recycling manufacturing sector greatly exceeds that of the other recycling and reuse sectors. Upon closer examination, over half of the economic activity for the entire recycling and reuse industry is accounted for by the following four recycling manufacturing sector categories: Paper, paperboard, and deinked market pulp mills, which employ 139,375 people and gross nearly $49 billion in estimated annual receipts; Steel mills, which employ 118,544 people and gross $46 billion in estimated annual receipts; Plastics converters, which employ 178,700 people and gross nearly $28 billion in estimated annual receipts; and Iron and steel foundries, which employ 126,313 people and gross over $16 billion in annual estimated receipts. These four 59 percent perspective industries manufactur categories alone account for 50 percent of all employees, 62 percent of wages, and of total receipts. Figures ES-3 and ES-4 place this information into further by showing how the size of the nation's major recyclable materials manufacturing compare to each other. As the Figures show, ferrous metals recycling ing leads the other material groups. ES-5  R. W.

When large quantities of a high-value commodity are returned to the stream of commerce, the large amount of intrinsic value returned to the economy can support more jobs and economic activity than if a lesser amount or lower value commodity is returned to the stream of commerce. Plastics and non-ferrous metals are at the top end of the value scale, ferrous metals and paper are in the middle, and glass and compost are at the low end of the value scale. Major material group recycling amounts as estimated by this study are: ES-6 R. W. Beck, Inc.

XECUTIVE SUMMARY  Yard waste  65 million tons (recycling of other organic materials is negligable);  When both amount recycled and value are considered together, the relative sizes of the various material groups can be explained. Similarly, estimates can be made of the economic impact that results from increased diversion of various materials.  T  HE RECYCLING AND REUSE INDUSTRY IN PERSPECTIVE  Figures ES-5, ES-6, and ES-7 show how the nation's recycling and reuse industry compares to other select national industries.3 These industries were chosen because they present alternatives to recycling and reuse (i.e., waste management and mining) or because they are considered to be important or preferred industries that are often targeted for support by economic developers.

It provides large numbers of jobs that, on average, pay above the average national wage. Despite the fact that more discards are disposed than recycled, it is not surprising that the recycling and reuse industry is larger than the waste management industry. This is because recycling and reuse are inherently value-adding, whereas disposal is not, and value-adding processes support jobs and economic activity. ES-8 R. W. Beck, Inc.

Economic modeling was used to help estimate the level of this additional economic activity.  E  CONOMIC ACTIVITY SUPPORTED BY INDUSTRY ESTABLISHMENTS  In addition to the economic activity of the recycling and reuse industry itself, other economic activity is supported because the industry purchases goods and services from other types of establishments (such as office supply companies, accounting firms, legal firms, building and landscape maintenance firms, etc.). Economic modeling estimated that nearly 1.4 million jobs are maintained in support businesses because of the recycling and reuse industry. These jobs have a payroll of $52 billion and produce $173 billion in receipts.  E  CONOMIC ACTIVITY SUPPORTED BY EMPLOYEES  Employees of the recycling and reuse industry (and employees in other businesses that support the industry) also support another round of economic activity when they spend their wages in the economy. Economic modeling estimated that employee personal spending supports 1.5 million jobs with a payroll of $41 billion, and produces receipts of $146 billion.  GOVERNMENT TAX REVENUES This study estimated government tax based on income levels and tax rates. and reuse industry establishments and revenues) and total revenues, which estimated by economic modeling. revenues arising from the recycling and reuse industry Table ES-2 shows the taxes paid directly by recycling their employees to various levels of government (direct includes taxes from additional economic activity as  S  UMMARY OF RECYCLING  & REU  SE  TABLE ES-2 INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTION (IN $ MILLIONS)  TO  G  OVERNMENT REVENUES Total Revenues State Local 200 800 9,900 1,000 11,900 100 600 7,800 800 9,400  Industry Sector Recycling Collection Recycling Processing Recycling Manufacturing Reuse/Remanufacturing Total  Federal 200 700 5,400 600 6,900  Direct Revenues State Local 100 400 2,600 300 3,400 100 300 2,100 200 2,600  Total 400 1,400 10,000 1,200 12,900  Federal 300 1,700 20,500 2,100 24,600  Total 600 3,200 38,200 3,900 45,800  Note: figures may not add due to rounding.  Table ES-2 shows that U.S. government revenues exceed the combined revenues collected by state and local governments as a result of the recycling and reuse industry's economic activity. Individual federal income tax payments by employees in this industry make up over 70 percent of federal tax revenues, with corporate income taxes making up about half of the remainder. State taxes primarily come from sales and individual income taxes. Local taxes come primarily from property taxes and miscellaneous fees. A conclusion that can be drawn by comparing the local government revenues in Table ES-2 to local government expenditures on recyclables collection and processing services  R. W. Beck, Inc.  ES-9   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (estimated at over $3 billion per year) is that state and federal governments experience significant revenue benefits from local government spending on recycling programs.  INFLATION IN MODELING AND TAX REVENUE TOTALS It is important to note that some of the results shown in the Other Economic Activity and Tax Revenue sections may be upwardly inflated by as much as 15 percent due to limitations inherent in the modeling process. These limitations cause problems when establishments in an industry are linked as part of a chain, as is the recycling industry. Similar problems would be seen in modeling results for any other industry that is linked in a chain. This inflation is unavoidable if modeling detail is desired for each component of an industry, as was the case for this study. Economic models estimate and attribute other economic activity to an industry based on the level of purchases that establishments and employees in that industry make. When recycling manufacturers purchase materials from suppliers, modeling estimates the economic activity of those suppliers (e.g., recyclables collectors, recyclables processors, and material reclaimers) and counts it as additional economic activity that is supported. Because the economic activity of collectors, processors, and material reclaimers has already been counted as part of the recycling and reuse industry itself, modeling in effect double-counts their economic activity. It is important to note that this bias is only found in modeling results for recycling and reuse industry sector subtotals or industry-wide totals. Also, government tax revenue subtotals and totals that are derived from modeling results show the same bias. Alternatively, economic activity and government tax revenue totals derived only from the recycling and reuse industry itself do not include bias .  SUMMARY The recycling and reuse industry is an integrated network where the public and private sectors work together to recover and transform relatively useless discards into useful products of considerable value. Returning commodities to the stream of commerce is a value-adding, job-providing, and economy-spurring activity. The recycling and reuse industry is a significant contributor to the United States economy, providing large numbers of good jobs that pay well as shown by the following statistics: n n  The average wage paid by the recycling and reuse industry is $32,700  approximately $3,000 per year more than the national average wage. 4 The recycling and reuse industry supports 3.1 percent of the paid jobs in the United States  0.9 percent through direct employment, and 2.2 percent (contributed equally) by industry and employee spending in the economy. 4 Some 2.7 percent of the US gross domestic product is attributable to the recycling and reuse industry, with 0.7 percent provided directly by the industry. 5  n  Investments at the local level in collection and processing of recyclables and public policies that favor recycling and reuse support large private sector investments in downstream processing and manufacturing.  4 5  Average wage data and total jobs data come from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, regional accounts data, regional economic profile for the U.S. for 1997 wage and salary jobs. Percentages come from dividing value added as estimated by economic modeling by gross domestic product data (national value added totals) as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, ""Gross State Product in Current Dollars, 1992-1998"" table using data for 1997.

The goal of the study was to document the size of the recycling and reuse industry by first determining direct economic information for each of twenty-six categories of recycling and reuse establishments. The direct economic values that were measured included: n n n n n  Number of establishments; Employment; Annual payroll; Annual receipts; and Annual throughput (for applicable categories).  Next, similar information was estimated for four categories of supporting establishments intimately involved in the recycling and reuse industry. Finally, the broader effect of recycling and reuse businesses and their employees on the economy was derived through economic modeling using direct data as inputs. This information included: n n n n  Indirect economic values (inter-industry linkages as measured by purchase of intermediate commodities); Induced economic values (personal spending by employees of direct and indirect establishments); Multipliers to calculate total economic values (the sum of direct, indirect, and induced) from direct economic values; and Tax revenues attributable to the recycling and reuse industry.  1.2 COMPARISON TO SIMILAR STUDIES The US REI study and reuse industry has been used in report is generally n  conforms to the methodology for gathering economic data on the recycling that was developed by the Northeast Recycling Council (NERC) and that many other state studies.

Although those existing studies quantified employment and most included other industry size estimates (such as annual sales or value-added), they used varying (and sometimes inconsistent) data collection methodologies and industry definitions. Therefore, care should be taken if attempting to compare the results of this study to previous studies. Table 1-1 lists the types of data collected in this study compared to three previous economic information studies.

W. Beck, Inc.  1-3   D 2.1 STUDY BOUNDARIES  ECTION 2 ATA CHARACTERIZATION  S  Defining the recycling and reuse industry is complex. For example, one establishment may perform a variety of processing and/or manufacturing activities, only some of which are related to recycling or reuse. So the question arises whether the establishment should be included, and if so, what portion of that establishment's activities should be attributed to recycling/reuse. In the case of product manufacturing, both recycled and non-recycled materials may be used, again raising the question whether the total activity should be included or only a partial amount. The most challenging issue that recycling economic information studies face is defining the extent of economic information to include when an industry is able to utilize recovered as well as virgin feedstock or makes an intermediate product as well as converts those intermediate products to end-products within the same facility. Consistent with the methodology developed by NERC, this study includes those activities that are most essential to the continued recycling of materials and reuse of used products.9 The study boundaries: n n  Include all ""supply side"" activities involved in recovering and preparing materials and used products for resale; Include ""demand side"" activities up to the first point at which the recovered materials or used products have successfully competed directly against their respective primary, or virgin, equivalents; Exclude the activities of non-business entities such as individuals, and of advocacy, education and other organizations which do not directly add value to recovered materials and used products, or directly support such activities; and, Exclude activities involving incineration or use of materials as fuel. Collecting materials or used products for the purposes of intermediate processing, manufacturing, and/or distribution by reuse sales establishments; Intermediate processing of recovered materials or used products including sorting, cleaning, consolidating, treating, disassembling, densifying, and/or transferring ownership for use in processing, product manufacturing, and/or for distribution by reuse sales establishments; Reclaiming of recovered materials or used products to produce refined raw materials and/or reusable products meeting the specifications of manufacturers, reuse sales establishments or other end-users; Manufacturing ""first-stage"" products containing recycled materials or used products; Operating wholesale or retail sales establishments that offer, largely or exclusively, used products prepared for reuse; and Intimately supporting the above activities through research, equipment development and sales, consulting, engineering, brokering, and exchange services.  n  n  ""Recycling and Reuse"" as defined in this study includes the following ""covered activities"": n n  n  n n n  9  NERC developed its methodology with grant funding from US EPA. US EPA also reviewed and commented on the methodology as it was under development.

""Firststage"" refers to the first product produced from recycled materials, such as a roll of paper, sheet of plastic, glass bottle or metal billet. First-stage products are often converted into finished products (e.g., envelopes, plastic bottles, or metal parts), sometimes at the same facility. Only production of first-stage products is intended to be included in this definition. At this stage, the recycled material has successfully competed against virgin material and is often indistinguishable from other first-stage products that are made from those virgin materials. This study attempted to exclude economic activity associated with further conversion within the same facility as these are essentially manufacturing rather than recycling activities.  2.2 BUSINESS CATEGORIES This report presents recycling and reuse industry data for twenty-six separate business categories. Data is also presented for four categories of support businesses. The business categories are grouped into three major sectors: n n n  Recycling Industry: includes all collection and processing of recovered materials and manufacturing using recycled materials; Reuse and Remanufacturing Industry: includes preparation of materials for reuse and remanufacturing of used or broken equipment; and Support Businesses: businesses that do not directly recycle materials or reuse products, but provide specialized equipment and services necessary to the recycling and reuse industry.  Table 2-1 briefly defines each of the 30 business categories as used in this study. For more detailed definitions, please see Appendix A.

Number of Establishments: An establishment is a single physical location where business is conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed; Employment: Consists of full and part-time employees, including salaried officers and executives of corporations; Total Annual Payroll: Includes all forms of compensation, such as salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation allowances, sick-leave pay, and the value of payments in kind (e.g., free meals and lodgings) paid during the year to all employees; Total Annual Receipts: Revenue for goods produced, distributed, or services provided, including revenue earned from premiums, commissions and fees, rents, interest, dividends, and royalties. Excludes all revenue collected for local, state, and federal taxes; and Total Throughput: Total tons of recovered materials collected or processed. This data type was not gathered for reuse and support business categories because reuse businesses typically do not track throughput data in a manner comparable to recycling businesses (e.g., they may use the number of units remanufactured rather than tons).  In deriving the direct information, five primary data types were developed: n n n  n  n  The total economic information, developed through economic modeling, generated four secondary data types: n  Indirect Economic Values: Economic activity accrued by other establishments (suppliers and customers) as a result of the activities of the recycling and reuse businesses; Induced Economic Values: Economic activity accrued by retail and other establishments because of personal purchases by recycling and reuse industry and indirect establishment employees; Multipliers: The ratio of total values (direct, indirect, and induced) to direct values; and Tax Revenues: State revenues derived from taxes, charges and fees, and miscellaneous revenues.  n  n n  2-4  R.

This section includes general descriptions of strategies for data gathering and analysis employed in the study. Notes on the specific methodology for the direct data for each category are shown in Section 4 along with the results of the study.  3.2 APPROACHES TO DIRECT DATA DEVELOPMENT In developing the direct economic information reported in Section 4, one of three methods was employed for each business category, depending on the availability and adequacy of existing information and business lists: n  Existing Data: Obtained through existing sources of information (e.g., U.S. Census Bureau's Economic Census, U.S. Geological Survey's Mineral Commodity Reports, expert opinions by industry and trade associations); Survey Data: Gathered by surveying the businesses directly and compiling the data into a database of establishments; or Derivation: Limited existing data was used to derive estimates of economic activity.  n n  The study focused on using existing data, of sufficient quality, and with categories defined consistently with the study, for as many business categories as possible to avoid duplicating efforts if sources of existing information were available. If little or no existing information was available but listings of businesses in a category were available, the next option was to develop a database of businesses and conduct surveys to obtain the desired economic information. When limited existing information was available, but no specific list of establishments could be found for purposes of surveying, estimates were derived based on limited existing data and estimations by industry experts. Due to the number of different business categories included in this study, the exact methodology used to calculate economic activity for each category was tailored to fit the material flows and processes found in each. Table 3-1 lists the business categories and the approach used for each category.

Each of the three approaches is described in greater detail in the following subsections. Furthermore, Appendix B summarizes data sources used for compiling the survey database or otherwise used for producing direct data for this study. 3-2 R. W. Beck, Inc.   M  ETHODOLOGY  After the direct economic values were developed, total economic values were estimated through economic modeling, using the direct data as inputs. In order to apply the economic model accurately, certain categories required additional information, known as intermediate inputs. To derive the total economic values, the following steps were taken: n  Survey for Intermediate Inputs  A detailed survey of a limited number of establishments was conducted to obtain estimates of the amounts of expenditures on inputs such as raw materials, chemicals, electricity, accounting services and other items necessary for production (usually expressed as a dollar amount per $1,000 in output for a particular type of industry); and Conduct Economic Modeling  A process based on an input-output approach developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Several models have been developed, including RIMS II, IMPLAN, and REMI. The model chosen for this study was the IMPLAN.  n  3.2.1 EXISTING DATA The first strategy employed was to utilize existing data from public sources or trade associations. The most common example of this strategy was the use of U.S. Census Bureau reports when a category defined in the study aligned well with a distinct census category. Reports from the U.S. Census included the 1997 Economic Census, which provides number of establishments, number of employees, payroll, and receipts for each category of establishment. Recovered material consumption by each category is also reported on the national level in those reports. Other sources of publicly available data included U. S. Geological Survey reports and reports developed by individual state governments.  3.2.1.1 RELATION OF SIC AND NAICS TO BUSINESS CATEGORIES The U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census compiles and reports a wide range of economic data on U.S. industrial activity. Up until 1997, the Census Bureau categorized businesses according to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system developed by the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget. The system classified establishments by their primary activity. Beginning in 1997, the SIC system is being phased out and replaced by the new North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). The new system harmonizes systems used in Mexico and Canada, in accordance with the North American Free Trade Agreement. Table A-1, in Appendix A, attempts to classify each business category in the study by SIC and NAICS. The codes were assigned by comparing each business category to the definitions listed in the SIC and NAICS manuals. In many cases, the listed codes also include businesses not involved in recycling and reuse.  3.2.1.2 USE OF U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, BUREAU OF CENSUS STATISTICS The primary source of U.S. Census data used for this study was the 1997 Economic Census for relevant NAICS codes, which was the most recent data available from the U.S. Census when this study was conducted. Although the Economic Census is only updated every five years, the U.S. Census updates its Standard Statistical Establishments List (SSEL) yearly, which could provide more current data than the Economic Census for future studies. It should be noted that certain data are not disclosed by U.S. Census when a NAICS a small number of associated businesses and showing exact numbers would reveal information for a particular organization. This problem generally occurs when municipal level data is presented. See Appendix C for a sample of data provided Census. R. W. Beck, Inc. code has sensitive state or by U.S.  3-3   SECTION 3 3.2.1.3 ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF EXISTING DATA Although the most commonly used existing data was the U.S. Census 1997 Economic Census, other sources provided throughput data or partial data for use in derivations or adjustments to original data. These sources of existing information and their contributions include: n n n n  American Forest & Paper Association  State and national throughput data for paper, paperboard, and deinked market pulp mills; American Plastics Council  Database provided employment and throughput data for plastics reclaimers; Steel Recycling Institute  Expert opinion on the steel recycling process and percentage of activities to include in the study; and U.S. Geological Survey  Expert opinions on the recycling of nonferrous metals and the percentage of activities to include in the study for nonferrous product producers and nonferrous foundries.  3.2.2 SURVEY DATA When little or no existing data was available for a particular business category, but lists of establishments in those categories were available , R.W. Beck conducted surveys of those businesses and performed a statistical analysis of the results to develop estimates of economic activity.  3.2.2.1 RECYCLING ECONOMIC INFORMATION STUDY DATABASE The National Recycling Coalition as part of the US REI study developed a national database of establishments as a tool for surveying businesses in categories with little or no sources of existing data. The database was compiled from various electronic databases, state directories, periodicals, and other sources. Although the database contains a number of businesses that are not in survey categories, those listings are incidental incorporations from electronic directories. Please refer to Table 3-1 for a listing of the survey categories for which the database was developed. Over 20,000 establishments were listed in the database at the conclusion of the study.  3.2.2.2 SURVEY DESIGN The survey was designed to obtain economic information from businesses in categories with little or no existing information. Appendix D contains a copy of the survey forms that were used for this study. The survey cover page confirmed the database records for establishment name, mailing information, physical location, and contact person. For organizations with more than one physical location (establishment), one cover page and survey for each physical location were completed. The survey solicited responses to the following questions: 1. Classify the establishment according to the categories defined for the study (respondents could check more than one category); 2. Identify the single category that is most representative of the recycling or reuserelated operations for the establishment; 3. Give estimations of establishment size including number of employees, total annual payroll, and total annual receipts; 3-4 R. W. Beck, Inc.   M  ETHODOLOGY  4. Estimate the percentages of labor and receipts considered covered recycling activities; and 5. Estimate the amounts, by type, of recycled materials processed. Checkboxes with associated ranges (i.e., 0-9 employees, $50,000-$149,999 total payroll) were used for questions regarding number of employees, payroll, receipts, and percentages. Due to the sensitive nature of the survey questions, it was anticipated that asking for responses in ranges rather than exact numbers would increase the response rate. With enough responses, any variation from the exact amount was likely averaged out.  3.2.2.3 SURVEY APPROACH Prior to beginning the random sample of establishments in states that did not commission state-level studies, it was estimated and budgeted that up to 600 establishments would need to be targeted for survey phone calls. Once the survey database was finalized, 6,574 establishments were listed as being in survey categories or as ""unknown."" It was determined that 627 establishments would need to be surveyed in order to acquire statistically significant data. A random sample from the 6,574 establishments listed as being in survey categories or as ""unknown"" was taken, and those 627 establishments were mailed a survey. Furthermore, at least three follow-up telephone attempts were made to establishments that failed to respond to the mailed survey in order to obtain survey information. A statistical formula was used to ensure the correct number of completions was targeted and distributed appropriately by category. The number chosen for follow-up phone calls depended on the number of completed surveys needed in each category in order to obtain statistics accurate to +/- 10 percent at a 95 percent level of confidence. This entailed randomly numbering all establishments to be surveyed. Phone calls were placed beginning with the first randomly selected business for each category and continued until all businesses in the category were called or an appropriate number of completions needed for statistical confidence was reached. Once surveys were completed, senior staff reviewed all survey data for accuracy and completeness. Responses were then entered into the REI Study database. After checking the database for errors, the raw data was compiled and analyzed using a statistical approach.  3.2.2.4 SURVEY CALCULATIONS A statistical analysis of the survey data provided by establishments that completed surveys was used to identify the recycling characteristics of the average establishment in each of the twelve survey business categories. These averages were then applied to all establishments in each survey category to estimate the number of employees10 involved in recycling activities, as well as the dollar value of recycling and reuse payroll and receipts. However, before making this extrapolation the list of non-responding establishments was examined to identify any establishments that were known to be very large, and whose economic activity would need to be estimated by some other means. The US REI Study used totals from survey categories from individual state studies and the NERC study, in combination with survey results from the random sampling of the remaining 34 states to arrive at totals for survey categories. Survey information obtained from 212 firms formed the basis of the statistical analysis for the 34 states surveyed as part of the national survey. Because many of the establishments initially included in the database were found to have been misclassified or gone out of business, it was 10  Employee responses were adjusted to a full-time equivalent basis. Thus, two employees each working 50% on recycling activities would be counted as one recycling employee.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  3-5   SECTION 3 necessary to re-estimate the number of establishments in each survey category before extrapolating average statistical data. In the 34 surveyed states, 2,370 establishments are believed to be involved in recycling activities in the twelve survey categories. The same statistical analysis was conducted in each of the state/regional studies as part of this national study. For a detailed explanation of the statistical analysis of surveys, please refer to Appendix E.  3.2.3 D  ERIVATION DATA  In the third strategy, derivations were made by using data from a variety of sources, such as trade organizations, industry experts, periodicals and other publications. Data points from various sources were pieced together to develop estimates of economic activity. As an example of this approach, a detailed explanation of the sources and methodology used for both public and private curbside collection of recyclables is given in Section 4.1, note 6 of Table 4-2. Additionally, direct data for three of the four support business categories was derived as a result of economic modeling.  3.3 INTERMEDIATE INPUT DATA FOR ECONOMIC MODELING Prior to beginning economic modeling, the 26 direct recycling and reuse business categories were evaluated to identify those categories where recycling establishments were thought to significantly differ from similar non-recycling establishments in the way they operate, their process inputs, and their purchases from other establishments in the economy. Next, existing in-house data from previous studies was examined to identify where recycling and reuse industry-specific data was lacking. For those categories lacking adequate input data, a detailed survey that asked for much greater detail regarding the cost elements of production was sent to select establishments. Those establishments that were cooperative and expressed interest in the study during the gathering of the direct economic information (employment, payroll, and revenues) were targeted for the additional surveys. Only a handful of establishments were targeted for each business category because the major process inputs and cost elements of the businesses were assumed to be very similar to each other (and quite different from the cost elements of virgin business establishments).  3.4 ECONOMIC MODELING This study modeled indirect, induced, and total economic values of 26 categories of recycling or reuse establishments using the IMPLAN11 economic model. Economic modeling started with the purchase of data files that provided a standard interindustrial accounting of the United States economy. These data files were procured from Minnesota IMPLAN Group, Inc., the data supplier for the IMPLAN model. What followed was an eight-step process to construct a model that would isolate the 26 categories of recycling and reuse establishments from other establishments in the U.S. so that their economic values could be separately analyzed and reported. The eight-step process is described below:  11  The modeling system used for this study is called IMPLAN Pro, published by the Minnesota IMPLAN Group, Inc. Data are available and may be purchased from this company for all states and all counties in the U.S. Their data standards are rigorous, their data sets are updated annually, and their methods for compiling and processing the main input-output data sets are widely considered to be a significant enhancement of the basic I-O data that are compiled and solicited by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This company has the largest user base of any of the commercial input-output models available in the U.S.  3-6  R. W. Beck, Inc.   M  ETHODOLOGY  1. U.S. standard industrial classifications were identified that best corresponded to the kind of recycling product, process, or service that each of the 26 recycling and reuse categories produces. This was necessary because there is no specific set of ""recycling and reuse"" industries in the 537 industries contained in the data files. 2. These industrial types were controlled for in the initial model while the remaining industries were aggregated to the one-digit SIC level. The initial model that was produced, then, had twenty-six specific recycling industry candidates and twelve broad industrial aggregates (e.g., farming, the remainders of manufacturing, wholesale trade, transportation, etc.). 3. The direct values obtained from the study were substituted for the direct values (also called the ""social"" accounts) in the model. Estimates of returns to proprietors, property income, and indirect tax payments to state and local governments were derived from the averages of the original industrial group. This assumed that the recycling or reuse firms yield roughly the same return on investment to sole proprietors or investors as the corresponding industry that may contain significant non-recycling establishments. 4. The remaining values in the parent category (the original values minus the recycling industry direct values) were then manually placed back into the one-digit industrial sector so that the only direct data in the sector reflected the recycling and reuse industry. This ensured the model's total amount of industrial activity summed to precisely the same value as it had originally, before isolating recycling and reuse business categories. 5. Recycling and reuse establishments differ from non-recycling and reuse establishments in the way they operate, their process inputs, and their purchases from other establishments in the economy. This step attempted to account for these differences with data from two sources: (1) the additional intermediate input data that was collected as described previously; and (2) ""in-house"" data from other previous county-level studies that were conducted in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Wisconsin counties that reflected the kinds of recycling industries measured in this study but did not contain virgin-only establishments. Twelve models were built from in-house data from counties to isolate recycling industries (primarily ferrous and nonferrous metals, plastics manufacturing, and paper industries) and their production characteristics. The production inputs in the model were then reconfigured so that the industrial linkages to raw commodities, mining, or refiners were reduced and linkages to recycling-related processors were strengthened. These changes resulted in a recalculation of all of the production input values for each recycling and reuse industry category. 6. There are several other components to input-output modeling that were investigated on the individual state levels. One modification involved changing regional purchase coefficients (RPCs) in the different state models. Adjustments were made to each state model to account for the differences and likelihood of purchasing materials in state or out of state. When looking at the U.S. as a whole, this issue has insignificant leakage effects to the results, and therefore adjustments were not necessary. In other words, it is much more likely that a state will have materials being purchased out of state, than the U.S. will have materials being purchased from another country. There were other account categories that were assessed also in the INPUT-OUTPUT model. The byproducts category in the model itemizes the commodity production by industry. Each of these categories was scrutinized and assessed as to its reasonableness for each recycling or reuse industry. No other accounts categories were altered in the models (including exports, institutional demands, or household incomes). 7. The resulting model was then re-checked for errors, omissions, and reasonableness and re-estimated in final form. This step included rebalancing the model so that the gross total equaled the original starting values. R. W. Beck, Inc. 3-7   SECTION 3 8. Once the final model was constructed, multipliers were generated for each recycling and reuse industry for Total Industrial Output, Personal Income, Value Added, and Jobs. These multipliers were applied to the original direct values to isolate each industry's unique economic contribution. In order to estimate tax revenues associated with the recycling and reuse industry's economic data (direct as well as indirect and induced), total state and local12 government revenue data were gathered from the U.S. Census Bureau's 1997 Census of Governments publications. This data included general revenue from own sources (meaning that revenues were counted only for the collecting government to avoid duplication when revenues are transferred from one level of government to another) for the fiscal year from July 1, 1996 to June 30, 1997. General revenues include: n n n  Taxes (e.g., property, sales, personal income, corporate income, fuel); Charges (e.g., higher educational tuition, hospital fees, solid waste and sewerage fees); and Other miscellaneous general revenue (e.g., interest earnings, special revenues, etc.).  Social Security and retirement taxes, as well as utility system revenues (i.e., water, electric) are not general revenues and were not included in the revenue figures. Next, data on total incomes were obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis Regional Economic Information System. Total tax revenues received by each level of government were divided by total income to yield effective tax rates for each level of government. These tax rates were then applied to the direct and total values of personal income for each business category to yield total recycling and reuse industry tax revenue estimates received by each level of government. Implicit in this method of estimating taxes is the assumption that recycling and reuse establishments are taxed at the same rates as other types of establishments.  3.5 VALIDATION OF STUDY RESULTS Upon completion of the REI study results, they were reviewed to ensure that both direct and indirect study data were valid and meaningful. The methods of review included: n n  Review of completed surveys by senior staff; and Comparisons of per-establishment and per-employee figures from the nation to similar figures from comparable state and regional studies.  Furthermore, previous reviews by state government staff and industry trade associations of the Northeast data produced by the NERC REI Study and the other state studies validated that the study methodology fairly and conservatively characterized the level of economic activity for their state or industry. 13  12 13  ""Local government"" includes counties, municipalities, townships, special districts and school districts. Similar federal government revenue data was gathered for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1996. Trade associations that reviewed the NERC study included the American Forest & Paper Association, the American Plastics Council, the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, and the Steel Recycling Institute.  3-8  R.

The section contains: n n n n  A general description of the format for the U.S. Recycling and Reuse Industry data table; The U.S. Recycling and Reuse Industry data table of results, including numbered notes that correspond to specific data points in the table and explain how the data was derived; An analysis of the results; and A discussion of the accuracy and completeness of the results.  4.1 GENERAL NOTES ON DATA TABLES This section provides general information regarding the format of the U.S. Recycling and Reuse Industry data table presented in this section. Detailed descriptions of all table column headings and an explanation of the three tiers of data presented are given here.  4.1.1 THREE-TIERED APPROACH  TO DATA PRESENTATION  Three facts about recycling and reuse businesses complicate recycling economic information studies and have led to inconsistency in past efforts: n n n  Most establishments involved in recycling and reuse are part of industries in which many establishments do not recycle or reuse recovered materials or products at all; Some establishments involved in recycling or reuse are also involved in non-recycling activities not intended to be covered in this study; and Many recycling manufacturers use less than 100 percent recycled feedstock and/or adjust the percentage of recycled feedstock throughout the year.  Past studies have handled each of these challenges differently. In an effort to exclude nonrecycling activities, some studies relied on survey respondents to estimate recycling activities. Other studies have targeted all facilities involved in recycling and did not attempt to adjust the statistics to account for non-recycling activities. Various industry and recycling experts have criticized both approaches. To overcome these challenges, the US REI Study is reporting three tiers of statistics. The goals of this approach are: n  To report statistics on recycling and reuse-related businesses as they actually exist in the economy (i.e., as part of industries and establishments that do not always involve recycling); and To derive conservative estimates for the amount of economic activity that can ""reasonably"" be attributed exclusively to recycling. The three tiers of statistics are described below.  n  4.1.1.1 TIER ONE - STATISTICS ON ALL INDUSTRY ESTABLISHMENTS Tier One statistics are reported only for certain business categories where data was available from a source that included all establishments in the category, even though some of them may not do any recycling. This information typically comes from U.S. Bureau of Census data by  W:\004016-NRC\032527-National REI\Report\National\print report\report1-4a.doc  4-1   SECTION 4 NAICS code. For example, data for all paper mills will be shown even though some of those establishments do not utilize recovered paper.  4.1.1.2 TIER TWO - STATISTICS ON ESTABLISHMENTS INVOLVED IN RECYCLING Like Tier One, Tier Two statistics are only reported for certain business categories where data was available from a source that aggregated data for recycling and non-recycling establishments. The data covers only those establishments that have some involvement in recycling, and attempts to exclude data on establishments with no recycling activities. Although all of these establishments perform some amount of recycling or reuse activity, they may also perform non-recycling activities not covered in this report. For example, information on all paper mills that utilize recovered paper would be included here, even though some of these establishments may also be involved in non-covered activities like production of wood pulp.  4.1.1.3 TIER THREE - STATISTICS ON COVERED RECYCLING ACTIVITIES Tier Three statistics are the heart of this study and are reported for all business categories. They are conservative estimates of the portion of economic activity in Tier One or Tier Two that can be reasonably attributed to the recycling activities covered in the study. Most Tier Three estimates are derived from survey results in which respondents themselves are asked to identify what percentage of their facility's activities involves ""covered activities.""14 For some important categories, including paper, plastics and metals manufacturers, an algorithm is being used to estimate covered economic activity. The algorithms begin with Tier One and Tier Two data as described above. Then, the percentage of Tier Two activity involving covered recycling activities is being estimated based on available statistics and industry expert opinions. The exact approach used for each category is documented in detail in the table notes for Table 4-2. Additionally, Tier Three statistics are reported in two columns, depending on whether the establishments in the category are ""100 percent dependent on recycling,"" or simply ""undertaking recycling activities."" Those establishments that are dependent on recycling generally have 100 percent of employment and revenues derived from recycling activities, while those that are ""undertaking recycling activities"" have only a portion of economic activity derived from recycling. This distinction is intended to assist in accurately and conservatively reporting overall results and to further illuminate the actual structure of the recycling industry.  4.1.2 D  EFINITIONS OF COLUMN HEADINGS IN THE DATA T ABLES  For Table 4-2, the lettered column headings are defined as follows: A. Business Category  for a detailed list of business category definitions, refer to Appendix A. B.

Total Statistics on Establishments Undertaking Some Recycling or Reuse Activities  a subset of Column C and reports statistics on only those establishments with some portion of operations in covered recycling activities. Establishments in this column may have all of their operations or only a portion of their operations involved in covered recycling activities. This column excludes any virgin-only establishments that may be shown in Column C. E. Statistics on Establishments Undertaking Recycling or Reuse Activities  a subset of Column D and focuses on the employment, payroll, and receipts figures in establishments with less than 100 percent of operations involved in recycling or reuse-related activities. The same establishments are considered in columns D and E. The employment, payroll, and receipts figures are adjusted to eliminate employees who are focused on virgin material preparation, and further discounted for other non-covered activities. F. Statistics on Establishments 100% Recycling or Reuse-Dependent  estimates for establishments with 100 percent of operations dependent on recycling or reuse, which in most cases establishments consume no virgin material. 17 This column presents data that is discounted for non-covered activities. G. Estimates of Total Recycling-Related Economic Activity  conservative estimates of total recycling or reuse-related economic activity. These estimates were developed by adding Columns E and F.  4.1.3 A  BBREVIATIONS USED IN DATA TABLES  Table 4-1 presents a list of abbreviations used in the data table.

Although the industry overall performs recycling or reuse-related activities, it may include some establishments with no recycling or reuse-related activities. 2 Covered activities is defined as all activities that support:  Transforming pre-consumer materials or post-consumer products into a recycled material;  Transforming recycled materials into a first intermediate product (e.g. sheet, fiber, roll);  Transforming recycled materials directly into a finished product;  Preparing used products for reuse; and  Manufacturing equipment for the recycling or reuse industries. Covered activities do not include converting a first intermediate product to finished or semi-finished products or preparing materials for fuel use. 3 Statistics are for establishments with some amount of covered recycling activities. Establishments may perform both non-recycling and recycling activities. 4 These estimates include activities where virgin and recycled feedstock materials are co-processed. The estimates do not include virgin-only feedstock material preparation activities and further conversion of intermediate products to finished or semi-finished goods. 5 Statistics on establishments where 100 percent of labor and receipts are dependent on recycling or reuse-related activities. The estimates do not include virginonly feedstock material preparation activities and further conversion of intermediate products to finished or semi-finished goods. 6 The data for Category 1, Government Staffed Residential Curbside Collection, was derived through an algorithm based on data points from a variety of sources.

For Category 2, Data Label D is ""Percent of Homes Collected by Private Sector."" 9 Throughput is derived by subtracting the Government Staffed Curbside Collection tonnage estimate from the sum of processing estimates for Compost and Organics Producers, Materials Recovery Facilities, and Recyclable Material Wholesalers. 10 Number of establishments for all survey categories is based on the REI study database. 11 Unless otherwise noted, number of employees, payroll, and receipts for all survey categories is based on summing the results of separate statistical analyses of survey results conducted for the ten Northeast states, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio, and the remaining 36 states as a group. Throughput is based on multiplying a national per-establishment average for all surveyed establishments times total establishments in the category. See Section 3.2.2 for a detailed description of survey design and calculations. The number of completed surveys on which results are based is given as ""n.""  4-8  R. W. Beck, Inc.   STUDY RESULTS 12 Surveys focused on active processing of organic materials for beneficial use. As a result, number of establishments, potential economic activity, and throughput associated with inactive composting techniques (i.e., allowing materials to slowly and independently decompose over time) may not be fully reflected in totals. Throughput for this category is based on summing throughput amounts from each of the individual state and regional studies listed in Note 11. 13 Data obtained from the U.S. Census, 1997 Economic Census. Unless otherwise noted, throughput comes from scrap materials consumption as reported by Census. See Section 3.2.1.2 for a detailed description of the use of Census Bureau statistics. 14 Data are taken from U.S. Census, 1997 Economic Census for NAICS code 421930  Recyclable Material Wholesalers. This category is defined as 100 percent recycling-related and includes a number of different types of businesses including scrap metal dealers, paper stock dealers, C&D processors, beneficiation facilities, crumb rubber producers, textile processors, and brokers. Brokerage economic activity was subtracted from the Census figures and is accounted for under indirect support to the recycling and reuse industry. 15 Throughput for Recyclable Material Wholesalers is derived by summing national recycling data as provided by several national trade associations, USGS, and U.S. Census and subtracting MRF throughput. 16 Number of establishments and throughput are taken from Column D with no adjustments. Employment, annual payroll, and estimated receipts are derived from Column D with an adjustment for the percent of covered activities (90 percent). 17 Throughput is from the Glass Packaging Institute for 1997. 18 Throughput for Nonferrous Smelting and Refining is estimated based on national scrap consumption for smelting and refining mills from the 1997 Economic Census supplemented by information from the USGS' publication Minerals Information  1997, Recycling  Metals. 19 Employment, payroll, and receipts are derived from Column D with an adjustment for the percent of covered activities (95 percent). Number of establishments and throughput are from Column D with no adjustment. 20 Data are derived by multiplying Column C figures by 50 percent, the percentage of establishments assumed to be utilizing scrap or recycled materials, based on comments from USGS nonferrous metals specialists. 21 Throughput for Nonferrous Foundries is estimated based on scrap purchases reported in the 1997 Economic Census. Total tons of scrap for the U.S. is calculated as : Total Scrap Cost (by NAICS code) / ($0.45/lb for aluminum or $0.72/lb. for copper) / (2,000 lbs/ton). 22 Estimate of establishments is based on information on mills that consume recovered paper from AF&PA's Paper Matcher. Estimates of employees, payroll, receipts are derived from Column C using the ratio of mills that consume recovered paper to all mills. Throughput is taken from the AF&PA Annual Statistical Summary Recovered Paper Utilization (April, 1999). Throughput numbers used are for 1997 to coincide with the data from the 1997 Economic Census. 23 Estimates of employees, payroll, and receipts are derived from Column D with an adjustment for the percent of covered activities (70 percent for Column E, 95 percent for Column F). The split between Columns E and F comes from an AF&PA estimate that 45 percent of mills are dependent on recovered paper. 24 Throughput is taken from the AF&PA Annual Statistical Summary Recovered Paper Utilization (April, 1999) for 1997. 25 For Plastics Reclaimers establishments, employees, and throughput are based on the American Plastics Council Handler & Reclaimer database developed by R.W. Beck. Payroll is calculated by multiplying employment figures by Census Bureau's 1997 average wage for plastics industry employees ($28,746). Estimated receipts is calculated by multiplying throughput of recycled resins produced times an average of recycled resin prices from Plastics News. Throughput is from the American Plastics Council's Plastics Recycling Rate Study as compiled by R. W. Beck, with additions for pre-consumer plastics recycled. 26 Establishments, employees, payroll, and receipts in Column C for Plastics Converters are obtained from the Society of the Plastics Industry's Economic Report 2000 for plastics converters (NAICS codes 325991 and 3261) plus additional estimates for captive plastics converting operations by establishments classified in other non-plastics industries. 27 Number of establishments, employees, payroll, and estimated receipts in Column D are derived by multiplying Column C figures by the industry-wide recycledcontent percentage (5.7 percent) divided by the average recycled content of products that contain recycled materials (35 percent). 28 Throughput is from the American Plastics Council's Plastics Recycling Rate Study as compiled by R. W. Beck, with additions for pre-consumer plastics recycled.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  4-9   SECTION 4 29 Number of establishments and throughput are directly from Column D. Employees, payroll, and receipts are derived from Column D by multiplying by the estimated percent of employees at recycling-related establishments that are involved in covered recycling-related activities (80 percent). 30 Throughput is taken from 2000 data provided by the Scrap Tire Management Council on the number of tires recycled into crumb and punched/stamped products times an average tire weight. 31 Establishments, employees, payroll, and receipts are derived from Column C by subtracting the economic activity of non-integrated mills (NAICS 3311114), which do not make steel. Throughput is taken directly from Column C with no adjustments. 32 Employment, payroll, and receipts are equal to estimates from Column D multiplied by 95 percent (5 percent deduction to account for downstream conversion). Based on comments from the Steel Recycling Institute, 100 percent of steel mills are dependent on recovered steel to make new steel, utilizing anywhere from 15 percent-100 percent recovered steel. Therefore, the only deduction taken is to account for non-covered activities. Establishments and throughput are from Column D with no adjustment. 33 For Iron and Steel Foundries, estimates for Column D are taken directly from U.S. Census with no adjustments. The Steel Recycling Institute states that all foundries as a matter of practice utilize a significant percentage of scrap in the making of new iron products.  4-10  R. W.

Figures 4-1 and 4-2 graphically portray the recycling and reuse industry by industry sector. As Figures 4-1 and 4-2 show, the economic size of the recycling manufacturing sector far exceeds the recycling collection, recycling processing, and reuse sectors.  FIGURE 4-1 EMPLOYMENT BY INDUSTRY SECTOR 800,000 700,000 600,000 500,000 400,000 300,000 200,000 100,000 0 Collection Processing Manufacturing Reuse  R. W. Beck, Inc.

Sales revenues, in turn, are used to employ persons and pay their wages, make payments on equipment, provide a return to owners and investors, and pay upstream supplier establishments for the value of their goods or services. The cost in terms of labor, equipment, etc. of performing a particular process is a measure of the value that is added by that particular process. The progression in size from recycling collection to recycling processing to recycling manufacturing follows from the fact that those sectors are part of a chain where increasingly more value is added to the recovered material as it moves through the recycling chain. Initially, a relatively small amount of value is added by consolidation (collection). Processors invest significantly more expense (value) in the recovered material by sorting and densification. However, no transformation of the recovered material has yet occurred  the material has simply been concentrated. The greatest value is added in manufacturing where relatively useless raw materials of little value are made into useful products of high value. Reuse and remanufacturing differ slightly in that they focus on consolidation and refurbishing of products (not raw materials) that still have significant value; however, the value reuse adds cannot exceed the value inherent in a new product made from raw materials  otherwise people would buy the new product. This limits the amount of value that can be added, and thus the size of the reuse sector compared to the manufacturing sector.  4.2.1 C  OMPARISON OF THE RECYCLING SECTORS TO THE REUSE SECTOR  Table 4-3 shows a noticeable distinction exists between the recycling sectors as a group (collection, processing, and manufacturing) and the reuse sector in terms of the size of establishments and average annual payroll. The recycling establishments have an average of 33 employees each, with an average annual payroll per employee of $36,000. Alternatively, the reuse sector is made up of smaller establishments  an average of 6 employees per establishment  with an average annual payroll of $16,000 per employee. Although the reuse 4-14 R. W. Beck, Inc.  Recycling   STUDY RESULTS and remanufacturing sector comprises 48 percent of total establishments, it makes up only 15 percent of total employees, 8 percent of payroll, and 6 percent of receipts.18 It is assumed that differences in employee pay between recycling sector and reuse sector establishments closely follow the level of skill and training required of employees. Recycling manufacturing, which contributes heavily to the overall recycling statistics, generally requires employees of higher skill and training than is normally required of employees of reuse establishments. Employees of higher skill and training are paid more than employees of lesser skill and training. It should be noted that remanufacturing jobs, which were not wellcharacterized by this study, are more likely to have similar skill and training requirements to recycling manufacturing jobs and would pay higher wages than the average reuse sector job. The difference in average employees per establishment between the recycling and reuse sectors can come from several sources, although two are most likely: (1) whether continuous production processes are employed; and (2) whether economies of scale produce improved production efficiency. Continuous production processes are normally employed to save energy, avoid production startup/shutdown inefficiencies, or cover high monthly fixed costs (such as capital equipment finance costs) by increasing daily production and revenues. Establishments that operate three shifts per day employ more persons than establishments of similar hourly production capacity that operate one shift per day. Processes where economies of scale reduce unit costs apply to those instances where overhead costs are significantly streamlined or where larger-sized capital equipment is more efficient than smaller-sized equipment. Because the capital equipment and processes employed in recycling manufacturing favor continuous production and economies of scale, it is not unexpected that recycling establishments are on average larger than reuse sector establishments (which rely more heavily on manual labor).  4.2.2 COMPARISON MANUFACTURING Recycling industrial, recyclables processing n n n n n  OF RECYCLING COLLECTION AND PROCESSING TO RECYCLING  categories that are focused locally on recovering materials from commercial, and residential waste streams include establishments that collect and process for shipment to the recycling manufacturing industry. These local collection and establishments include:  Government staffed residential curbside collection; Privately-staffed residential curbside collection; Compost and miscellaneous organics products producers; Materials recovery facilities; and Recyclable material wholesalers.  Alternatively, establishments in the recycling manufacturing sector are considered to be downstream consumers of recovered materials who rely on local collectors and processors for their supply of materials. When the two groups are compared, local collection and processing make up approximately 20 percent of total recycling employment and receipts, whereas downstream manufacturing makes up the remaining 80 percent of employment and receipts. This suggests that public policy to encourage recycling and discourage disposal, and public 18  These reuse and remanufacturing figures are thought to represent the minimum amount of economic activity captured by the methodology because remanufacturing activities are often included with traditional manufacturing industries that were not included in this study. Several years ago Boston University estimated remanufacturing activities on the national level (Professor Robert T. Lund, The Remanufacturing Industry: Hidden Giant, 1996). That study suggested that reuse and remanufacturing categories may be as much as three times larger than that characterized by this study's methodology.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  4-15   SECTION 4 and private investment in local recyclables collection and processing infrastructure pays great dividends in supporting significant downstream private recycling economic activity.  4.2.3 LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS As has been noted, the economic size of the recycling manufacturing sector greatly exceeds that of the other recycling and reuse sectors. Upon closer examination, over half of the economic activity for the entire recycling and reuse industry is accounted for by the following four recycling manufacturing sector categories: n n n n  Paper, paperboard, and deinked market pulp mills, which employ 139,375 people and gross nearly $49 billion in estimated annual receipts; Steel mills, which employ 118,544 people and gross $46 billion in estimated annual receipts; Plastics converters, which employ 178,700 people and gross nearly $28 billion in estimated annual receipts; and Iron and steel foundries, which employ 126,313 people and gross over $16 billion in annual estimated receipts.  These four categories alone account for 50 percent of all employees, 62 percent of wages, and 59 percent of total receipts. Figures 4-3 and 4-4 place this information into further perspective by showing how the size of the nation's major recyclable materials manufacturing industries compare to each other. As the Figures show, ferrous metals recycling manufacturing leads the other material groups.

When large quantities of a high-value commodity are returned to the stream of commerce, the large amount of intrinsic value returned to the economy can support more jobs and economic activity than if a lesser amount or lower value commodity is returned to the economy. Plastics and non-ferrous metals are at the top end of the value scale, ferrous metals and paper are in the middle, and glass and compost are at the low end of the value scale. Major material group recycling amounts as estimated by this study are: n n n n n n  Yard waste  65 million tons (recycling of other organic materials is negligable); Glass  3 million tons; Nonferrous metals  7 million tons; Plastics  3 million tons; Paper  37 million tons; and Ferrous metals  59 million tons.  When both amount recycled and value are considered together, the relative sizes of the various material groups can be explained. Similarly, estimates can be made of the economic impact that results from increased diversion of various materials.  4.2.4 THE RECYCLING  AND REUSE INDUSTRY IN PERSPECTIVE  Figures 4-5, 4-6, and 4-7 show how the nation's recycling and reuse industry compares to other select national industries.19 These industries were chosen because they present alternatives to recycling and reuse (i.e., waste management and mining) or because they are 19  Comparative industry information comes from the 1997 Economic Census (U.S. Census Bureau) for the following industries: waste management  NAICS 562 waste management and remediation services minus 56292 materials recovery facilities; auto and truck manufacturing  NAICS 336 transportation equipment manufacturing; insurance  NAICS 524 insurance carriers and related activities; mining  NAICS 21; food manufacturing  NAICS 311; machinery manufacturing  NAICS 333.

It provides large numbers of jobs that, on average, pay above the average national wage. Despite the fact that more discards are disposed than recycled, it is not surprising that the recycling and reuse industry is larger than the waste management industry. This is because recycling and reuse are inherently value-adding, whereas disposal is not, and value-adding processes support jobs and economic activity.  4.3 ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF RESULTS The results of this study for the categories identified are thought to be realistic and generally conservative. The results for categories which used existing U.S. Census data are believed to be the most accurate, followed by data for survey categories, while the derivations are likely to be the least accurate because of the limited amount of available data for estimations. Census data, although updated yearly, lags in publication by three years so that data is not as current as data for survey categories. Survey data is current; however, confidence intervals for total employment, payroll, and receipts for certain categories are quite large because of the small number of establishments in those categories. The study did encounter a number of limitations that impacted the ability to accurately capture all recycling and reuse activity. The limitations of the study include: n n  Survey data asked for intervals rather than discrete numbers; Certain business categories that could be considered part of the recycling and reuse industry were excluded because data were not available. Most notable is equipment remanufacturers, for which only a one-time national-level study was conducted, and for which lists of contact information are not maintained. In other cases, such as repair shops, there is significant debate on the types of repair activities that should be counted (e.g., automobile repair establishments). Many establishments in rapidly growing recycling and reuse sectors, or those that were recycling non-traditional materials (such as fluorescent lamps and carpets) may not have 4-19  n  R. W. Beck, Inc.  Computer  Payroll Receipts   SECTION 4 been fully listed in recycling directories, and thus their activity may be underrepresented in the overall results. n  Some derivations, such as that for plastics converters, are based on the best of several less-than-desirable options available; it is very difficult to assess the accuracy of those results.  Although the study was not able to capture every possible type of recycling and reuse activity, it is reasonably accurate for the categories shown and conservatively estimates the total amount of recycling and reuse activity taking place.  4.4 INDIVIDUAL STATE RESULTS Several states conducted REI studies in conjunction with this national study or the Northeast Recycling Council Study, or independently using the same standardized REI methodology used for those studies. Therefore, the results for those states are generally comparable to each other and the national totals found in this report. The overall results for California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Vermont are compared in this section. Detailed business category by business category figures and notes for each state can be found in Appendix F. Before comparing the state data, however, differences between those studies (such as year for which data were obtained) should be noted.  4.4.1 D n n  IFFERENCES IN  REI STUDIES  Differences in REI studies can generally be traced to two areas: Existing data source changes; Methodological changes between studies.  4.4.1.1 EXISTING DATA SOURCE CHANGES As was discussed in Section 3.2, the SIC system is being eliminated and replaced with the NAICS system. NAICS data was not yet available for the NERC (Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont), Florida, Nebraska, Indiana or Ohio studies when their data was compiled, so 1996 Census SIC data was used. However, 1997 Census NAICS data became available in time to be used for the national, California, and Illinois studies. Apart from the one-year difference in the data and the effect of inflation on fiscal values, the change over between systems caused some differences in the way certain Census categories were defined, and thus the source data used for certain recycling and reuse business categories. NAICS most notable advantage over the SIC system is that it breaks industries down into sub-components that SIC did not, thus showing more detail. To illustrate this point, take the iron and steel mill industry for example. NAICS subdivides iron and steel mills into four sub-components  fully integrated, partially integrated with a blast furnace, partially integrated without a blast furnace, and non-integrated. NAICS detail revealed that nonintegrated mills, which do not recycle steel scrap but instead convert steel intermediates made by other steel mills into products, had been included by Census in SIC data. These establishments were outside the boundary of the definition for the recycling and reuse industry. The fact that these conversion mills were included under the original SIC code was not apparent from the original SIC definition and data for them were included in the original NERC study. Data from non-integrated mills were excluded from all other state studies and this US REI study. 4-20 R. W. Beck, Inc.   S  TUDY RESULTS  It is important to note that non-integrated steel mills are much smaller than integrated steel mills that recycle steel. Although these non-integrated mills represent 64 percent of the number of ""steel mill"" establishments, they represent less than 15 percent of employment, payroll, and receipts reported by Census. It should be noted that employment, payroll and receipts are typically much better measures of economic contribution than number of establishments, and the bottom-line impact of including non-integrated mills affected the overall NERC study results by less than 4 percent for these measures. A similar problem was experienced for the tire retreaders category, which included more establishments in the SIC code than were included when reclassified under NAICS system. Because the tire retreader category is small compared to all the other categories (generally less than one percent of the total for the total recycling and reuse industry), this difference is not thought to significantly affect the overall bottom-line results.  4.4.1.2 METHODOLOGICAL CHANGES BETWEEN STUDIES There were some minor changes in methodology among the various REI studies. Census NAICS data for glass container manufacturers were used for the California, Illinois, and national studies. Surveys of glass container manufacturers were conducted for all the other state studies because with few exceptions there are too few glass container manufacturers in a state for Census to be able to report that information without disclosing individual company data. Surveys therefore are necessary to obtain the data for nearly all state studies (in order to avoid disclosure of survey data, the glass container manufacturing survey data was added to other disclosure category data and reflected in bottom-line totals). A second methodology change was the way in which economic activity for brokers of recyclable commodities was treated. At the state-level, data were not separately available for brokers, so estimates were made using the economic model and those estimates were recorded as a support business category. While completing the national study, it was found that data were available for recyclable commodities brokerages at the national level. Furthermore, it was found that the economic activity for brokers of recyclable commodities is already included under the recyclable material wholesaler category, although the definition for that category did not indicate so (this was not known while the state studies were completed). Therefore, the broker break-out in previously published state studies should be disregarded and considered to have been already accrued under the recyclable material wholesaler category. Because the broker estimates were subtracted from the other indirect establishments category to show their break-out, their economic activity was not doublecounted. It is thought that the broker activity found in the model is related to mortgage, financial instrument, and securities brokerage activities.  4.4.2 CO  MPARISON OF  REI S  TUDY RESULTS  One important conclusion to draw from the series of REI studies is that the recycling and reuse industry is not monolithic, but does display variations between states and regions, particularly in the size of establishments. The Compost and miscellaneous organics producer category exemplifies this point. Compost sites are distinctly larger, in terms of number of employees per establishment, payroll, and receipts in other parts of the country than in the Northeast. It is thought that climate and seasonal differences may play a role in the differences, as there is little yard waste to compost in northern states during the winter. Figures are much more consistent if comparisons are made on a per-employee basis, although differences are still evident between states and regions of the country. Differences between specific companies in somewhat generally defined categories can also impact comparisons. The glass product producers category illustrated this when perestablishment data from the national study were compared to similar data for the NERC R. W. Beck, Inc. 4-21   S  ECTION  4  study. Further investigation revealed that very few fiberglass establishments (which are very large compared to other establishments in the glass product producers category) are found in the Northeast compared to the rest of the country, contributing to the difference. Considering the caveats discussed above, comparisons were made between states as shown in Figures 4-6 and 4-7. Figure 4-6 shows actual recycling/reuse employment numbers on the left, as well as normalized recycling/reuse employment (on a per 100,000 state population basis) on the right. As the figure shows, Ohio has the most recycling and reuse employees in actual numbers, followed closely by California, which has three times the population of Ohio. When employment data is normalized for population differences, Indiana has the most recycling and reuse employees per capita. The State of Iowa recently completed a statewide study to measure the economic impacts of Iowa's recycling industry (Economic Impacts of Recycling in Iowa, Recycle Iowa, August 2001). Iowa's estimated direct recycling employment was 11,478, or 383 per 100,000 population; however, it is important to note that Iowa's figures do not include employment estimates for the collection and reuse sectors.

It is informative to note that normalized recycling collection, recycling processing, and reuse sectors are fairly close in each state  it is recycling manufacturing that sets states apart. This is particularly apparent in traditional industrial states such as Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania. These three states are the top three states in the nation in terms of the absolute size of their steel mill and nonferrous recycled metals industrial sectors. They also rank very high in terms of other material sectors, as shown in Table 4-4. The recycling manufacturing sector in Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania has a demand for more recovered materials than those three states recover  4-22 R. W.

Further calculations were made to estimate government revenues that would be associated with the levels of economic activity that were identified through the modeling process. This section provides an overview of the process of input-output modeling, its strengths, its limitations, and its adaptation to this study. This section also defines the terms used and what the model output data represents. The following section provides the results in tabular form.  5.1.1 I  NPUT  -OUTPUT M  ODELING PROCESS AND L IMITATIONS  Economic values or economic effects studies are usually conducted with input-output (I-O) econometric models. Input-output modeling allows researchers to investigate the interdependencies that industries, institutions, and households have with each other in a defined region of study. I-O models, therefore, relate the products made within a region and the products consumed by industries and households in that same region. At a basic level, any industry's or institution's output (usually its gross sales) requires employees, materials, utilities, capital investments, financing, maintenance, equipment, and service inputs. The probability that a firm purchases its inputs locally (meaning from within the region being modeled) is estimated in the I-O model. This probability is high when considering the United States as a region, and much smaller if the region is a particular state or county. Estimates of an industry's inputs mix and whether those inputs are purchased within the region being modeled are based on national and regional industrial surveys. Industries that fall within general industrial categories normally have very similar industrial input characteristics. A plastics firm that produces finished goods from recycled stock will be configured very similarly to a plastics firm that produces goods primarily from virgin inputs. Except for the source of their commodity input into production and the physical configuration of their processing machinery, their overall remaining operational characteristics  transportation, utilities, services, maintenance, financial inputs, etc.  are likely to be very similar. Consequently, in most instances, production characteristics of existing firms provided a very good first pass at identifying linkages and supply chains of goods and services required for production. Although the I-O model has information on up to 537 industries, there is no specific set of ""recycling and reuse"" industries. Consequently, the models that were produced were significantly modified to accept recycling and reuse industries distinctly. As was discussed previously in the Study Methodology section, this study performed limited surveys to obtain additional intermediate input data. This data, in combination with in-house data from previous county-level and state-level modeling projects, further improved the quality of the model that was produced. Limits in these types of models include: n  Difficulties in capturing economies of scale, particularly for industries with relatively small numbers of establishments where establishment-to-establishment variation may be significant (the current input values or production functions are, therefore, initially constant); An inability to identify input substitutes  especially in new technologies or in instances where input modes have changed;  n  \\orlfile\sw\004016-NRC\032527-National REI\Report\National\print report\report5.doc  5-1   SECTION 5 n n  Dated data on industrial performance and purchases, particularly for industries that are newly-emerging or rapidly changing; and An implicit assumption that input commodity supply is infinite and perfectly elastic.  I-O models, therefore, are just that  models  that simulate industrial interdependencies in the economy under study. I-O models are not necessarily good models for forecasting because they model the existing economy, and do not forecast the net impact of replacing a virgin-commodity establishment with a recycled-commodity establishment, for example. I-O models, therefore, have limits. Nevertheless, I-O models are comparably much less expensive to produce than more involved models, and do an excellent job of estimating the role a particular industry (such as the recycling industry) has on the economy. The generic term ""economic impact"" often suffers from misapplication. There are several kinds of economic transactions that may occur. For example: n n n  Firms may produce goods or provide services for export, attracting outside funds that support employment, industrial purchases, and household spending. Firms may substitute locally produced commodity inputs for those that previously were imported. In this case funds are retained in the region rather than exported. Firms may produce goods and services for local consumption (either by industries or by households). Although they may help to retain funds in the region, they may not cause significant additional economic activity.  I-O models identify the overall size and contribution of an industry  its economic effect or economic value  to the area mix of economic activity along with interdependencies that exist between it and other firms or service suppliers. In other words, the strength of linkages that exist among industries and the overall value (output, incomes, and jobs) of their production. The impact of an industry hasn't yet been determined. In the case of firms that produce finished goods for export, there is a measurable economic impact  were it not for the external demand for the locally-produced product, the economic activity would not be in the economy. A much harder measure of potential economic impact falls into the category of import substitution. If a region is able to develop industries that produce a good that substitutes for a good that is imported, then that industry is retaining dollars that used to be exported. An industry that produces a good using recycled feedstock that is supplied locally will create a product that substitutes local inputs for non-local inputs. Recycling industries often fit into the import substitution category, particularly in states without virgin feedstock production infrastructures. By utilizing recycled content, they are purchasing locally and, therefore, stimulating indigenous economic activity. This study generally reserves the use of the term economic impact only for industries that have verifiable levels of exports  where the output that they are producing is a genuine and real increase in industrial output  or for true import substitutes. To claim economic impacts over and above those just mentioned would involve much more extensive industrial measures for each category of establishments that was assessed in this study, and over a period of time. This study does, however, isolate total economic values  estimates, by category, of the value of economic interrelationships that exist for the industries. These values are the intrinsic worth of a set of industrial activities to the nation. They represent a slice of the economic pie from a particular point of view. In summary, economic models are and only can be estimates of inter-industrial linkages and regional values. They are based on an amalgam of federal, county, and state data, academic procedures, along with some survey-derived direct data, all compiled with due diligence for accuracy and reasonableness. Consequently, although an inter-industrial accounting 5-2 R. W. Beck, Inc.   INDIRECT  AND INDUCED ECONOMIC INFORMATION  framework is implied, all estimates are simulations of economic values based on the data employed and the assumptions implicit in the modeling.  5.1.2 K  INDS OF ECONOMIC INFORMATION PRODUCED BY  I-O MODELS  Input-output models produce many kinds of data for analysis and decision making. The more useful results for industrial leaders, planners, and policy makers are estimates of (1) total industrial output, (2) personal income, (3) value added, and (4) jobs. These are the categories of economic activity that are reported in detail in the data tables that follow this section. These terms are defined below: n  Total industrial output for most private industries is simply gross sales. For public or quasi-public institutions this normally includes all public outlays, along with the value of government sales and other subsidies received, to isolate the current economic value of their output to the citizens or the area served. Personal income includes the wages and salaries of employees and proprietors, normal profits to sole proprietors, and an estimate of the cash value of all benefits (e.g., social insurance, retirement, and medical benefits). Value added is a measure of gross regional product. It includes all personal income (employment compensation, incomes to sole proprietors) plus property incomes (dividends, interests, and rents), and indirect tax payments (primarily excise and sales taxes paid by individuals to businesses). Jobs is the number of full- and part-time positions in the economy, not the number of full-time-equivalents. 21 This distinction is important because the relationship between job growth and labor force growth is very different in different industries. Some industries rely heavily on semi-skilled part-time labor. Others generally only produce full-time skilled jobs. It is always important, when possible, to quantitatively assess whether the jobs that are stimulated are part-time or full-time or higher-paying versus lower-paying. Direct effects refer to the operational characteristics of the firms or institutions that are studied. This study measured the apparent value of twenty-six categories of recycling and reuse establishments. The direct output of these entities is, therefore, their reported gross sales. The direct jobs are the jobs that are associated with those establishments. The direct personal income contains their reported payments to all employees, plus an additional estimate of benefit values and of returns to sole proprietors. The estimate of benefit values and returns to sole proprietors were based on industrial averages in industries that are similar to the recycling and reuse industries included in this study. Indirect effects measure the value of additional economic demands that the direct firms or institutions place on supplying industries. When firms produce goods or conduct business or when public entities provide public goods or services, they must make many purchases. Some of these are from suppliers in the area. Some are not. Public utilities, communications systems, fuel, wholesale goods and services, manufactured goods, financial and legal services, raw and processed commodities, and a variety of professional services are necessary to produce the direct values described above. Induced effects accrue when workers in the direct and indirect industries spend their earnings on goods and services in the region. Induced effects can also be called household effects, and the terms are often used interchangeably. When workers in direct  n  n  n  Economic data is further reported as direct, indirect, induced, and total economic effects. n  n  n  21  For example, a restaurant may employ 20 people on a half-time basis (20 jobs) to fill its labor requirement of 10 full-time-equivalents.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  5-3   SECTION 5 and indirect industries purchase goods and services for household consumption, they, in turn, stimulate another layer of the economy. Most induced activity accrues to retail, services, and finance, insurance, and housing spending. Because employment is stimulated in these industries as well, their demands for inputs increase, yielding an additional round or additional rounds of indirect purchases and additional rounds of induced activity. The I-O models solve for these iterative rounds of transactions until all of the possible inter-industrial transactions have been accumulated. n  Total economic effects are the sum of direct, indirect, and induced effects. They are all of the transactions attributable, either directly or indirectly, to the activities of establishments in the business categories included in this study.  The term multiplier or multiplier effect is frequently used when referring to economic effects or economic impacts. There are different kinds of multipliers  this study reports two types. The Type I multiplier identifies the value of direct and indirect transactions  e.g., the output of a business category and all other output that it purchases from its suppliers in the region  relative to the value of only the direct transactions. The Type II multiplier identifies the value of all economic transactions (direct, indirect, and induced) that are stimulated in the economy by an industry under study, including the personal spending of employees throughout the supply chain whose economic activity is apportioned to the industry, relative to the value of only the direct transactions.  5.2 RESULTS Table 5-1 shows estimates of economic activity accruing to establishments in business categories that provide goods or services to recycling and reuse industry establishments. The category Other Indirect Establishments shown in the table includes all other indirect establishments that provide goods or services (such as office supply companies, accounting firms, legal firms, building and landscape maintenance firms, etc.).

W. Beck, Inc.   INDIRECT 5.3 INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS  AND INDUCED ECONOMIC INFORMATION  This section is intended to aid readers in interpreting the results of the tables in the previous section. Economic values are most accurate at the business category level. Summing totals by groups of recycling or reuse activity (as has been done in the tables) results in some degree of duplicated accounting of economic activity. This is endemic in any broad sector input-output modeling scenario where direct industry businesses are related to each other as part of a chain  it is not a problem with recycling, per se, nor with this study, but arises simply because of the inter-business relationships that are included in this study. For example, direct sales by a raw commodity processor are counted once as direct economic activity; however, those sales also represent an input purchase by an industry producing a finished good for sale, and are counted a second time as indirect economic activity stimulated by the industry producing the finished good. In this case, then, aggregation biases the subtotals and totals upwards for indirect, induced, and total effects. As a general rule, the higher the Type I multiplier (which is a measure of how strongly a firm depends on supplier inputs), the higher the probability of aggregation bias in reporting subtotals and totals. This is an inherent ""Catch 22"" in input-output modeling: to eliminate aggregation bias of this sort, the industries must be lumped together in the construction of the model so that inter-industrial transactions are properly accounted and the resulting multipliers are properly dampened. Doing so, however, eliminates the industrial detail that is desired. Nevertheless, subtotals and totals have been produced so that relative comparisons can be made. Users of these findings, however, must be cautious to avoid claims about the recycling and reuse industry that may be unwarranted given that there is some degree of inflation in the subtotals or totals. Based on other modeling experience, it is believed that aggregation bias may have inflated the subtotals and totals by up to 15 percent, and possibly higher. It is important to note that this bias is associated with any total that is derived from indirect and induced information, including total economic activity, subtotal/total multipliers, and total government tax revenues. Alternatively, totals derived only from direct information and government tax revenues derived from direct economic activity do not include bias . Multipliers reveal potential changes in an economy attributable to a change in direct activity in a particular industry in that same economy. Multipliers can be instructive for anticipating economic growth, in the case of a new or expanding firm, and economic decline, in the case of a plant closing. Economic multipliers are often misunderstood and therefore improperly used. Developers, planners, and decision-makers frequently use national level multipliers to support economic investment or public spending. Many users, however, mistakenly apply these statistics because they: n  Fail to account for regional production and cost of living differences (detailed multipliers are available at the state and county level, but project promoters often rely on national averages due to costs); Use the wrong multiplier to describe a phenomenon (multipliers for different categories of economic activity can vary substantially); or Seek to promote industries with the largest multipliers possible without consideration of either the appropriateness of the application or of the actual scope of local production. understand what economy or that Firms that are pay lower than 5-9  n n  Before making any comparisons among multipliers, it is important to influences them. Firms with strong linkages to supplying firms in the same pay relatively high wages may yield comparatively higher multipliers. otherwise not linked strongly to suppliers in the same economy or that R. W. Beck, Inc.   SECTION 5 average wages will usually produce lower multipliers. More urbanized areas and states with larger and more diversified economies have, on the average, much higher multipliers than less populated, more rural states for the same types of businesses because money stays and circulates through longer chains in their economies. Once money leaves an economy, no additional indirect or induced activity is accumulated to the credit to the initiating industry. For this reason the multipliers found in this report should never be compared to local or state multipliers because their much smaller economic boundaries necessarily produce smaller multipliers. For the same reason, multipliers from this report should not be used to estimate local or state impacts associated with expanding or implementing programs or policies in support of recycling and reuse. Given the above guides to interpreting the data, there are a couple of general conclusions that can be drawn: n  Manufacturing establishments generally pay well compared to other types of establishments because of their need for employees with high levels of skill and training. Furthermore, the nature of manufacturing places strong demands (linkages) on supplier firms for materials, supplies, and utilities (energy). These two factors contribute to high multipliers for manufacturing compared to other segments of the economy. Non-ferrous smelting and refining mills, paper and paperboard mills, non-ferrous product producers, and steel mills (all recycling manufacturing sector categories) tended to have higher multipliers than establishments in other recycling and reuse industry business categories. The recycling and reuse industry's multipliers generally exceed the multipliers of other major sectors of the U.S. economy, with the exception of manufacturing, which leads all sectors. The contribution of the recycling manufacturing sector to the overall recycling and reuse industry size explains why the industry's multipliers fall where they do in comparison to other major industry sector multipliers. Investments in local recycling collection and processing and policies that encourage recycling and reuse yield significant total federal, state, and local government tax revenues. For example, 83 percent of total tax revenues attributable to the recycling and reuse industry arise from recycling manufacturing establishments and their indirect and induced economic activity. The federal and stage governments collect 80 percent of total tax revenues attributable to the recycling and reuse industry. Local governments collect the remaining 20 percent of tax revenues. Corporate income taxes make up less than ten percent of taxes attributable to the recycling and reuse industry  personal income taxes paid by employees and a variety of charges and fees make up the remainder.  n  n  n  n  n  5-10  R.

Recommendations are: Consider using the new NAICS system code, 56292, which is specifically for MRFs, instead of using survey data. Because of inconsistencies between the NAICS MRF data and other published date, MRFs were surveyed for this study. Narrow the definition of compost and organics producers. The definition of compost and organics was very broad, resulting in a large number of listings that were municipal mulching operations or only a small portion of a larger facility, such as a MRF or transfer station, with very little organics economic activity. Conduct additional research on the industrial characteristics of recycling and reuse firms to improve the explanatory power of I-O models. This research should focus on the following areas: n  n  n  Improving input-output tables (use, make, total requirements) for critical recycling and reuse industries so that inter-industrial transactions are better understood. Furthermore, constructing similar tables for non-recycling industries will allow better comparisons between recycling and non-recycling businesses. Identifying critical costs associated with the flow of recycled products into goods for final use.  n  Finally, follow-up studies that would be useful should be considered, including: n  Additional research to better document intermediate input statistics for recycling businesses and to enable comparisons between recycling and non-recycling businesses in the same industry; Determining the amount of growth over today's baseline (as measured through this report) that could be realized by additional levels of recycling and reuse.  n  W:\004016-NRC\032527-National REI\Report\National\print report\report5.doc  6-1   APPENDIX A DESCRIPTION OF RECYCLING AND REUSE BUSINESS CATEGORIES Table A-1 provides detailed descriptions of 30 recycling and reuse business categories, grouped into 5 industry segments. The table is intended to comprehensively include all business establishments undertaking recycling and reuse economic activities, as defined in Section 2. Table A-1 lists Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes for each category. These codes were identified by comparing each category to the official definitions listed in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1987, prepared by the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget. Note that in most cases, the listed SIC category also includes businesses not involved in recycling and reuse. Beginning in 1997 the SIC system will gradually be phased out and replaced by the new North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which is harmonious with systems used in Mexico and Canada, in accordance with the North American Free Trade Agreement. Table A-1 also lists the NAICS codes that correspond to the traditional SIC codes. Where the NAICS categories differ significantly, the new category name is provided. Notable changes in the NAICS system include a new category for material recovery facilities, and a division of SIC 4953, Refuse Systems into separate categories for haulers and disposal facility operators handling hazardous, solid and other wastes.

Beck in the postage-paid envelope.  3 of 3   Appendix E Analysis of Survey Results The methodology and survey forms that were used in several state and regional recycling economic information studies22 that were conducted in association with this US REI study were consistent with those of this study. This allowed survey data from those studies, which covered 16 states that compose 46 percent of the nation's population, to be used to partially determine national results for survey categories by summing the results of each individual study. The contribution of the remaining 34 states was determined by conducting surveys from a random sample of establishments in those remaining states and performing a statistical analysis of survey results for those states as a group. The results of the statistical analysis from the 34-state group were then added to the sum of the results of the other studies to arrive at national totals. The statistical analysis of the survey data provided by establishments that completed surveys identified the recycling characteristics of the average establishment in each of the twelve survey business categories. These averages were then applied to all recycling and reuse establishments in each survey category to estimate the total number of employees23 and dollar value of payroll and receipts. Survey information was solicited from 627 establishments, just under ten percent of the 6,574 total establishments in the study database identified as potentially being in one of the twelve survey categories in the 34-state group. Data obtained from 212 establishments formed the basis of the statistical analysis. Because many of the establishments initially included in the database were found to have been misclassified or gone out of business, it was necessary to re-estimate the number of establishments in each survey category before extrapolating average statistical data. In the 34-state group, 3,576 establishments are believed to be involved in recycling activities in the twelve survey categories. The procedure for estimating the total number of establishments in each category consisted of several steps. First, businesses in the database that were randomly selected to be surveyed were sent a survey in the mail, followed-up with several telephone calls if the failed to respond to the mailing. Those that were unrelated, unreachable, duplicate, or out of business were eliminated. Those businesses that were either completely or partially responsive to the survey, as well as those that declined to participate or were uncooperative were counted. Further adjustments were made for businesses that changed from one category to another. The following example will illustrate the procedure used to develop the final estimate of 1,069 establishments in category 3, compost and organics processors, for the 34-state group: n n  From the initial list of 2,226 establishments that were classified as potentially being compost and organics processors, a random sample of 58 was contacted; Of these 58, 6 establishments moved out of this recycling category into other categories and 25 were eliminated (unrelated, unreachable, duplicate entries, or out of business)  furthermore, 3 moved into the category (from other categories)  resulting in 30 establishments in this category.  22  Those studies include one conducted by the Northeast Recycling Council for the ten-state region as a whole (and state-level data for Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont); individual statelevel studies conducted as part of this study for California, Florida, Indiana, Nebraska, and Ohio ; and an independent study conducted concurrently by Illinois with an agreement to share results. 23  Employee responses were adjusted to a full-time equivalent basis. Thus, two employees each working 50% on recycling activities would be counted as one employee. W:\004016-NRC\032527-National REI\Report\National\print report\report5.doc  E-1   APPENDIX E n  To these 30, we added 1,039 additional establishments, based on the observed ""success"" rate of the attempted sample and the relative amount of establishments that moved into the category, for a total of 1069 establishments.24  For each variable (employment, payroll, and receipts), the sample mean, standard deviation, and other related statistics were calculated. Based on the sample size and estimate of the total number of establishments engaged in recycling in this business category, ranges were constructed that should contain the true average value for the typical recycling business in the category.25 Finally, by multiplying this range by the estimate of the total number of recycling businesses in the category, we obtain a range for the total values for each variable. Continuing with the previous example, the analysis was as follows: n n n n  22 responses were usable of the 30 establishments that were surveyed and identified as belonging in the category; Average number of employees, payroll, and receipts for these 22 responses was calculated; Standard deviations and other related statistics necessary to determine a 95% confidence interval for the average of all establishments in this business category was calculated; and The low, average, and high values for the confidence interval were then multiplied by the estimated total establishments in this category (30) to yield the estimated range of the total number of employees, payroll, and receipts.  To finish this particular example, the sample of 22 establishments employed (on average) 22.1 persons per establishment in recycling activities on a full-time equivalent basis. However, given the sample size and the estimate of the total number of establishments in this business category, the actual average number of employees per establishment might range from a low of 0.5 to a high of 53. Thus, while 23,625 employees are expected to be involved in recycling activities for the entire set of 1,069 establishments in this business category, there may be as few as 486 or as many as 56,550. Another point should also be made regarding small population sampling as it applies to certain categories. Given the small number of total establishments engaged in certain business categories, the low end of the estimates is often constrained by the fact that it cannot be less than the value already observed in the sample itself. This is the case for compost and organics processors where, for example, the expected value of 23,625 total employees is bounded by a low estimate of 486 because it is already known, through survey data, that 486 employees work for the establishments sampled in this category. As this issue affects the results, it serves to make certain estimates more accurate than would otherwise be possible. As was mentioned previously, extrapolated results for the 34-state group were added to extrapolated survey results covering the other 16 states. A similar statistical analysis to that described above was conducted for each of those other studies. However, because much smaller numbers of establishments exist in each category at the state level, significantly larger percentages of establishments were surveyed in those cases (in many cases 100 percent) to ensure confidence in the results at the state level. In total, on the national level, 1,227 out of 4,964 establishments (25 percent) provided survey data for direct recycling and reuse industry survey categories.  24  Of the 58 establishments we attempted to contact in this category, only 27 correctly belonged in the category. We applied this 47% ""success"" ratio to the 2,168 establishments not contacted of the originally estimated 2,226 establishments, adding 1,009 establishments. Furthermore, we added another 30 establishments through allocation from the group of establishments not surveyed, based on the relative proportion of surveyed establishments that were originally classified in another category but properly belonged in the compost and organics producers category. 25  Technically speaking, these ranges can be described as 95% confidence intervals.

Although the industry overall performs recycling or reuse-related activities, it may include some establishments with no recycling or reuse-related activities. 2 Covered activities is defined as all activities that support:  Transforming pre-consumer materials or post-consumer products into a recycled material;  Transforming recycled materials into a first intermediate product (e.g. sheet, fiber, roll);  Transforming recycled materials directly into a finished product;  Preparing used products for reuse; and  Manufacturing equipment for the recycling or reuse industries. Covered activities do not include converting a first intermediate product to finished or semi-finished products or preparing materials for fuel use. 3 Statistics are for establishments with some amount of covered recycling activities. Establishments may perform both non-recycling and recycling activities. 4 These estimates include activities where virgin and recycled feedstock materials are co-processed. The estimates do not include virgin-only feedstock material preparation activities and further conversion of intermediate products to finished or semi-finished goods. 5 Statistics on establishments where 100 percent of labor and receipts are dependent on recycling or reuse-related activities. The estimates do not include virginonly feedstock material preparation activities and further conversion of intermediate products to finished or semi-finished goods. 6 The data for Category 1, Government Staffed Residential Curbside Collection, was derived through an algorithm based on data points from a variety of sources.

For Category 2, Data Label D is ""Percent of Homes Collected by Private Sector."" 9 Throughput is derived by subtracting the Government Staffed Curbside Collection tonnage estimate from the sum of processing estimates for Compost and Organics Producers, Materials Recovery Facilities, and Recyclable Material Wholesalers. 10 Number of establishments for all survey categories is based on the REI study database. 11 Unless noted otherwise, number of employees, payroll, receipts, and throughput for all survey categories is based on a statistical analysis of California survey results. See Section 3.2.2 for a detailed description of survey design and calculations. The number of completed surveys on which results are based is given as ""n.""  F-6  R. W.

As a result, number of establishments, potential economic activity, and throughput associated with inactive composting techniques (i.e., allowing materials to slowly and independently decompose over time) may not be fully reflected in totals. 13 Data obtained from the U.S. Census, 1997 Economic Census. See Section 3.2.1.2 for a detailed description of the use of Census Bureau statistics. 14 Data are taken directly from U.S. Census, 1997 Economic Census for NAICS code 421930  Recyclable Material Wholesalers. This category includes a number of different types of businesses including scrap metal and plastics dealers, C&D processors, beneficiation facilities, crumb rubber producers and textile processors. No adjustments were made to Census data since the category is defined as 100 percent recycling-related. 15 Throughput for Recyclable Material Wholesalers is derived as follows: ferrous scrap processor revenue/$128 per ton + paper processor revenue/$126 per ton + other wholesalers/$300 per ton. 16 Data for 1996 taken from the California Integrated Waste Management Board's Glass Marketing Guide, June 11, 1998. 17 Number of establishments and throughput are taken from Column D with no adjustments. Employment, annual payroll, and estimated receipts are derived from Column D with an adjustment for the percent of covered activities (90 percent). 18 Throughput is derived from a combination of survey results and 1996 fiberglass plant consumption from the California Integrated Waste Management Board's Glass Marketing Guide, June 11, 1998. 19 Throughput for nonferrous smelting and refining is estimated based on national scrap consumption for smelting and refining mills from the 1997 Economic Census and information from the USGS' publication Minerals Information  1997, Recycling  Metals. Allocation to the state level is based on a ratio of state employment to national employment for this industry. 20 Employment, payroll, and receipts are derived from Column D with an adjustment for the percent of covered activities (95 percent). Number of establishments and throughput are from Column D with no adjustment. 21 Data are derived by multiplying Column C figures by 50 percent, the percentage of establishments assumed to be utilizing scrap or recycled materials, based on comments from U.S.G.S. nonferrous metals specialists. 22 Throughput for Nonferrous Product Producers is estimated based on nationwide scrap purchases for this industry as reported in the 1997 Economic Census. Allocation to the state level is based on a ratio of state employment to national employment for this industry. 23 Throughput for Nonferrous Foundries is estimated based on scrap purchases reported in the 1997 Economic Census. Total tons of scrap for the U.S. is calculated as: Total Scrap Cost (by NAICS code) / ($0.45/lb for aluminum or $0.72/lb. for copper) / (2,000 lbs /ton). Tons of scrap on a state-level is estimated as: Total tons x State Employees/U.S. Employees. 24 Estimates of establishments, employees, payroll, receipts, and throughput are derived from Column C based on information on mills that consume recovered paper from AF&PA's Paper Matcher and mill capacity data from Lockwood Post's Directory of the Pulp, Paper, and Allied Trades . Throughput is taken from the AF&PA Annual Statistical Summary Recovered Paper Utilization (April, 1999). Throughput numbers used are for 1997 to coincide with the data from the 1997 Economic Census. 25 Estimates of employees, payroll, and receipts are derived from Column D with an adjustment for the percent of covered activities (95 percent). The split between Columns E and F comes from mill capacity data from Lockwood Post's Directory of the Pulp, Paper, and Allied Trades and AF&PA's Paper Matcher which provided information on types of recovered paper consumed by individual mills. 26 For Plastics Reclaimers, establishments, employees, and throughput are based on the American Plastics Council Handler & Reclaimer database developed by R.W. Beck. Payroll is calculated by multiplying employment figures by Census Bureau's 1997 average wage for California plastics industry employees ($28,746).  R. W. Beck, Inc.  F-7   APPENDIX F  S  TATE DATA T ABLES  Estimated receipts is calculated by multiplying throughput of recycled resins produced times an average of recycled resin prices from Plastics News. Throughput is derived from per-employee averages from American Plastics Council statistics as compiled by R. W. Beck. 27 Establishments, employees, payroll, and receipts in Column C for Plastics Converters are obtained from the Society of the Plastics Industry's Economic Report 2000 for plastics converters (NAICS codes 325991 and 3261) plus additional estimates for captive plastics converting operations by establishments classified in other non-plastics industries. 28 Number of establishments, employees, payroll, and estimated receipts in Column D are derived by multiplying Column C figures by the industry-wide recycledcontent percentage (5.7 percent) divided by the average recycled content of products that contain recycled materials (35 percent). 29 Throughput is calculated from the state's percentage of national plastics converter employees multiplied by the total tons of plastics recycled nationally (APC Plastics Recycling Rate Study as compiled by R. W. Beck, with additions for pre-consumer plastics recycled). 30 Number of establishments and throughput are directly from Column D. Employees, payroll, and receipts are derived from Column D by multiplying by the estimated percent of employees at recycling-related establishments that are involved in covered recycling-related activities (80 percent). 31 Establishments, employees, and throughput data are derived from Association of Iron and Steel Engineers directory listings that exclude non-integrated mills (NAICS 3311114), which do not make steel. 32 Employment and payroll data are derived from national averages allocated on a per-employee basis. 33 Employment, payroll, and receipts are equal to estimates from Column D multiplied by 95 percent (5 percent deduction to account for downstream conversion). Based on comments from SRI, 100 percent of steel mills are dependent on recovered steel to make new steel, utilizing anywhere from 15 percent-100 percent recovered steel. Therefore, the only deduction taken is to account for non-covered activities. Establishments and throughput are from Column D with no adjustment. 34 For Iron and Steel Foundries, estimates for Column D are taken directly from U.S. Census SSEL with no adjustments. SRI states that all foundries as a matter of practice utilize a significant percentage of scrap in the making of new iron products. 35 Throughput for Iron and Steel Foundries is estimated as the state's percentage of total national foundry employees multiplied by national scrap consumption by foundries (1997 Economic Census). 36 In Column E, establishments and throughput are taken directly from Column D. Employees, payroll, and receipts from Column D are multiplied by 95 percent, the estimated percent of foundry employees involved in covered recycling-related activities. 37 The 1997 Economic Census only reported number of establishments for Motor Vehicle Parts to avoid disclosing individual company information. Estimates for employment, payroll, and receipts are derived from California per-establishment average data from the U.S. Census' 1996 Standard Statistical Establishments List for SIC code 5015 (Motor Vehicle Parts) times the number of establishments from the 1997 Economic Census for NAICS code 421140. 38 Estimates for Retail Used Merchandise Sales are taken directly from the 1997 Economic Census for NAICS code 453310 with no adjustments. 39 Estimates for Tire Retreaders are taken directly from the 1997 Economic Census for NAICS code 326212 with no adjustments.

Members of the committee, selected by OMB on  the basis of their individual expertise and interest in  statistical methods, serve in a personal capacity rather than as  agency representatives.  The committee conducts its work through  subcommittees that are organized to study particular issues.  The  subcommittees are open by invitation to Federal employees who  wish to participate.  Working papers are prepared by the  subcommittee members and reflect only their individual and  collective ideas.     The Subcommittee on Small Area Estimation was formed in 1991 to  document the uses of indirect estimators by Federal statistical  agencies to prepare and publish estimates.  An indirect estimator  uses values of the variable of interest from a domain and/or time  period other than the domain and time period of the estimate  being produced.  Users of indirect estimators should consider the  errors to which these estimates are subject.     Eight programs that publish indirect estimators are described in  this report.  These programs sometimes respond to legislative  requirements or, alternatively, to State data needs.  The  programs and sponsor agencies are: infant and maternal health  characteristics (National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS));  personal income, annua1 income, and gross product (Bureau of  Economic Analysis); postcensal population estimates for counties  (Bureau of the Census (BOC)); employment and unemployment for  States (Bureau of Labor Statistics); cotton, rice, and soybean  acreage (National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS));  livestock inventories, crop production, and acreage (NASS);  disabilities, hospital utilization, physician and dental visits  (NCHS); and median income for 4-person families (BOC).     The Subcommittee on Small Area Estimation was chaired by  Wesley L.

Domains are commonly defined by demographic and  socioeconomic variables.  However, geographic location is perhaps the  single variable used most frequently to define domains.  Regions,  states, counties, and metropolitan areas are common geographic domains  for which estimates are required.  Federal agencies use different data  systems and estimation methods to produce domain estimates.  Those  systems designed for the purpose of producing published estimates use  standard, direct estimation methods.  Data systems are designed within  time, cost and other constraints which restrict the number of  estimates that can be produced by standard methods.  However, the  demand for additional information and the lack of resources to design  the required dam systems have led federal statistical agencies to  consider non-standard methods.  Estimation methods of a particular  type, referred to as small area or indirect estimators, have sometimes  been used in these situations.           The purpose of this report is to document, in a manner that will  facilitate comparisons, the practices and estimation methods of the  federal statistical programs that use indirect estimators.  Only  programs that use indirect estimators for the production of published  estimates are included; whether a data system is based on a census  (including administrative records) or a: sample survey has no bearing  on the inclusion of a program.  The focus of this report is on the  method by which estimates are produced.  The methods and practices of  eight programs are documented here; three are located in the  Department of Commerce, two in the Department of Agriculture, two in  the Department of Health and Human Services, and one in the Department  of Labor.  Other applications of indirect estimators occur in federal  statistical agencies but descriptions of these applications have not  been included in this report.  Most of these methods were not included  because they were not used, to produce published estimates.  This  publication restriction, a somewhat arbitrary indicator of program  importance, keeps the number of programs included to a manageable  level but leads to the omission of other interesting methods (for  example, Fay and Herriott 1979).            This introductory chapter includes brief discussions of small area  estimation terminology; definitions of direct and indirect estimators;  some characteristics, of indirect estimators; and summary descriptions  of the programs included in the report.  Each program is documented,  following a standard format, in the individual chapters of the report.  The intent is to create program descriptions that will not only  provide complete, self-contained documentation for each individual  program but also facilitate comparisons among programs.  Although the  focus of the report is on estimation methods, the description of each  program includes material on program history, policies, evaluation  practices, estimation methods, and current, problems and activities.  In addition to the standard chapter format, attempts have been made to  employ common notation throughout the chapters to facilitate  comparisons of estimation methods.  The report, concludes with a  number of recommendations and cautions.        1.2 Terminology          Terms used to describe indirect estimators can be confusing.  Increased interest in non- traditional estimators for domain  statistics has occurred recently among survey statisticians and, even  though the term ""small area estimator"" is commonly used, uniform  terminology has not yet evolved.  This term is frequently used because  in most applications of these estimators the domains of interest have  been geographic areas.  However, the word ""small"" is misleading.  It  is the small number of sample observations and the resulting large  variance of standard direct estimators that is of concern, rather than  the size of the population in the area or the size of the area itself  The word ""area"" is also misleading since these methods may be applied  to any arbitrary domain, not just those defined by geographic  boundaries.  Other terms used to describe these estimators include  ""local area"" (Ericksen 1974), ""small domain"" (Purcell and Kish 1979),  subdomain"" (Laake 1979), ""small subgroups"" (Holt, Smith, and Tomberlin  1979), subprovincial"" (Brackstone 1987), ""indirect"" (Dalenius 1987),  and ""model-dependent"" (Sarndal 1984).  The term ""synthetic estimator""  has also been used to describe this class of estimators (NIDA 1979)  and, in addition, to describe a specific indirect estimator (NCHS  1968).  Survey practitioners sometimes refer to indirect estimators as  ""model-based"" whereas this term is rarely, if ever, used to describe  direct estimators.  However, direct estimators can be motivated by and  justified under models as readily as indirect estimators.         There is also lack of agreement on what to call the class of  direct estimators.  In addition to ""direct"" (Royall 1973), authors  have used ""unbiased"" (Gonzalez 1973), ""standard"" (Holt, Smith, and  Tomberlin 1979), ""valid"" (Gonzalez 1979), and ""sample-based"" (Kalton  1987).  In the remainder of this paper, the words ""direct"" and  ""indirect"" will be used to describe traditional and small area  estimators, respectively.              1.3 Direct and Indirect Estimators     Perhaps the most common measure of error of an estimator is the mean  square error, composed of the sum of the variance of the estimator and  the squared bias of the estimator.  Biases can rarely be estimated  with any degree of confidence.  If an estimator is unbiased or  approximately unbiased, the variance of the estimator, which can be  estimated from the available data, is a satisfactory measure of error  of the estimator.  This leads to the selection of estimators that are  unbiased or approximately unbiased in most applications.  Such  estimators allow data systems to be designed so that estimates with a  predictable level of error can be produced with high probability and,  in addition, estimated measures of error can be provided to accompany  estimates.     Federal statistical programs are generally designed using direct  estimators which are unbiased, or approximately unbiased, under finite  population sampling theory.  Samples are often used and, given  adequate resources, the sample design specifies population and domain  sample sizes large enough to produce direct estimates that meet  reliability requirements for the survey.  When a domain sample size is  too small to make a reliable domain estimate using the direct  estimator, a decision must be made whether to produce estimates using  an alternative procedure.  The alternative estimators considered are  those that increase the effective sample size and decrease the  variance by using data from other domains and/or time periods through  models that assume similarities across domains and/or time periods.  These estimators are generally biased, but if the mean square error of  the alternative estimator can be demonstrated to be small compared to  the variance of the direct estimator, the selection of the alternative  estimator may be justified.  In extreme situations, there may be no  sample units in the domain of interest and, if an estimate is to be  produced, an alternative estimator will be required.     Indirect estimators have been characterized in the Bayesian and  empirical Bayes literature as estimators that ""borrow strength"" by the  use of values of the variable of interest from domains other than the  domain of interest.  This approach can be used to provide a working  definition of direct and indirect estimators for a broad class of  population quantities including means and totals.  A direct estimator  uses values of the variable of interest only from the time period of  interest and only from units in the domain of interest.  An indirect  estimator uses values of the variable of interest from a domain and/or  time period other than the domain and time period of interest.  Three  types of indirect estimators can be identified.  A domain indirect  estimator uses values of the variable of interest from another domain  but not from another time period.  A time indirect estimator uses  values of the variable of interest from another time period but not  from another domain.  An estimator that is both domain and time  indirect uses values of the variable of interest from another domain  and another time period.         Indirect estimators depend on values of the variable of interest  from domains and/or time periods other than that of interest.  These  values are brought into the estimation process through a model that,  except in the most trivial case, depends on one or more auxiliary  variables that are known for the domain and time period of interest.  To the extent that applicable models can be identified and the  required auxiliary variables are available, indirect estimators can be  created to produce estimates.  Perhaps the simplest example of an  indirect estimator is the use of the sample mean of the entire sample  as the estimator for a specific domain.  For example, the use of the  mean from a national sample as an estimate for a particular state.  To  the extent that information related to the variable of interest is  available for the state, an indirect estimator which is ""better"" than  the national mean can be defined.  The availability of auxiliary  variables and an appropriate model relating the auxiliary variables to  the variable of interest are crucial to the formation of indirect  estimators.  However, the definition of direct and indirect estimators  does not depend on whether or not auxiliary variables from outside the  domain or time period of interest are used.     The clear distinction between direct and indirect estimators made in  the discussion above reflects the situation during the design stage of  a data system.  However, when estimators reflect the realities  associated with data system implementation, the distinction becomes a  little less clear.  For example, nonresponse is a common problem in  dam collection efforts.  To the extent that nonresponse occurs, even  direct estimators must rely on model-based assumptions relating the  known information for responders to the unknown information for  nonresponders.        1.4 Organization of Program Chapters          As discussed in the previous section, indirect estimators borrow  strength and can be classified into three types: domain indirect, time  indirect, and domain/time indirect.  In addition to this  classification, indirect estimators are commonly expressed in  different forms, that is different algebraic expressions.  Each of the  eight programs described in this report uses one of the following  three common indirect estimators: synthetic, regression, or composite.  The order of chapters describing programs follows this classification  of estimators.  That is, the program that uses a synthetic estimator  is presented first in Chapter 2, followed by the programs that use  regression estimators in Chapters 3 through 6; those programs that use  composite estimators are presented in Chapters 7 through 9.  Some of  the programs have used different estimators at different times;  however, emphasis is placed on the estimator that was last used to  publish estimates.          As with all indirect estimators, synthetic estimators may be  domain indirect, time indirect, or domain and time indirect.  For  example, a domain indirect synthetic estimator for a population total  in domain d and time t may be written as        Click  HERE  for graphic.         Regression estimators may be direct or, like the synthetic estimator,  domain indirect, time indirect, or domain and time indirect depending  on how the parameters are estimated.  For example, a domain indirect  regression estimator for a population total may be written as        Click  HERE  for graphic.           Click  HERE  for graphic.        It should be noted that not all indirect estimators are linear.  For  examples of nonlinear indirect estimators see MacGibbon and Tomberlin  (1989) and Malec, Sedransk, and Tompkins (1993).  This latter,  nonlinear indirect estimator is being considered for use in  conjunction with the National Health Interview Survey and is discussed  in Chapter 8.        1.5 Characteristics of Indirect Estimators          There are several fairly well-known characteristics of indirect  estimators that are important for producers and users to keep in mind.        o In general, indirect estimators have relatively small variances  since they not only incorporate observations from the domain and time  period of interest, but also, from other domains and/or time periods.  The variance of a modified synthetic estimator is discussed by Holt,  Smith, and Tomberlin (1979) and variances of several indirect  estimators resulting from different prediction models are discussed by  Royall (1979).  Care must be taken since the variance alone may be a  misleading measure of error.  See, for example, Raback and Sarndal  (1982) and Sarmdal and Hidiroglou (1989).            o An indirect estimator will be biased if the model assumptions  leading to the estimator are not satisfied.  Even so, an indirect  estimator may be a useful alternative to a direct estimator when the  mean squared error of the indirect estimator is sufficiently small  compared to the variance of the direct estimator.  However, the  magnitude of the bias is likely to vary with each application and  estimation of biases is difficult.  Gonzalez and Waksberg (1973)  consider the problem of estimating the mean squared error of synthetic  estimators, and Prasad and Rao (1990) discuss the estimation of the  mean squared error of indirect estimators.  Care must be taken when  interpreting estimated mean squared errors of indirect estimators.  Some approaches provide an average measure over all domains rather  than a measure associated with a specific domain.  Confidence  intervals for biased estimators is a related issue that has, been  addressed by Miller (1992).         o For a given application and estimator, biases in different  domains will differ since the model will likely be a better  representation of reality in some domains than in others.  In general,  when an indirect estimator is used to produce estimates for a number  of domains, the distribution of estimates will have a smaller variance  than the corresponding distribution of domain population values.  This  is a result of the tendency for indirect estimators to have relatively  small biases when domain population values are close to the average  total population value and, when domain population values are not  close to the overall population value, to have relatively large  directional biases which make the estimates closer to the overall  population value.  There is considerable evidence illustrating this  characteristic (Gonzalez and Hoza 1978; Schaible et al. 1977 and 1979;  and Heeringa 1981).  Not all indirect estimators display this  characteristic to the same extent.  Spjovoll and Thomsen (1987),  Lahiri (1990), and Ghosh (1992) have addressed this problem and  suggest constrained approaches.         o From a model-based, prediction point of view, direct and  indirect estimators are model unbiased under the model that generates  the estimator.  A direct estimator is robust against model failure in  the sense that it is unbiased, not only under the domain/time specific  model which generates the estimator, but under each of the models  associated with the corresponding indirect estimators.  Indirect  estimators are not robust in the same sense.  However, the domain  indirect estimator and the time indirect estimator are both more  robust against model failure, in a similar sense, than the estimator  that is both domain and time indirect.  The bias of indirect  estimators, under the domain and time specific model, is a source of  concern that results in a reluctance to fully accept indirect  estimators in many applications.  An example and additional discussion  of this aspect of indirect estimator bias is given in Schaible (1993).           1.6 Program Summaries     The programs described in this report were initiated in response to a  variety of needs and directives.  Several are a direct result of  legislative requirements to allocate federal funds.  Others were  created in response to state needs for data and/or to standardize  estimation methods across states.  Others are viewed as research  programs that periodically publish estimates when an improved  methodology has been developed.  Table 1 below allows a comparison of  summary information on the programs described in Chapters 2 through 9  in this report.  The eight programs that use indirect estimators to  publish estimates are located in five large statistical agencies.  In  some instances, a program produces estimates for a single variable; in  other instances, estimates are produced for numerous variables.  States and counties are the only domains for which indirect estimates  are presently published.  Four of the programs publish estimates for  states, three for counties, and one for both states and counties.  There is considerable variability in the frequency with which  estimates are published.  Two programs publish estimates only  periodically, every few years.  The remainder publish indirect  estimates on a fixed schedule: four annually, one annually with  selected estimates on a quarterly schedule, and one monthly.  As noted  above, a variety of indirect estimators are used to produce estimates.  Synthetic, regression, and composite estimators that borrow strength  over domains, over time, or over both domain and time are found among  these programs.  The estimation procedures for six of the programs are  based on data from sample surveys.  There is no sampling involved in  the procedures used in the two programs that produce estimates of  personal income and postcensal populations.     Given the differing demands on Federal statistical agencies, it is not  surprising that considerable variation is seen in the programs  described in this report.  Further investigations and improvements in  the quality of indirect estimates published by Federal agencies are  needed.  It is hoped that recognition of the differences, as well as  the similarities, in these programs will help provide a foundation for  this further effort.              Click  HERE  for graphic.                                     REFERENCES     Brackstone, G.

Placek, and Chester Scott                       National Center for Health Statistics        2.1 Introduction and Program History        The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) through its vital  registration system collects and publishes data on vital events  (births and deaths) for the United States (NCHS 1989).  NCHS produces  national, State, county, and smaller area vital statistics for  sociodemographic and health characteristics which are available from  birth and death certificates.  The Division of Vital Statistics of  NCHS produces annual summary tables for the United States showing  trends in period and cohort fertility measures and characteristics of  live births.  Also, NCHS produces detailed tabulations by place of  residence and occurrence for each State, county, and city with a  population of 10,000 or more by race and place of delivery and place  of residence for population-size groups in metropolitan and  nonmetropolitan counties within each State by race, attendant and  place of delivery, and birth weight.  These statistics are based on a  complete count of vital records.     In addition to the limited vital statistics tabulations which are  produced annually, there has always been a continuing need for more  detailed national and State level estimates of health status, health  services, and health care utilization related to vital events.     Because vital records (birth and death certificates) serve both legal  and statistical purposes, they provide limited social, demographic,  health, and medical information.  Each vital record is a one page  document with extremely limited information.  The data from these  vital records can be augmented, however, through periodic ""followback""  surveys.  These surveys are referred to as ""followback"" because they  obtain additional information from sources named on the vital record.        A followback survey is a cost effective means of obtaining  supplementary information for a sample of vital events.  From the  sample it is possible to make national estimates of vital events  according to characteristics not otherwise available.  Examples of  supplementary information which may be needed by health researchers,  health program planners, and health policy makers are: mother's  smoking habits before and during pregnancy; complications of  pregnancy; drug or surgical procedure to induce or maintain labor;  amniocentesis during pregnancy; electronic fetal monitoring;  respiratory distress syndrome; infant jaundiced; medical x-ray use;  birth injuries; and, congenital anomalies.  Periodic followback  surveys respond to the changing data needs of the public health  community without requiring changes in the vital record forms.     The specific NCHS followback surveys that will be discussed in this  chapter are the 1980 National Natality Survey (NNS) and the 1980  National Fetal Mortality Survey (NFMS) (NCHS 1986).  In order to  produce State estimates for certain health characteristics not  available on the vital records, synthetic estimation (NCHS 1984a,  1984b) was applied to national data from the 1980 NNS and 1980 NFMS.  In addition to the usual appeal of using synthetic estimation over  direct estimation, especially when small sample sizes are concerned,  synthetic State estimates were compared to direct State estimates as  well as the ""true"" values for a limited number of variables from State  vital statistics via fetal death records and birth and death  certificates.        2.2 Program Description, Policies and Practices     The 1980 NNS is based on a probability sample of 9,941 from a universe  of 3,612,258 live births that occurred in the United States during  1980.  The NNS sample included a four-fold oversampling of low birth  weight infants.  The live birth certificate represents the basic  source of information.  Based on information from the sample birth  certificates, eight page Mother's questionnaires were mailed to  mothers who were married.  These mothers were asked to provide  information on prenatal health practices, prenatal care, previous  pregnancies, and social and demographic characteristics of themselves  and their husbands.  Each mother was also asked to sign a consent  statement authorizing NCHS to obtain supplemental information from her  medical records.  If the mother did not respond after two  questionnaires were sent by mail, a telephone interviewer attempted to  complete an abbreviated questionnaire and to obtain a consent  statement.  To ensure their privacy, unmarried mothers were not  contacted.  As a result of sending the Mother's questionnaire only to  married mothers, the 1980 NNS population of inference for data  collected through the Mother's questionnaire was 2,944,580 live  births.     Regardless of the mother's marital status, questionnaires were mailed  to the hospital's and to the attendants at delivery (for example,  physicians or nurse-midwives) named on the birth certificates.  A  questionnaire was sent to the hospital for each sample birth that  occurred either in a hospital or en route to a hospital.  If the  mother signed a consent statement authorizing NCHS to obtain  supplemental medical information, a copy was included with the  questionnaire.  The focus of the hospital questionnaire was on  characteristics of labor and delivery, health characteristics of the  mother and infant, information on prenatal care visits, and  information on radiation examinations and treatments received by the  mother during the 12 months before delivery of the sample birth.  For  the hospital component of the 1980 NNS, the population of inference  was 3,580,700 live births.     The 1980 NNS is composed of information from birth certificates and  information from questionnaires sent to married mothers, hospitals,  attendants at delivery, and providers of radiation examinations and  treatments.  The survey represents an extensive source of information  concerning specific maternal and child health conditions and obstetric  practices for live births in the United States.  The 1980 NNS response  rates were 79.5 percent for mothers, 76.1 percent for hospitals, and  61.6 percent for physicians.     The 1980 NFMS is based on a probability sample of 6,386 fetal deaths  (out of a universe of 19,202 fetal deaths) with gestation of 28 weeks  or more, or delivery weight of 1,000 grams or more, that occurred in  the United States during 1980.  The report of fetal death represent  the basic source of information in this survey.  Married mothers,  hospitals, attendants at delivery, and providers of radiation  examinations and treatments were surveyed under the same conditions as  those described for the 1980 NNS.  The 1980 NFMS populations of  inference for all fetal deaths, fetal deaths in hospitals, and fetal  deaths to married mothers were 19,202, 18,930, and 14,790,  respectively.  The same questionnaires were used for both surveys.  Although some questions pertained only to live births and other  pertained only to fetal deaths, instructions to skip inappropriate  questions were included in the questionnaires.  The sampling design  for the NFMS was developed so that the NFMS would be large enough to  permit comparisons between live births in the NNS and fetal deaths in  the NFMS.  The 1980 NFMS response rates were 74.5 percent for mothers,  74.0 percent for hospitals, and 55.0 percent for physicians.     Table 1 presents the 1980 NNS and NFMS distribution of sample cases of  live births and fetal deaths by State of occurrence.  As shown in  Table 1, it may be possible to produce direct State level estimates of  certain health characteristics for some of the larger States.  However, the sample sizes for most States are generally too small to  produce reliable direct State estimates.  This was the main  justification for exploring synthetic State estimation as an  alternative for producing State level estimates.        2.3 Estimator Documentation     The underlying rationale for synthetic estimation is that the  distribution of a health characteristic is highly related to the  demographic composition of the population (NCHS 1984a).  It is assumed  that differences in the prevalence of the characteristics between two  areas are due primarily to differences in demographic composition  (e.g. age, race, sex, etc.).  That is, it is assumed that a particular  measure would be the same in two States that had the same population  composition with respect to certain demographic variables.  This  rationale was used to select the demographic variables that were  deemed to be the most appropriate and relevant to the 1980 NNS and  NFMS in order to produce Synthetic State estimates.        The following is the basic estimator that was used to produce  Synthetic State estimates of proportions for certain health variables  from the 1980 National Natality Survey (NNS) and the 1980 National  Fetal Mortality Survey (NFMS).            Click  HERE  for graphic.              Table 2 gives an illustration of the computation of the synthetic  State estimate of the percent jaundiced infants in Pennsylvania in  1980.  The stub of Table 2 shows the 25 demographic cells (race, age  of mother, and live-birth order groups) that were used to produce the  Synthetic State estimates.  Column (1) shows the national (based on  the 1980 NNS) estimates of percent of live births that were jaundiced  in each of the respective 25 demographic cells.  Column (2) shows the  number of hospital births (derived from State Vital Registration  System) within the 25 demographic cells in Pennsylvania.  Column (3),  the estimated number of jaundiced live births in Pennsylvania, is  computed by taking the product of entries in columns (1) and (2)  within each of the 25 respective cells.  Finally, the Synthetic State  estimate is found by taking the ratio of the sum of column (3) to the  sum of column (2).     Since there were three different populations of inference (all vital  events, vital events to married mothers, and vital events in  hospitals) for each of the 1980 NNS and NFMS, appropriate State  aggregates of vital events were incorporated into the calculation of  corresponding synthetic State estimates (NCHS 1984a, 1984b).           2.4 Evaluation Practices     The following is a description of some of the tabulations that were  produced.  Table 3 gives Synthetic State estimates of 11 health  characteristics of mothers and infants for five selected States.  A  complete listing of all 57 NNS/NFMS health variables for which  Synthetic State estimates were produced can be found in Tables 2-8 in  (NCHS 1984a, 1984b).     Click  HERE  for graphic.     The synthetic State estimates are subject to sampling error because  they are based on corresponding national estimates derived from the  1980 NNS and NFMS by race, maternal age, and live-birth order group.  Therefore, the standard errors of the synthetic State estimates are  relatively small because they are based on the standard errors of the  national estimates.  The standard errors for the NNS and NMFS were  estimated by a balanced-repeated-replicated procedure using 20  replicate half samples.  This procedure estimates the standard errors  for survey estimates through the observation of the variability of  estimates based on replicate half samples of the total sample; This  variance estimation procedure was developed and described by McCarthy  (NCHS 1966, 1969).     Although the synthetic State estimate has a relatively small standard  error, it is subject to bias.  The bias is a measure of the extent to  which the national maternal age, race, live-birth order specific  estimates differ from the true values for a given State.  The closer  the demographic variables used in the synthetic estimate come to  accounting for all the interstate variation in a particular health  characteristic, the smaller the bias will be.  Unfortunately, the bias  cannot be computed without knowing the true values.  However, through  the U.S Vital Registration System, true State values for vital events  (collected through birth and death certificates) are known for a  limited number of available sociodemographic and health  characteristics.  Therefore, we can compare certain synthetic  estimates with their corresponding true values.  This yields a degree  of confidence for the synthetic estimates of similar characteristics  which cannot be checked against the true values from State vital  statistics.  Thus, the evaluation of this study only provides an  indicator of the quality of the synthetic State estimates.        The last two columns of Table 4 show the mean square error (MSE) of  the NNS synthetic.  estimates as compared with the MSE of the NNS  direct estimates.  The MSE of an estimate x is the variance of x plus  the square of the bias of x, i.e.        Click  HERE  for graphic.           2.5 Current Problems And Activities     Work is currently underway at NCHS to produce synthetic State  estimates from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey  (NMIHS) which is very similar to its predecessor the 1980 NNS and  NFMS.  In the NMIHS 9,953 out of a universe of 3,898,922 live-birth  certificates are linked with mothers' responses on 35-page  questionnaires about the mothers' prenatal health behavior, maternal  health, the birth experience, and infant health.  The 1988 NMIHS live  birth estimates will be used to produce synthetic State estimates by  infant's race.  birth weight, and maternal age and marital status.        Click  HERE  for graphic.        Click  HERE  for graphic.        Click  HERE  for graphic.        Click  HERE  for graphic.                                           REFERENCES     National Center for Health Statistics: Vital Statistics of the United  States, 1987 Vol. 1, Natality, DHHS Pub.

This program originated in  1939 when estimates of income payments to individuals by State were  first published.  At the national level, personal income is the  principal income measure in the personal income and outlay account,  one of the five accounts that compose the national income and product  accounts.  The State and local area personal income estimates are  derived by disaggregating the detailed components of the national  personal income estimates to States and counties.  Estimates for all  other geographic areas are made by aggregating either the State or  county estimates in the appropriate combinations.  This building block  approach permits estimates for areas whose boundaries change over  time, such as metropolitan areas, to be presented on a consistent  geographic definition for all years.     3.1.2 Uses of the State and Local Area Income Estimates     BEA's State and local area income estimates are widely used in the  public and private sector to measure and track levels and types of  incomes received by persons living or working in an area.  They  provide a framework for the analysis of each area's economy and serve  as a basis for decision making in both the public and private sectors.  Personal income is among the measures used in evaluating the  socioeconomic impact of public- and private-sector initiatives; for  example, it is widely used in preparing the environmental impact  statements required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.        One of the first uses made of State personal income estimates (or a  derivative) was as a variable in formulas for allocating Federal funds  to States.  The most often used derivative is per capita personal  income, which is computed using the Census Bureau's estimates of total  population; these population estimates are described by Long in  Chapter 4 of this report.  At present, BEA's State personal income  estimates are used by the Federal Government to allocate over $92  billion annually for various Federal domestic programs, including the  medical assistance (Medicaid) program, and the aid to families with  dependent children program.  Table 3.1 highlights the major Federal  Government programs which use BEA personal income estimates in  allocation formulas for Federal domestic assistance funds.     Federal agencies also use the components of personal income in  econometric models, such as those used to project energy and water  use.  The U.S. Forest Service is using these estimates to identify  resource dependent rural areas and to allocate funds for their  economic diversification as required by the National Forest-Dependent  Rural Communities Economic Diversification Act of 1990.     The U.S. Census Bureau uses the BEA estimates of State per capita  personal income as the key predictor variable in its estimates of mean  annual income for 4-person families by State.  These estimates are  described by Fay, Nelson, and Litow in Chapter 9 of this report.     During the past decade, State governments have substantially increased  their use of the State personal income estimates.  The estimates are  used in the measurement of economic bases and in models developed for  planning for such things as public utilities and services.  They are  also used to project tax revenues.  In recent years, legislation that  limits a State's expenditures or tax authority by the level of, or  changes in, State personal income or to one of its components has been  enacted in 16 States.  These 16 States account for nearly one-half of  the U.S. population.  Some of these States used BEA's annual State  personal income estimates; the others use fiscal year estimates  derived from BEA's quarterly State personal income estimates (ACIR,  1990).     State governments also use the local area estimates to measure the  economic base of State planning areas.  University schools of business  and economics, often worldng under contract for State and local  governments, use the BEA local area estimates for theoretical and  applied economic research.     Businesses use the estimates to evaluate markets for new or  established products and to determine areas for the location,  expansion, and contraction of their activities.  Trade associations  and labor organizations use them for product and labor market  analyses.     3.1.2 A History of BEA's Regional Income Estimates     In the mid-1930's, BEA's predecessor began work on the estimation of  regional income as part of the effort to explain the processes and  structure of the Nation's economy.  As a result of its work, it  produced a report that showed State estimates of total ""income  payments to individuals' in May 1939 (Nathan and Martin, 1939).  These  income payments were defined as the sum of        (1) wages and salaries, (2) other labor income and relief, (3)  entrepreneurial withdrawals, and (4) dividends, interest, and net  rents and royalties.     In 1942, the State estimates of wages and salaries and entrepreneurial  income were expanded to include a further breakdown by broad industry  group--agriculture, other commodity-producing industries,  distribution, services, and government.  The industry breakdown was  for 1939, when the availability of census information on payrolls and  the employed labor force by industry and by State made possible more  reliable estimates than for prior years (Creamer and Merwin, 1942).  The estimates for most nonagricultural industries and for the military  services were based on reports in which establishments, not employees,  were classified by State and in which the State of residence of the  employees was not indicated; therefore, the estimates for these  industries were on a ""place-of-work"" (where-earned) basis.  No  systematic adjustment was made in the total income payments series to  convert the estimates to a ""place-of-residence"" (where-received)  basis.  However, using the limited information that was available,  residence adjustments were made for a few States for the per capita  series.     During the later 1940's and early 1950's, BEA continued to work on  improving these estimates by seeking additional source data and by  improving the estimating methods that were used.  The industrial  detail of the wage and salary estimates was expanded to include each  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) division and additional  detail for some SIC divisions.  As one result of the major reworking  and expansion of the national income and product accounts, BEA  developed State personal income--a measure of income that is more  comprehensive than State income payments.     During the 1960's and 1970's, BEA continued its work to provide more  information about regional economies.  Annual State estimates of  disposable personal income were published in the April 1965 Survey of  Current Business (Survey), and the first set of quarterly estimates of  State personal income was published in the December 1966 Survey.  Estimates of personal income for metropolitan areas were published in  the May 1967 Survey, for nonmetropolitan counties in the May 1974  Survey, and for metropolitan counties in the April 1975 Survey.  In  the late 1970's, BEA introduced annual estimates of employment for  States, metropolitan areas, and counties.     Refinement of the residence adjustment procedures and a fuller  presentation of industrial detail for earnings--the term introduced to  cover wages and salaries plus other labor income plus proprietors'  income--emerged in the estimates published in 1974.  The residence  adjustment procedures had been extended to all States in 1966, but the  residence adjustment estimates (i.e., the net flows of interstate  commuters' earnings), along with earnings by industry on a  place-of-work basis, were not published explicitly until 1974.              3.2 The Regional Economic Measurement Program     3.2.1 Estimating Schedule for State and Local Area Personal Income Series     The annual estimates of State personal income for a given year are  subject to successive refinement.  Preliminary estimates, based on the  current quarterly series, are published each April, 4 months after the  close of the reference year, in the Survey.  The following August,  more reliable annual estimates are published.  These estimates are  developed independently of the quarterly series and are prepared in  greater component detail, primarily from Federal and State government  administrative records.  The annual estimates published in August are  subsequently refined to incorporate newly available information used  to prepare the local area estimates for the same year.  These revised  State estimates, together with the local area estimates, are published  the following April.  The annual estimates emerging from this  three-step process are subject to further revision for several  succeeding years (the State estimates in April and August and the  local area estimates in April), as additional data become available.  For example, the 1992 State estimates that were first released in  April 1993 will be revised in August 1993 and in April and August of  subsequent years; the 1991 local area estimates that were first  released in April 1993 will be revised in April of 1994 and of  subsequent years.  The routine revisions of the State estimates for a  given year are normally completed with the fourth April publication,  and the local area estimates, with the third April publication.  After  that, the estimates will be changed only to incorporate a  comprehensive revision of the National Income and Product  Accounts--which takes place approximately every 5 years--or to make  important improvements to the estimates through the use of additional  or more current State and local area data.     Quarterly estimates of State personal income, which are available  approximately 4 months after the close of the reference quarter, are  published regularly in the January, April, July, and October issues of  the Survey.  In,October and again the following April, the quarterly  series for the 3 previous years is revised for consistency with the  revised annual estimates.  In January and July, at least the quarter  immediately preceding the current quarter is revised.     3.2.2 Availability of State and Local Area Estimates     The State and local area personal income and employment estimates are  available through the Regional Economic Information System (REIS),  which operates an information retrieval service that provides a  variety of standard and specialized analytic tabulations for States,  counties and specified combinations of counties.  Standard tabulations  include personal income by type and earnings by industry, employment  by industry, transfer payments by program, and major categories of  farm gross income and expenses.  These tabulations are available from  REIS in magnetic tape, computer printout, microcomputer diskette and  CD-ROM; some of the tabulations are also available electronically on  the Department of Commerce's Economic Bulletin Board, available  through the National Technical Information Service.  In addition,  summary tabulations of the State and local estimates are published  regularly in BEA's major publication, the Survey.  An extensive set of  State-level historical estimates is available (BEA, 1989).     BEA also makes its regional estimates available through the BEA User  Group, members of which include State agencies, universities, and  Census Bureau Primary State Data Centers.  BEA provides its estimates  of income and employment for States, metropolitan areas, and counties  to these organizations with the understanding that they will make the  estimates readily available.  Distribution in this way encourages  State universities and State agencies to use data that are comparable  for all States and counties and that are consistent with national  totals; using comparable and consistent data enhances the uniformity  of analytic approaches taken in economic development programs and  improves the recipients' ability to assess local area economic  developments and to service their local clientele.        3.3  BEA Annual State and County Personal Income Estimation  Methodology     3.3.1 Overview     The following discussion will focus on the annual estimates of State  and county personal income.  BEA's quarterly State personal income,  annual State disposable personal income, annual State and county full-  and part-time employment, and gross State product (GSP) estimates are  produced in a manner similar to those described below.  (The  methodologies for quarterly State personal income and for annual State  disposable personal income are described in BEA (1989, pp. M-32-37);  the methodology for GSP is described in BEA (1985) and in Trott,  Dunbar, and Friedenberg (1991, pp. 43-45).     The personal income of an area is defined as the income received by,  or on behalf of, all the residents of the area.  It consists of the  income received by persons from an sources, that is, from  participation in production, from both government and business  transfer payments, and from government interest.  Personal income is  measured as the sum of wage and salary disbursements, other labor  income, proprietors' income, rental income of persons, personal  dividend income, personal interest income, and transfer payments less  personal contributions for social insurance.  Per capita personal  income is measured as the personal income of the residents of an area  divided by the resident population of the area.     At the national level, personal income is part of the personal income  and outlay account, which is one of five accounts in a set that  constitutes the national income and product accounts.  Such accounts  do not now exist below the national level; however, personal income  has long been available for States and local areas.  In addition, GSP,  which corresponds to the national measure gross domestic product, and  some elements of personal outlays (personal tax and nontax payments)  are available for States but not for local areas.  GSP is estimated  separately from State personal income, but the two measures share most  of the elements of wages and salaries, other labor income, and  proprietors' income by State of work.  For a tabular representation of  the relationships among gross domestic product, State earnings, and  GSP, see Table 2 in Trott et. al. (1991, p. 44).        3.3.2 Differences Between the National and Subnational Estimates     The definitions underlying the State and local area estimates of  personal income are essentially the same as those underlying the  national estimates of personal income.  However, the national  estimates of personal income include the labor earnings (wages and  salaries and other labor income) of residents of the United States  temporarily working abroad, whereas the subnational estimates include  the labor earnings of persons residing only in the 50 States and the  District of Columbia.  Specifically, the national estimates include  the labor earnings of Federal civilian and military personnel  stationed abroad and of residents who are employed by U.S. firms and  are on temporary foreign assignment.  An ""overseas"" adjustment is made  to exclude the labor earnings of these workers from the national  totals before the totals are used as controls for the State estimates.     An important classification difference between national and  subnational estimates relates to border workers--that is, residents of  the United States who work in adjacent countries (such as Canada) and  foreigners who work in the United States but who reside elsewhere.  At  the national level, the net flow of the labor earnings of border  workers and the labor earnings of U.S.  residents employed by  international organizations and by foreign embassies and consulates in  the United States are included in the measurement of the  ""rest-of-the-world"" sector.  At the State and local area levels,  however, only the labor earnings of U.S. residents employed by  international organizations and by foreign embassies and consulates in  the United States are treated as a component of personal income.  Border workers are treated as commuters and their earnings flows are  reflected in personal income through the residence adjustment  procedures.     Statistical differences between the national and subnational series  may reflect the different estimating schedules for the two series.  The State and local area estimates usually incorporate source data  that are not available when the national estimates are prepared.  The  national estimates are usually revised the following year to reflect  the more current State and local area data.     3.3.3 Sources of Data     BEA uses information collected by others to prepare its estimates of  State and local area personal income.  Generally, two kinds of  information are used to measure the income of persons: Information  generated at the point of disbursement of the income and information  elicited from the recipient of the income.  The first kind is data  drawn from the records generated by the administration of various  Federal and State government programs; the second kind is survey and  census data.     The following are among the more important sources of the  administrative record data: The State unemployment insurance programs  of the Employment and Training Administration, Department of Labor;  the social insurance programs of the Social Security Administration  and the Health Care Financing Administration, Department of Health and  Human Services; the Federal income tax program of the Internal Revenue  Service, Department of the Treasury; the veterans benefit programs of  the Department of Veterans Affairs; and the military payroll systems  of the Department of Defense.  The two most important sources of  census data are the censuses of agriculture and of population.  (BEA  uses little survey data to prepare the State and local area estimates;  however, the Department of Agriculture makes extensive use of surveys  to prepare the State farm income estimates and the county cash  receipts and crop production estimates that BEA uses in the derivation  of the farm income components of personal income.)  The data obtained  from administrative records and censuses are used to estimate about 90  percent of personal income.  Data of lesser scope and relevance are  used for the remaining 10 percent.     When data are not available in time to be incorporated into the  current estimating cycle, interim estimates are prepared using the  previous year's State or county distribution.  The interim estimates  are revised during the next estimating cycle to incorporate the newly  available data.        Using data that are not primarily designed for income measurement has  several advantages and disadvantages.  Using administrative record  data and census data, BEA can prepare the estimates of State and local  area personal income on an annual basis, in considerable detail, at  relatively low cost, and without increasing the reporting burden of  businesses and households.  However, because these data are not  designed primarily for income measurement, they often do not precisely  ""match"" the series being estimated and must be adjusted to compensate  for differences in content (definition and coverage) and geographic  detail.     3.3.4 Controls and the Allocation Procedure     The national estimates for most components of wages and salaries and  transfer payments, which together account for about 75 percent of  personal income, are based largely on the sum of subnational source  data, and the procedure used to prepare the State and county estimates  causes only minor changes to the source data.  For other components of  personal income, either detailed geographic coding is not available  for all source data, or more comprehensive and more reliable  information is available for the Nation than for States and counties.  For these reasons, the estimates of personal income are first  constructed at the national level.  The subnational estimates are  constructed as elements of the national totals, using the subnational  data.  Thus, the national estimates, with some adjustment for  definition, serve as the ""control"" for the State estimates, and the  State estimates, in turn, serve as controls for the county estimates.     The State estimates are made by allocating the national total for each  component of personal income to the States in proportion to each  State's share of a related economic series.  Similarly, the county  estimates are made, in somewhat less component detail, by allocating  the State total.  In some cases, the related series used for the  allocation may be a composite of several items (e.g., wages, tips, and  pay-in-kind) or the product of two items (e.g., average wages times  the number of employees).  In every case, the final estimating step  for each income estimate is its adjustment to the appropriate higher  level total.  This procedure is called the allocation procedure.     The allocation procedure, as used to estimate a component of State  personal income, is given by           Click  HERE  for graphic.              The source data that underlie the national estimates are frequently  more timely, detailed, and complete than the available State and  county data.  The use of the allocation procedure imparts some of  these aspects of the national estimates to the subnational estimates  and allows the use of subnational data that are related but that do  not always precisely match the series being estimated.  The use of  this procedure also yields an additive system wherein the county  estimates sum to the State totals and the State estimates sum to the  national total.     3.3.5. Place of Measurement     Personal income, by definition, is a measure of income received;  therefore, estimates of State and local area personal income should  reflect the residence of the income recipients.  However, the data  available for regional economic measurement are frequently recorded by  the recipients' place of work.  The data underlying the estimates can  be viewed as falling in four groups according to the place of  measurement.        (1) For the estimates of wages and salaries, other labor income, and  personal contributions for social insurance by employees, most of the  source data are reported by industry in the State and county in which  the employing establishment is located; therefore, these data are  recorded by place of work.  The estimates based on these data are,  subsequently adjusted to a place-of-residence basis for inclusion in  the personal income measure.  (2) For nonfarm proprietors' income and  personal contributions for social insurance by the self-employed, the  source data are reported by tax-filng address.  These data are largely  recorded by place of residence.  (3) For farm proprietors' income, the  source data are reported and recorded at the principal place of  production, which is usually the county in which the farm has most of  its land.  (4) For military reserve pay, rental income of persons  personal dividend income, personal interest income, transfer payments,  and personal contributions for supplementary medical insurance and for  veterans life insurance, the source data are reported and recorded by  the place of residence of the income recipients.     3.3.6 Sources and Methods for Annual State and County Income Estimates     3.3.6.1 Framework     Personal income is estimated as the sum of its detailed components;  the major types of payments that comprise those components are shown  in Table 3.2, together with the related percents of personal income  and the principal sources of data used to estimate the components.  The following methodology presentation consists of a section for each  of the six types of payment and a section for the residence  adjustment.  The methodologies for some types of payment and for many  of the individual income components are omitted from this  presentation, but a complete presentation is available (BEA 1991, pp.  M-7-27).     3.3.6.2 Wage and salary disbursements     Wage and salary disbursements, which accounted for about 58 percent of  total personal income at the national level in 1990, are defined as  the monetary remuneration of employees, including the compensation of  corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; and receipts in  kind that represent income to the recipient.  They are measured before  deductions, such as social security contributions and union dues.  The  estimates reflect the amount of wages and salaries disbursed during  the current period, regardless of when they were earned.     The following description of the procedures used in making the  estimates of wage and salary disbursements is divided into three  sections: Wages and salaries that are covered under the unemployment  insurance (UI) program, wages and salaries that are not covered under  the UI program, and wages and salaries that are paid in kind.        Wages and salaries covered by the UI program     The estimates of about 95 percent of wages and salaries are derived  from tabulations by the State employment security agencies (ESA's)  from their State employment security reports (form ES-202).  These  tabulations summarize the data from the quarterly UI contribution  reports filed with a State ESA by the employers subject to that  State's UI laws.  Employers usually submit reports for each ""county  reporting unit""--i.e., for the sum of all the employer's  establishments in a county for each industry.  However, in some cases,  an employer may group very small establishments in a single  ""statewide"" report without a county designation.  Each quarter, the  various State ESA's submit the ES-202 tabulations on magnetic tape to  the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which provides a duplicate tape  to BEA.  The tabulations present monthly employment and quarterly  wages for each county in Standard Industrial Classification four-digit  detail.  (The ES-202 tabulations through 1987 reflect the 1972 SIC,  and those for 1988-90, the 1987 SIC.)  Under the reporting  requirements of most State UI laws, wages include bonuses, tips,  gratuities, and the cash value of meals and lodging supplied by the  employer.     The BEA estimates of wage and salary disbursements are made, with a  few exceptions, at the SIC two-digit level.  However, the availability  of the ES-202 data in SIC four-digit detail facilitates the detection  of errors and anomalies; this detail also makes it possible to isolate  those SIC three-digit industries for which UI coverage is too  incomplete to form a reliable basis for the estimates.  In this case,  the SIC two-digit estimate is prepared as the sum of two pieces: The  fully covered, portion, which is based on the ES-202 data, and the  incompletely covered portion, which is estimated as described in the  section on wages and salaries not covered by the UI program.     The ES-202 wage and data do not precisely meet the statistical and  conceptual requirements for BEA's personal income estimates.  Consequently, the data must be adjusted.  to meet the requirements  more closely.  The adjustments affect both the industrial and  geographic patterns of the State and county UI-based wage estimates.     Adjustment for statewide reporting.--Wages and salaries reported for  statewide units are allocated to counties in proportion to the  distribution of the wages and salaries reported by county; the  allocations for each State are made for each private-sector industry  (generally at the SIC two-digit level) and for five government  components.     Adjustment for industry nonclassification.--The industry detail of the  ES-202 tabulations regularly shows minor amounts of payroll that have  not been assigned to any industry.  For each State and county, the  amount of ES-202 payrolls in this category is distributed among the  industries in direct proportion to the industry-classified payrolls.     Misreporting adjustment.--This adjustment--the addition of estimates  of wages and salaries subject to UI reporting that employers do not  report--is made to the ES-202 data for all covered private-sector  industries.  At the national level, the estimate for each industry is  made in two parts--one for the underreporting of payrolls on UI  reports filed by employers and one for the payrolls of employers that  fail to file Ul reports (Parker, 1984).  The source data necessary to  replicate this methodology below the national level are not available.  Instead, the national adjustment for each industry is allocated to  States and counties in proportion to ES-202 payrolls.     Adjustments to government components.--Alternative source data are  substituted for the ES-202 data when the latter series reflects  excessively large proportions of Federal civilian payrolls that are  not reported by county or of State government payrolls that are  apparently reported in the wrong counties.  For Federal civilian wages  and salaries, the alternative source data are tabulations of  employment by agency and county prepared by the Office of Personnel  Management.  For State government wages and salaries, the alternative  source data are place-of-work wage data derived from an unpublished  tabulation of journey-to-work (JTW data from the 1980 Census of  Population.  (All income estimates using 1980 Census of Population  data will be updated to incorporate 1990 Census of Population data in  a regional comprehensive revision to be released in the spring of  1994.)     Adjustments for noncovered elements of UI-covered industries.--BEA  presently makes adjustments for the following noncovered elements:       0 Tips;       0 Commissions received by insurance solicitors and real estate agents;       0 Payrolls of electric railroads, railroad carrier affiliates, and railway labor organizations;       0 Salaries of corporate officers in Washington State;       0 Payrolls of nonprofit organizations exempt from UI coverage  because they have fewer than four employees;.       0 Wages and salaries of students employed by the institutions of  higher education in         which they are enrolled;       0 Allowances paid to Federal civilian employees in selected  occupations for         uniforms; and       0 Salaries of State and local government elected officials and  members of the judiciary.     Except for tips, these elements are exempted from State UI coverage.  Tips are covered by the various UI laws.  BEA assumes that this form  of income payment is considerably underreported, and it therefore  makes additional estimates of tips in industries where tipping is most  customary.     National and State estimates of each of the noncovered elements are  made (based on either direct data or indirect indicators).  These  estimates are added to the ES-202 payroll amount for the industry of  the noncovered element to produce the final estimates for that  industry.  Because of the lack of relevant data, county estimates are  made by allocating the final State total by the distribution of ES-202  payrolls for the appropriate industry.           Wages and salaries not covered by the UI program     Eight industries are treated as noncovered in making the State and  county estimates of wage and salary disbursements: (1) Farms, (2) farm  labor contractors, (3) railroads, (4) private elementary and secondary  schools, (5) religious membership organizations, (6), private  households, (7) military, and (8) ""other.""  The estimates for these  industries are based on a variety of sources.  For example, the  estimates for railroads ar based mainly on employment data provided by  the Association of American Railroads, and the estimates for the  military services are based mainly on payroll data provided by the  Department of Defense.  See BEA (1991) for the methodology for the  noncovered industries.     Wages and salaries paid in kind     The value of food, lodging, clothing, and miscellaneous goods and  services furnished to employees by their employers as payment, in part  or in full, for services perfomed is included in the wage and salary  component of personal income and is referred to as ""pay-in-kind.""  The  estimates for UI-covered industries are prepared as an integral part  of total wages and salaries for those industries, based on the ES-202  data.  The estimates for most on the noncovered industries are based  on pertinent employment data.  See BEA (1991) for the methodology for  pay-in-kind.     3.3-6.3 Other labor income     Other labor income (OLI), which accounted for about 5.5 percent of  total personal income at the national level in 1990, consists  primarily of employer contributions to private pension and welfare  funds; these employer contributions account for approximately 98  percent of OLI.  The ""all other"" component of OLI consists of  directors' fees, judicial fees, and compensation of prisoners.  Employer contributions for social insurance, which are paid into  govemment-administered funds, are not included in OLI; under national  income and product account conventions, it is the benefits paid from  social insurance funds--which are classified as transfer  payments--that are measured as part of personal income, not the  employer contributions to the funds.     Employer contributions to private pension and welfare funds     Private pension and profit-sharing funds, group health and life  insurance, and supp1emental unemployment insurance.--The larger part  of the national estimates of employer contributions to private pension  and welfare funds is developed from Internal Revenue Service  tabulations of data from proprietorship and corporate income tax  returns published in Statistics of Income.  However, these data are  not suitable for making the subnational estimates because most  multiestablishment corporations file tax returns on a companywide  basis instead of for each establishment and because the State in which  a corporation's principal office is located is often different from  the State of its other establishments.  As a result, the geographic  distribution of the data tabulated from the tax returns does not  necessarily reflect the place of work of the employees on whose behalf  the contributions are made.     For private-sector employees, the State and county estimates of  employer contributions to private pension and profit-sharing funds,  group health and life insurance, and supplemental unemployment  insurance are made, for all types of employer contributions combined,  at the SIC two-digit level, the same level of industrial detail as the  wage and salary estimates.  The national total of employer  contributions for each industry is allocated to the States and  counties in proportion to the estimates of wage and salary  disbursements for the corresponding industry.  The use of subnational  wage estimates to allocate the national estimates of employer  contributions to private pension and welfare funds is based on the  assumption that the relationship of contributions to payrolls for each  industry is the same at the national, State, and county levels.  The  procedure reflects the wide variation in contribution rates--relative  to payrolls--among industries (and therefore reflects appropriately  the various mixes of industries among States and counties).  It does  not reflect the variation in contribution rates among States and  counties for a given industry.     The Federal Government makes contributions to a private pension fund,  called the Thrift Savings Plan, on behalf of its civilian employees  who participate in the Federal Employees Retirement System (mainly  employees hired after 1983).  In the absence of direct data below the  national level, the national estimate is allocated to States and  counties in proportion to the estimates of Federal civilian wages and  salaries.     State government contributions to private pension plans consist of  annuity payments made by State governments on behalf of selected  employee groups--primarily teachers.  The State estimates are based on  direct data from the Teachers Insurance and Annuity  Association/College Retirement Equities Fund.  The county estimates  are prepared by allocating the State estimates in proportion to the  estimates of State and local government education wages and salaries.     In the absence of direct data below the national level, the national  estimates of Federal, State, and local government contributions to  private welfare funds on behalf of their employees are allocated to  States and counties in proportion to ES-202 employment data for each  level of government.     Privately administered workers' compensation.--The State estimates for  this subcomponent are based mainly on direct data provided by the  National Council on Compensation insurance and by the Social Security  Administration; the county estimates for each SIC two-digit industry  reflect the geographic distribution of wages and salaries.  The  methodology for this income component is given in BEA (1991).              ""All other"" OLI     The methodology for ""all other"" OLI--primarily directors' fees and  jury and witness fees--is given in BEA (1991).  The State and county  estimates for directors' fees--the largest of these  subcomponents--reflect the geographic distribution of wages and  salaries in each industry.     3.3.6.4 Proprietors' Income     Proprietors' income, which accounted for about 8.5 percent of total  personal income at the national level in 1990, is the income,  including income-in-kind, of sole proprietorships and partnerships and  of tax-exempt cooperatives.  The imputed net rental income of  owner-occupants of farm dwellings is included.  Dividends and monetary  interest received by proprietors of nonfinancial business, monetary  rental income received by persons who are not primarily engaged in the  real estate business, and the imputed net rental income of  owner-occupants of nonfarm dwellings are excluded; these incomes are  included in dividends, net interest, and rental income of persons.  Proprietors' income, which is treated in its entirety as received by  individuals, is estimated in two parts--nonfarm and farm.     Nonfarm prorrietgrt' income     Nonfarm proprietors' income is the income received by nonfarm sole  proprietorships and partnerships and by tax-exempt cooperatives.  The  State and county estimates of the income of sole proprietors and  partnerships for all but three of the SIC two-digit industries are  based on 1981-83 tabulations from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form  1040, Schedule C (for sole proprietors), and form 1065 (for  partnerships).  Tabulations either of gross receipts or of profit less  loss from the two forms combined are used either to attribute a  national total to the States or as direct data.  Two national totals  are used for each industry: One for income reported on the income tax  returns as adjusted to conform with national income and product  accounting conventions--and one for an estimate of the income not  reported on tax returns.     For the adjustments for unreported income, no direct data are  available below the national level.  The national total for each  industry is attributed to States in proportion to the IRS State  distribution of gross receipts for the industry.  For the reported  portion of nonfarm proprietors' income, the State estimates for each  of 45 industries are based on the IRS distribution of profit less loss  for the industry, and the estimates for each of another 20 industries  (together accounting for 3 percent of total nonfarm proprietors'  income) are based on the IRS distribution of gross receipts for the  industry.  For the latter group, the ERS distribution of profit less  loss, although preferable in concept, is not used as a basis for State  estimates because the extreme year-to-year volatility of the State  data suggests that they are unreliable.     The 1983 State estimates prepared by the foregoing methodology are  extended to later years based mainly on the number of small  establishments in each industry as determined from the Census Bureau's  County Business Patterns; see BEA (1989) for a full description of the  methodology.        For the three remaining industries, limited partners' income presents  a special estimating problem.  In these industries--crude petroleum  and natural gas extraction, real estate, and holding and investment  companies--limited partnerships are often used as tax shelters.  Limited partners' participation in partnerships is often purely  financial; their participation more closely resembles that of  investors than that of working partners.  Accordingly, the usual  assumption that the State from which the partnership files its tax  return is the same as the residence of the individual partners is  unsatisfactory.  No direct data on the income of partners by their  place of residence are available.  The national estimates of  proprietors' income for these industries are attributed to States in  the same proportion as dividends received by individuals (based on  all-industry dividends reported on IRS form 1040).     The State estimates of the income of tax-exempt cooperatives are based  on data provided by the Rural Electrification Administration (for  electric and telephone cooperatives) and the Agricultural Cooperative  Service (for farm supply and marketing cooperatives); see BEA (1989)  for the methodology.     The methodology for the county estimates of nonfarm proprietors'  income is similar to the State methodology, but less direct data are  used for many industries because problems with data volatility are  greater at the county level.  See BEA (1991) for a full description of  the county methodology.     Farm proprietors' income     The estimation of farm proprietors' income starts with the computation  of the realized net income of all farms, which is derived as farm  gross receipts less production expenses.  This measure is then  modified to reflect current production through a change-in-inventory  adjustment and to exclude the income of corporate farms and salaries  paid to corporate officers.  Tables showing the derivation of State  and county farm proprietors' income in detail are available from the  Regional Economic Information System.     The concepts underlying the national and State BEA estimates of farm  income are generally the same as those underlying the national and  State farm income estimates of the U.S. Department of Agriculture  (USDA).  The major definitional difference between the two sets of  estimates relates to corporate farms.  The USDA totals include net  income of corporate farms, whereas the BEA personal income series,  which measures farm proprietors' net income, by definition excludes  corporate farms.  Additionally, BEA classifies the salaries of  officers of corporate farms as part of farm wages and salaries; USDA  treats the corporate officers' salaries as returns to corporate  ownership and as part of the total return to farm operators.     The State control totals for the BEA county estimates of farm  proprietors' income are taken from the component detail of the USDA  State estimates, which are modified to reflect BEA definitions and to  include interfarm intrastate sales.        The methods used to estimate farm proprietors' income at the county  level rely heavily on data obtained from the 1974, 1978, and 1982  censuses of agriculture and on selected annual county data prepared by  the State offices affiliated with the National Agricultural Statistics  Service (NASS), USDA. (Data from the 1987 Census of Agriculture will  be incorporated into the estimates with the next cycle of  comprehensive revisions.)  The NASS data, which are described by Iwig  in Chapter 7 of this report, are used, wherever possible, to  interpolate and extrapolate to noncensus years.  In addition, data  from other sources within USDA, such as the Agricultural Stabilization  and Conservation Service, are used to prepare a fairly detailed income  and expense statement covering all farms in the State and county.     For census years, BEA prepares county estimates of 46 components of  gross income and 13 categories of production expenses.  For  intercensal and postcensus years, the component detail of the  estimates for each State is set to take advantage of the best annual  county data available for the State.     Farm gross income includes estimates for the following items: (1) The  cash receipts from farm marketing of crops and livestock (in component  detail); (2) the income from other farm-related activities, including  recreational services, forest products, and custom-feeding services  performed by farm operators; (3) the payments to farmers under several  government payment programs; (4) the value of farm products produced  and consumed on farms; (5) the gross rental value of farm dwellings;  and (6) the value of the net change in the physical volume of farm  inventories of crops and livestock.     Cash receipts from marketing is the most important component of farm  gross income.  The USDA generally has annual production, marketing,  and price data available for preparing the State estimates for about  150 different commodities.  However, annual county estimates of cash  receipts--usually for total crops and for total livestock--are  currently available for only 19 States (BEA 1991, fn. 15, p. M-14).  For the other States, the USDA State estimates of cash receipts from  the marketing of individual commodities are summed into the 13 crop  and 5 livestock groups for which value-of-sales data are reported by  county in the censuses of agriculture.  The aggregates for the census  years are then allocated by the related census county distributions.  Estimates for intercensal years are based on supplemental county  estimates of annual production of selected field crops and on State  season average prices available from the State NASS offices, or they  are calculated by straight-line interpolation between the census years  and adjusted to State USDA levels.     The county estimates of the remaining components of gross income, of  production expenses, of the adjustment for interfarm intrastate  transactions, and of the adjustment to exclude the income of corporate  farms are based mainly on data from the censuses of agriculture and  data provided by NASS and by the Agricultural Stabilization and  Conservation Service.  See BEA (1991) for a full description of the  methodology.           3.3.6.5 Personal Dividend Income, Personal Interest Income, and  Rental Income of Persons     These components accounted for more than 17 percent of total personal  income in 1990.  Dividends are payments in cash or other assets,  excluding stock, by corporations organized for profit to noncorporate  stockholders who are U.S. residents.  Interest is the monetary and d  imputed interest income of persons from all sources.  Imputed interest  represents the excess of income received by financial intermediaries  from funds entrusted to them by persons over income disbursed by these  intermediaries to persons.  Part of imputed interest reflects the  value of financial services rendered without charge to persons by  depository institutions.  The remainder is the property income held by  life insurance companies and private noinsured pension funds on the  account of persons; one example is the additions to Policyholder  reserves held by life insurance companies.     Rental income of persons consists of the monetary income of persons  (except those primarily engaged in the real estate business) from the  rental of real property (including mobile homes); the royalties  received by persons from patents, copyrights, and rights to natural  resources; and the imputed net rental income of owner-occupants of  nonfarm dwellings.     The State and county estimates of dividends, interest, and rent are  based mainly on data tabulated from Federal individual income tax  returns by the Internal Revenue Service.  The methodology for  dividends, interest, and rent is given in BEA (1991).     3.3.6.6 Transfer payments     Transfer payments are payments to persons, generally in monetary form,  for which they do not render current services.  As a component of  personal income, they are payments by government and business to  individuals and nonprofit institutions.  Nationally, transfer payments  accounted for almost 15 percent of total personal income in 1990.  At  the county level, approximately 75 percent of total transfer, payments  are estimated on the basis of directly reported data.  The remaining  25 percent are estimated on the basis of indirect, but generally  reliable, data.     For the State and county estimates, approximately 50 subcomponents of  transfer payments are independently estimated using the best data  available for each subcomponent.  The methodology for all of these  subcomponents is given in BEA (1991); the following items are  presented here as examples.     Old-age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI) payments.--These  payments, popularly known as social security, consist of the total  cash benefits paid during the year, including monthly benefits paid to  retired workers, dependents, and survivors and special payments to  persons 72 years of age and over; lump-sum payments to survivors; and  disability payments to workers and their dependents.  The State  estimates of each OASDI segment are based on Social Security  Administration (SSA) tabulations of calendar year payments.  The  county estimates of total OASDI benefits are based on SSA tabulations  of the amount of monthly benefits paid to those in current-payment  status on December 31, by county of residence of the beneficiaries.     Medical vendor payments.--These are mainly payments made through  intermediaries for care provided to individuals under the federally  assisted State-administered medicaid program.  Payments made under the  general assistance medical programs of State and local governments are  also included.  The county estimates are based on available payments  data from the various State departments of social services.  For  States where no county data are available, the county estimates are  based on the distribution of payments made under the aid to families  with dependent children program.     Aid to families with depenndent children (AFDC).--This  State-administered program receives Federal matching funds to provide  payments to needy families.  The State estimates are based on  unpublished quarterly payments data provided by the SSA.  The county  estimates are prepared from payments data provided by the various  State departments of social services.  County data are no longer being  received from some State for these States, the most recent available  data are used for the county estimates for each subsequent year.     State unemployment compensation.--These are the cash benefits,  including special benefits authorized by Federal legislation for  periods of high unemployment, from State-administered unemployment  insurance (UI) programs.  Most States report benefits directly by  county, but a few report by local district office.  In the latter  case, local district office data are distributed among the counties  within the jurisdiction of the local district office in proportion to  the annual average number of unemployed persons estimated by the  Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).  When the State is unable to supply  the county data in time to meet the publication deadline, a  preliminary set of estimates is made and is revised the following year  to incorporate the delayed county data.  The preliminary county  estimates are prepared by extrapolating the preceding year's estimates  forward by the change in the BLS estimate of the annual average number  of unemployed persons.     Veterans life insurance benefit payments.--These are the claims paid  to beneficiaries and the dividends paid to policyholders from the five  veterans life insurance programs administered by the Department of  Veterans Affairs.  The county allocations of the combined payments of  death benefits and dividends are based on the distribution of the  veteran population.     Interest payments on guaranteed student loans.--These are the payments  to commercial lending institutions on behalf of individuals who  receive low-interest deferred-payment loans from these institutions to  pay the expenses of higher education.  The State estimates are based  on Department of Education data on the number of persons enrolled in  institutions of higher education.  The county allocations are based on  the distribution of the civilian population.           3.3.6.6 Personal Contributions For Social Insurance     Personal contributions for social insurance are the contributions made  by individuals under the various social insurance programs.  These  contributions are excluded from personal income by treating them as  explicit deductions.  Payments by employees and the self-employed for  social security, medicare, and government employees' retirement are  included in this component.  Also included are the contributions that  are made by persons participating in the veterans life insurance  program and in the supplementary medical insurance portion of the  medicare program.     The State and county estimates of personal contributions for social  insurance are generally based either on direct data from the  administering agency or on the geographic distribution of the  appropriate earnings component; see BEA (1989 and 1991) for the full  methodologies.     3.3.6.7 Residence Adjustment     Personal income is a ""place-of-residence"" measure of income, but the  source data for the components that compose more than 60 percent of  personal income are recorded by place of work.  The adjustment of the  estimates of these components to a place-of-residence basis is the  subject of this section.     At the national level, place of residence is an issue only for border  workers (mainly those living in the United States and working in  Canada or Mexico and vice versa).  At the State and county levels, the  issue of place of residence is more significant.  Individuals  commuting to work between States are a major factor where metropolitan  areas extend across State boundaries--for example, the Washington,  DC-MD-VA MSA.  Individuals commuting between counties are a major  factor in every multicounty metropolitan area and in many  nonmetropolitan areas.     BEA's concept of residence as it relates to personal income refers to  where the income to be measured is received rather than to ""usual,""  ""permanent,"" or ""legal"" residence.  It differs from the Census  Bureau's concept mainly in the treatment of migrant workers.  The  decennial census counts many of these workers at their usual place of  residence rather than where they are on April 1 when the census is  taken.  Except for out-of-State workers in Alaska (where migrant  workers are unusually important) and for certain groups of border  workers, BEA assigns the wages of migrant workers to the area in which  they reside while performing the work.  Similarly, BEA assigns the  income of military personnel to the county in which they reside while  on military assignment, not to the county in which they consider  themselves to be permanent or legal residents.  Thus, in the State and  local area personal income series, the income of military personnel on  foreign assignment is excluded because their residence is outside of  the territorial limits of the United States.     Three of the six major components of personal income are recorded, or  are treated as if recorded, on a place-of-residence (where-received)  basis.  They are transfer payments; personal dividend income, personal  interest income, and rental income of persons; and proprietors,  income.  Nonfarm proprietors' income is treated as income recorded on  a place-of-residence basis because the source data for almost all of  this part of proprietors' income are reported to the IRS by tax-filing  address, which is usually the filer's place of residence.  The source  data for farm proprietors' income are recorded by place of production,  which is usually in the same county as the proprietor's place of  residence.     The remaining three major components--wages and salaries, other labor  income (OLI), and personal contributions for social insurance--are  estimated, with minor exceptions, from data that are recorded by place  of work (point of disbursement).  The sum of these components (wages  plus OLI minus contributions) is referred to as ""income subject to  adjustment"" (ISA).        Residence adjustment procedure (excluding border workers     The county residence adjustment estimates for 1981 and later years are  based on those for 1980 because intercounty commuting data are  available only from the decennial censuses of population.  (Data from  the 1990 Census of Population will be introduced into the residence  adjustment estimates as part of the comprehensive revisions to the  State and local area personal income estimates that are now underway.)  The estimation of these adjustments can be understood using the  example of a two-county area comprising counties f and g.  The  two-county example is easily generalized to more complex situations.           Click  HERE  for graphic.        data from the 1980 Census of Population on the number of wage and  salary workers (W) and on their average earnings (E) by county of work  for each county of residence:        Click  HERE  for graphic.        The initial 1980 BEA estimates were modified in three situations.  First, for clusters of counties identified as being closely related by  commuting (mostly multicounty metropolitan areas), modifications were  made to incorporate the 1979 wage and salary distribution from the  1980 Census of Population.  The 1979 wage and salary distribution from  the 1980 Census of Population reflects the residential distribution of  the income recipients as of April 1, 1980, regardless of where they  were living when they received the wages and salaries.)  These  modifications are needed because in numerous cases the 1980-census JTW  data and the source data for the BEA wage estimates are inconsistently  coded by place of work.  (For example, the source data may attribute  too much of the wages of a multiestablishment firm to the county of  the firm's main office, or the geographic coding of the Defense  Department payroll data and of the JTW data may attribute a military  base extending across county boundaries to different counties.)  Initial county estimates of place-of-residence wages and salaries were  derived as place-of-work wages and salaries plus net residence  adjustment for wages and salaries.  (For the calculation of this net  residence adjustment, only the gross flows for wages and salaries were  used.)  Then, the initial 1980 BEA place-of-residence wage and salary  estimates were summed to a total for each cluster.  Finally, the BEA  total for each cluster was redistributed among the counties of the  cluster in the same proportion as the 1979 wage and salary  distribution from the 1980 census.  To facilitate the extension of the  1980 residence adjustment estimates to later years, the cluster-based  modifications--derived as net additions to or subtractions from the  initial residence adjustment estimates for each of the 1,287  counties--were expressed as gross flows between pairs of counties  within the same cluster.  In the simplest case--a two-county  cluster--the additional gross flow was assumed to be from the county  with the negative modification to the county with the (exactly  offsetting) positive modification.     Second, modifications were made for selected noncluster adjacent  counties if large, offsetting differences occurred between the initial  1980 BEA estimates and the census wage data for these counties.  These  adjacent-county modifications were expressed as gross flows in the  same way and for the same reason as the cluster-based modifications.     Third, modifications were made for eight Alaska county equivalents  (boroughs and census areas) to reflect the large amounts of labor  earnings received by seasonal workers from out of State.  The  1980-census JTW data reflect the ""commuting"" of many of these workers,  and the initial 1980 residence adjustment estimates for a majority of  the county equivalents did not require modifications.  However, for  eight county equivalents, the initial 1979 estimates yielded BEA  place-of-residence wage and salary totals that were so much higher  than the comparable census data that the could not be an accurate  reflection of the wages of only the permanent residents.  The 1979  residence adjustment estimates, although based mainly on the  1980-census JTW data, also reflect--at the appropriate one-tenth  weight--1970-census JTW data.)  Based on the assumption that the  excess amounts were attributable to out-of-State migrant workers,  these amounts were removed by judgmentauy increasing the JTW-based  gross flows to the large metropolitan counties of Washington, Oregon,  and California.        Click  HERE  for graphic.        Click  HERE  for graphic.     As a last step, the total place-of-residence ISA OSA plus net  residence adjustment) for each cluster is derived and then distributed  to the counties of the cluster based on 1980 place-of-residence ISA  extrapolated to later years by the percentage change in the IRS-based  wage series.  The net residence adjustment, estimate for each cluster  county is calculated as place-of-residence ISA minus place-of-work  ISA.        3.4 Evaluation Practices     In the past few years, two major studies were undertaken by BEA to  evaluate the State and local area income estimates: (1) a reliability  study of the State quarterly personal income series and (2) a study of  the accuracy of the county residence adjustment estimates.  In  addition, In March of this year, the U.S. General Accounting Office  (GAO) completed a study of BEA's national and State estimates.     3.4.1 Evaluation of the State Quarterly Personal Income Series     This study provided a detailed measurement and analysis of the  reliability of quarterly and annual estimates of State personal income  (Brown and Stehle 1990).  The study, which covered the State estimates  from 1980-87, assessed the reliability of State quarterly personal  income using several statistical measures to examine the size of the  revisions made to the estimates.  One measure used analyzes the range  of revisions, where revision is defined as the percent change in the  final estimates minus the percent change in the preliminary estimates.  Other sets of measures used were dispersion, relative dispersion,  bias, and relative bias.  The findings of the study were intended to:  (1) help BEA isolate particular problem areas in the production of  these estimates; and (2) help users of these data determine the  suitability for their purposes of the estimates released at different  stages of the estimating process.  The four principle findings of the  study were: (1) the major sources of the revisions to the quarterly  percent changes in the preliminary quarterly estimates of State  personal income are farm proprietors' income and wages and salaries;  (2) largely reflecting wages and salaries, the preliminary quarterly  estimates of total personal income tend to be underestimated in  fast-growing States and overestimated in slow-growing States; (3)  beginning in 1984, the reliability of the second quarterly estimates  (that is, the estimates yielded by the first routine revision) was  improved by the incorporation of quarterly data from employers'  payroll tax reports (the ES-202 data), and (4) the annual revisions of  total personal income are smaller than the quarterly revisions.     3.4.2 Residence Adjustment Reliability Study     In October 1988, a study was completed which measured the reliability  of the Census commuting data used to prepare the net residence  adjustments for county personal income (Zabronsky 1988).  While the  impact of the residence adjustments are generally small at the region  and State level, the residence adjustments constitute a large portion  of total personal income for most counties in the U.S.  In 1989 for  instance, the absolute value of the net residence adjustments  accounted for about 12.5 percent of total personal income for all  counties, on average, while accounting for about 25 percent of total  personal income in metropolitan area counties, on average.        In this residence adjustment reliability study, a comparison of a  Census file of county commuting data constructed from the  journey-to-work question on the 1980 decennial census was made with a  file of aggregate wages and salaries independently tabulated by  Census.  In the course of the study, comparisons between  thejourney-to-work and aggregate wage series were explored across a  variety of geographic demographic, and industrial detail to develop a  comprehensive reliability profile for the census commuting data.     The major conclusion of this study was that taking the 1980 Census  aggregate income series as a benchmark measure of county wages and  salary income, the 1980 census journey-to-work data proved to be a  highly reliable source for measuring commuter's income in the  development of BEA's county residence adjustment estimates.  Although  careful analysis of the Census journey-to-work wage data did reveal a  bias in that series that was correlated with county size, wage  amputations undertaken by BEA largely corrected the problem while  commuting patterns between counties indicated that for the relevant  comparisons, the Census journey-to-work data were consistent with the  Census aggregate income-based wage series.     3.4.3 GAO Study of BEA's State and National Estimates     The GAO study (GAO, 1993) was conducted in response to a request by  the Honorable Ernest F. Hollings, Chairman, Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation, U.S. Senate.  Senator Hollings expressed  concern about press reports that alleged that BEA ""did not  incorporate, for political purposes, a downward revision of original  employment levels into its October 1991 estimate of first quarter 1991  State personal income growth and its December 1991 estimate of first  quarter 1991 gross domestic product (GDP) growth.  The report  concluded that ""We found no evidence that BEA manipulated first  quarter 1991 personal income or GDP estimates for political purposes.  BEA generally followed its standard procedures for using employment  data in these estimates and deviated from these procedures only when  required by what we believe were reasonable technical judgments"" (GAO,  1993, p. 1)        3.5 Current Problems and Activities     BEA's regular publication schedules are carefully developed to take  into account the needs of users, balanced against the responsibility  to produce data of high quality.  In general, the four-month lag of  the State quarterly and preliminary annual State personal income data  and the eight-month lag in the release of more detailed annual State  personal income estimates are timely enough for most purposes and  cause few hardships for the users of these series.     For county and metropolitan area data, the fifteen-month lag required  to produce these estimates is considered too long for many purposes  and has limited the usefulness of these data.  In an effort to address  the issue of the timeliness of its local area estimates, BEA has  recently been testing the feasibility of developing preliminary annual  estimates of personal income for metropolitan areas and  non-metropolitan portions of States.  These estimates would be  available with a seven-month lag.           3.6 Conclusions     Rapid advances in computer technologies continue to provide  improvements in the range of regional data available for local area  estimation as well as in the timing of their availability.  For  example, the more timely availability of ES-202 wage and salary data  coupled with BEA's improved computing capabilities and estimating  procedures may allow for the much more timely release of preliminary  income estimates for metropolitan areas.     These rapid advances in computer technologies also continue to expand  the ease of data transfer, storage, and manipulation.  For example,  BEA recently introduced a CD-ROM containing the local area personal  income estimates; many data users can now acquire the entire set of  estimates rather than placing an order each time they need some of the  data.  As in the past, it is anticipated that these advances in  electronic capabilities will continue to expand the uses and users of  BEA's regional estimates.                 Table 3. 1: Programs Using BEA Personal Income Estimates in Allocation Formulas  for Federal Domestic Assistance Funds, Fiscal Year 1992      Program            Program                       FY 1992 Obligations   Number              Name                           (Millions of $)   ---------------------------------------------------------------------   17.235         Senior Community Service                395.2                  Employment Program      84.126         Rehabilitation Services               1,783.5      84.154         Public Library Construction              29.8                  and Technology Enhancement      93.020         Family Support Payments to           13,814.9                  States (AFDC)      93.138         Protection and Advocacy for              19.1                  Mentally Ill Individuals      93.630         Developmental Disabilities               90.2                  Basic Support and Advocacy      93.645         Child-Welfare Services--State           273.9                  Grants      93.658         Foster Care--Title IV-E               2,342.1      93.659         Adoption Assistance                     201.9      93.778         Medical Assistance Program           72,502.7                  (Medicaid; Title XIX)      93.779         Health Care Financing Research           78.4      93.992         Alcohol & Drug Abuse & Mental           292.0                  Health Services      TOTAL                                               92,823.7      ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Source:   Office of Management and Budget and U.S. General Services            Administration (1992), 1992 Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance,            Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing office.

Long, U. S. Bureau of the Census     4.1 Introduction and Program History     The U. S. Bureau of the Census produces population estimates for the  nation, states, counties, and places (cities, towns, and townships) as  part of its program to quantify changes in population size and  distribution since the last census.  These estimates provide updates  to the population counts by demographic and geographic characteristics  from the last census.  They also indicate the pace of population  change since the last census and the relative influence of the  components of population change.  While the national estimates can be  produced by a careful accounting system that adds annual births,  deaths, and international migration to the previous year's population,  subnational estimates require development of methods for dealing with  the largely unmeasured component effects of internal migration.  Many  of these methods represent the type of small domain estimates that  constitute the subject of this working paper.     4.1.1 Uses of postcensal population estimates     There are five major categories of uses for the Census Bureau's  population estimates: 1) Federal and state funds allocation, 2)  denominators for vital rates and per capita time series, 3) survey  controls, 4) administrative planning and marketing guidance, and 5)  descriptive and analytical studies (Table 4.1).  More than 70 federal  programs distribute tens or billions of dollars annually on the basis  of population estimates (GAO, 1990).  Even more money was distributed  indirectly on the basis of indicators which used population estimates  for denominators or controls (GAO, 1991).  Many states also use the  postcensal subnational estimates to allocate state funds to counties,  townships, and incorporated places within the state.     A large number of Federal statistical series including state and  county per capita income, national and state birth and death rates,  and county level cancer rates by age, sex, and race use the results of  the postcensal estimates.  While many Federal agencies directly  collect time series data on events and amounts, they require annual  postcensal estimates of state and county population to produce per  capita rates.  These series provide an indication of national and  subnational trends for fertility and mortality rates, incidence of  cancer and other diseases, per capita economic changes, and other  social, demographic, and administrative indicators.     Population surveys require independent controls from national  population estimates by age, sex, race, and ethnicity as well as data  on the geographic distribution of the population by states and  selected metropolitan areas.  These estimates are used to weight the  sample cases such that the survey results equal the postcensal  estimates used as controls.  Each of the major surveys conducted by  the Census Bureau control to somewhat different levels of geographic  and demographic detail (Table 4.2).  There are a number of reasons to  control surveys to independent estimates.  They were initially  instituted to reduce the variance of the survey estimates.  They are  also used for a number of secondary reasons: reduction in month-to-  month variability of longitudinal data from consecutive surveys,  partial correction for the large rates of undercoverage of surveys  relative to the census, and improved consistency between different  surveys and other population data series based on independent  estimates.     There are numerous other administrative and analytical uses of the  postcensal population estunates.  They provide the only regular  mechanism by which the components of population change are combined to  track changes in the size and demographic and geographic distribution  of the nation's population.  The postcensal estimates provide  essential information for administration and planning in the  government and private sectors.  In addition, they are used as a  standard by state and local governments and the private sector in  producing their own population estimates for smaller scale geography  or for greater social and economic detail.     4.1.2 History or Census Bureau estimates program     Since the early 1900s, the Census Bureau has produced national  population estimates.  The methodology for these estimates developed  into a component method in which the measured components of population  change (births, deaths, immigration, and emigration) are added to or,  in the case of deaths, subtracted from the most recent decennial  census to estimate the current population.     When the Census Bureau attempted state population estimates beginning  in the 1940s, it faced the difficult prospect of adding internal  migration to the other components of population change.  Since annual  measures of internal migration by state are not available, many  attempts were made to develop other ways to estimate state population  change.     Through 1960, the principal method (known as Component Method II) was  to estimate net migration based on annual changes in school,  enrollment.  In the 1960s, a second method was added that estimated  changes in the population level rather than measuring the components  of population change.  This method (the ratio-correlation method) uses  regression analysis that relates changes in selected independent  variables to changes in state population since the last census.  These  independent variables come from federal or state data sources.  In the  1960s, the major proxy variables were vital events, school enrollment,  tax returns, number of votes cast, motor vehicle registrations, and  building permits.  In the 1970s, the variables for votes cast and  building permits were dropped and a variable for the size of the work  force was added.     As the demand for estimates spread to the county level, the Federal  State Cooperative Program for Population Estimates was formed to  involve state governments in a joint effort with the Census Bureau.  This organization permitted the extension of Component Method II, the  ratio correlation method, and a housing unit method to the county  level by providing data on school enrollment and various state  administrative data systems at the county level.  This system  permitted the flexibility of using data sets selected for each  individual state.     The enactment of General Revenue Sharing created a demand for  population estimates for all general purpose governments(incorporated  places, towns, and townships).  To estimate these subcounty areas the  Census Bureau returned to a component based method (the administrative  record methoo)'in which migration was estimated using income tax data  from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  This method required  matching addresses on successive years of tax returns and calculating  a migration rate based on the total number of exemptions that moved  into and out of each area.  The key challenge in developing this  methodology was to design a suitable method of coding mailing  addresses to counties, incorporated places and minor civil divisions.  The result was a probability coding guide based on a question on place  of residence placed on the tax returns in selected years.  This  methodology proved so successful that it was added as an independent  method in the estimation of state and county populations as well.        4.2  Program Description, Policies, and Practices     The level or geographic and characteristic detail and the  methodologies or the current population estimates program are legacies  of the expansion of estimates demands during the last three decades.  Tables 4.3 and 4.4 show the frequency, detail, and methodology used at  each geographic level of the Census Bureau's population estimates  program.     While the national population is estimated by age, sex, race, and  Hispanic Origin, the subnational population estimates vary greatly in  demographic and socioeconomic detail.  In general, the level of  characteristic detail declines as the level of geography becomes  finer.  Each level of geography also has its own combination of  methods and input data.  State population is currently produced on an  annual basis by age and sex.  County estimates are produced annually  for the total population and, on an experimental basis, by age, race,  and sex.  Estimates for the total population of metropolitan areas are  produced annually by summing the appropriate county data and by making  adjustments for New England areas which are composed of townships  rather than counties.  Every other year, the Census Bureau produces  total population estimates for incorporated places, towns, and  townships.        4.3 Estimator Documentation     The methodology for postcensal estimates varies by level of geography  with the widest array of methods used in county estimates.  This  methodological discussion focusses on the county estimates with  occasional extensions to include methods specific to states or places.  Postcensal population estimates update the last census population  based on changes in the population or in components of population  change.  Actual information on such components of population, change  as births and deaths or on changes in symptomatic indicators related  to changes in the population since the last census provide benchmarks  to anchor the estimates.     The art of postcensal estimation of population comes in choosing  appropriate benchmarks (or auxiliary data) to use in estimating the  population change since the last census.  One type of benchmark data,  population flow data, consists of measures of the components of  population change (eg. births, deaths, internal and external  migration).  The other type of benchmark data, population stock data,  includes indicators that are correlated with population size an uses  changes in those indicators to estimate the total change in  population.  Methods based on each of these two classes of data are  found in several variations in the Census Bureau's postcensal  population estimates program.     4.3.1 Flow methods     Flow methods are also known as component methods.  They require some  estimation of each of the components of population change since the  last census.  In the most general form, the component method reduces  to a basic accounting equation for population change.           Click  HERE  for graphic.           (IRS) for changes in filing addresses between two consecutive annual  tax filings (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1988).  In the estimates  process, tax returns from one year are matched with those from  previous years by matching Social Security numbers of the filers.  For  persons with a new address, the new mailing address is coded to state,  place, and county.  If the state, place, or county is different from  the previous year, the filer and all exemptions are classified as  migrants.  These data are then used to construct net migration rates  for each county and place as an input to the population estimation  formula.  An estimate of the rate of net migration is calculated by  dividing the net flow of exemptions (the tax filer plus his or her  dependents) moving into the area by the number of exemptions filed in  the area (See equation 4.2).        Click  HERE  for graphic.        This net migration rate is then multiplied by the initial population  as shown in equation 4.1.  A critical assumption in this method is  that the population not covered by the administrative data set moves  similarly to the population covered or that the uncovered population  is too small to affect the results markedly.  Since this assumption is  especially inappropriate for the population over 65 and for certain  military and institutionalized populations, those populations are  handled separately as explained below.  Other potential problems  include the difficulty of coding addresses to geography, changes in  administrative coverage over time, and the elimination of  administrative data sources as governmental programs change.           Click  HERE  for graphic.        migration rate of the school-aged population in the most recent  census.  The critical assumption here is that the  relationship of net school-aged migration and net total migration  remains constant over time.     4.3.2 Change in Stock Methods     A fundamentally different approach to population estimates emphasizes  the total change in population size since the last census rather than  demographic components of change.  These change in stock methods  relate changes in population size to changes in other measured  variables that are assumed to be correlated with population change.     The choice of possible variables is wide: number of housing units,  automobile registrations, total number of deaths (and or births), tax  returns, etc.  Note that births and deaths in this method are not  viewed as components but as indicators of the size of the population.  Similarly, drivers licenses and tax returns are not used as indicators  of migration as they were in the flow methods but as proxies for the  size of the total population.           Click  HERE  for graphic.        Click  HERE  for graphic.           The key assumption in this method is that the relationship among  geographic units between change in population and change in the  selected indicator variables remains constant over time (Tayman and  Schafer, 1985).  Complications also arise if indicator variables  change over time in selected areas for reasons unrelated to population  -- for example, changes in the tax law, changes in general fertility  rates, increases in automobile registrations per person, etc.     Another population stock method used to estimate the ratio of the  current population to the household change is the housing unit method.  In this method, tax rolls, construction permits, certificates of  occupancy, or utility data could be used to calculate changes in the  number of housing units in an area (Smith and Mandell, 1984).  In the  Census Bureau's methodology the housing stock from the last Census is  updated using data on housing construction, demolitions, and  conversions (Eq. 4.4).              Click  HERE  for graphic.           The number of households in area i for date t is estimated by  multiplying the estimated number of housing units at time t by an  updated estimate of the occupancy rate for area i at time t.  By  assuming that the local occupancy rate changes as the national rate,  we can update the area's rate by multiplying the occupancy rate for  area i at the time of the census by the ratio of the national  occupancy rate at time t from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to  the national occupancy rate at the time of the census.           Click  HERE  for graphic.           Finally, the population for the area i is calculated by multiplying  the area's household estimate by an updated estimate of population per  household.  Again we assume that the area's population per household  from the last census can be updated by multiplying by the ratio of the  national population per household from the CPS to the national  population per household in the last census.           Click  HERE  for graphic.           All of the methods discussed so far refer to the household population  under 65.  The two other segments of the population, the population 65  and over and the group quarters population, are measured by their own  specific change in stock methodologies.  Since these two groups have  unique characteristics (especially in terms of their migration  patterns), we use administrative, records systems that are unique to  each of the two groups.  The population over 65 is estimated by using  changes in the medicare population since the last census as a direct  measure of the change in the population 65 and over.  No such  nationwide systems exists for the group quarters populations (defined  for estimates purposes as the population in military barracks, college  dormitories, prisons and other institutions).  Changes in these  population since the last census are obtained from an inventory of  major group quarters locations that is maintained and annually updated  by a special data collection process in the Population Estimates  Branch of the Population Division in cooperation with state agencies  affiliated with the Federal-State Cooperative Program for Population  Estimates.     4.3.3 Combined methods     The U.S. Census Bureau's postcensal population estimates program  combines methods in two ways.  Within each level of geography (states,  counties, and places) several of the above methods are combined (Table  4.4).  Since certain methods represent given subpopulations better, a  combination of methods may be viewed as more robust -- less likely to  change due to extraneous factors that might affect one or the other of  the estimates.  There is a further mixing of methods since the  estimates at each level of geography are controlled to the results of  the estimates made at the next higher level of geography.     The methodology for making state estimates during the 1980s averaged  the results of the administrative record method with those of the  composite method.  In the composite method, the population is divided  into three age groups, each of which is estimated by a separate  method.  The population under 15 is estimated using changes in the  levels of school enrollment (similar to Component Method II).  The  population ages 15-64 is estimated by a ratio- correlation method in  which the independent variables are tax returns, school enrollment,  and housing units.  The population over 65 is estimated using a method  in which changes in the number of persons on medicare since the last  census date are added to the population aged 65 and over at the last  census (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1984).  The total state population  by age is then controlled to equal the estimated national population  age structure.     Annual county population estimates are produced independently for each  state to coincide with the state's total population estimated above.  A distinct methodology for each state is developed in consultation  with that state's member of the Federal-State Cooperative Program for  Population Estimates.  In most cases, it consists of the average of  two or three of the methods described above: the administrative  records method, component method II, and the ratio-correlation method.  Moreover, within the ratio correlation method, different states use  different independent variables which may include school enrollment,  tax returns, medicare enrollment, automobile registrations, births,  deaths, dummy variables for county size, or other state-specific data  series.  Additional adjustments are made for changes in selected  military and institutional populations and for changes in the  population over 65.  Final results are controlled to the state  population estimate produced by the Census Bureau using a uniform  method across all states (van der Vate, 1988).     Place estimates use a strict administrative record methodology where  migration is based solely on the migration rates derived from changes  in addresses on tax returns.  The only other adjustments for place  estimates are for changes in selected military and institutional  populations and a final control to county level population estimates  (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1980).        4.4 Evaluation Practices     The estimation process demands continuous vigilance.  Methods that  appear to work well at the beginning of a decade may be unsatisfactory  later in the decade.  Only constant testing, data evaluation, quality  control, and checks for reasonableness can ensure a sound program of  population estimation.     Whatever the method of estimation chosen, a number of considerations  should be kept in mind, No matter how sophisticated the methodology,  the estimate will only be accurate if the underlying assumptions hold  and the input data are reliable.  Many things can happen to endanger  these conditions.  For example, the relationships that held between  variables in a previous decade might no longer hold in the current  decade.  The data series that one is depending upon to update the  population may deteriorate or fail to measure the same underlying  phenomenon as conditions change.  Even if the administrative or other  indicator data measure the population well, there may well be problems  of geographic coding that fail to assign the population to the correct  geography.     Finding an appropriate yardstick against which to measure the  postcensal population estimates is difficult.  During the decade,  aside from special censuses for a handful of places, there are no  suitable numbers to compare to the estimates -- thus we know little  about the short run accuracy of population estimates.  We can only  measure their accuracy at the extreme end of their range (after 10  years) using the next decennial census.  Even here, the changing level  of coverage between censuses for any given area can lead to  imprecision in our measurement of estimates accuracy.  Using the  results of the 1980 and 1990 censuses as enumerated, the Census Bureau  evaluated the accuracy of the population estimates program.  The  results (summarized in Table 4.5) show that population estimates made  for the nation, for states, and for counties were reasonably accurate,  but that estimates made for small places were quite inaccurate.  Estimates for places under 5,000 had a mean absolute error of more  than 15 percent while places over 50,000 had a mean absolute error of  less than 5 percent.        The last two columns in Table 4.5 present a more telling comparison.  Column two compares the 1990 census and the provisional 1990  postcensal estimate while column three compares the 1990 census with  the 1980 census.  For most levels of geography the postcensal  population estimate provides a far more accurate estimate than simply  holding the population constant at the level of the last census.  For  example, state postcensal estimates had an mean absolute error of only  1.5 percent, while holding the last census constant would give an  error of 10.0 percent.  On average, the estimates methodology is also  much better than using the last census for counties and incorporated  places over 5,000 population.  However, for many incorporated places  under 5,000, holding the population constant at the 1980 level would  have given more accurate results that did our postcensal estimate  program.     These inaccuracies for small places may be due to a number of sources:  The problem of coding administrative records to small units of  political geography, the greater importance of migration in population  change for small areas, and the greater likelihood that the broad  assumptions that might apply on average for larger areas would not  apply to small localities with very specific characteristics.  Since  the Census Bureau is required by law to produce data for all  incorporatedd places and townships, we will need to show places under  5,000 as well as the larger places for which we can produce good  estimates.  However, it is incumbent on us to show the uncertainty in  the estimates for small areas in future publications in addition to  making continual progress in refining and improving our estimates  methodologies and data bases.        4.5 Current Problems and Planned Activities     Many of the problems of the current population estimates system are  the results of its past success and rapid growth during the 1960s and  1970s.  Each new program, each expansion of characteristic detail,  each reduction in the size of geographic unit has been accompanied by  new data sets, by new methods, and by new production procedures.  Although the Census Bureau has done a good job of meeting users  expectations as these demands have increased, there is room for  improvement in the estimates methodology and operations.     We have embarked on a set of seven initiatives to revamp the  population estimates program and lead it into the next century.  These  initiatives fall under the following headings: 1) defining the  mission, 2) methodological integration, 3) input data quality, 4)  geographic flexibility, 5) characteristic detail, 6) analysis of  trends, and 7) production efficiency.        4.5.1 Defining the Mission     The products currently estimated by the Census Bureau's Population  Estimates Program are the results of opportunities and legislative  requirements over a period of three decades.  We plan to reexamine the  demands for and uses of population estimates.  A thorough study of the  needs for population estimates and the Census Bureau's proper mission  in filling those needs is an initial priority.  We are currently  polling a number of our users -- Federal government agencies, the  Federal-State Cooperative Program members, private data vendors, and a  number of other groups to ascertain their needs for population  estimates.     Some of the suggestions received so far involve modifying the  population estimates program in order to produce more detailed  characteristic information at the state and county level.  We hope to  produce age, sex, race, and Hispanic Origin data for counties.  With  more research, we may also be able to produce the county-level data on  households -- number, size, and income -- that is currently demanded  by many users.  We are examining the feasibility of producing  estimates for larger places on a yearly basis and producing estimates  for other subcounty geography as well -- possibilities include census  tract aggregates, subareas within large cities, and (for some  purposes) Zip codes.     4.5.2 Methodological Integration     The many different methods of estimating population developed over the  past decades have resulted in a complex population estimates program.  The need now is to integrate these disparate methods into an orderly  system.  Traditionally, the various estimation models used at the  Bureau have been integrated by a simple averaging of the different  estimates at a given level of geography and by controlling the sum of  estimates at one level of geography to the averaged estimate at the  next higher level.     The time has come to reexamine each set of methods for suitability as  parts of an integrated, parsimonious model for producing population  estimates.  In order to discuss methods of integrating our current  methods, it is useful to distinguish between methods that measure the  changes in the population stock and those that measure the components  of population change.  Methods showing the change in population stock  (the ratio correlation method, the medicare change methodology, and  the change in group quarters population) use changes in proxy  variables since the last census to produce estimates of the total net  change since the last census.  These methods permit the use of many  symptomatic measures of population size that may not be amenable to a  flow approach.        Component methods such as the administrative records method and  component method II represent flow methods in which the components of  population change births, deaths, international migration, and  internal migration are each measured separately and added to or  subtracted from the initial population.  The advantage of this type of  method is that it gives an estimate ont only of the population but  also of the components of population change.  This method provides  additional information about the reasons for change, the  reasonableness of the estimates, and provides inputs for population  projections.  Component methods are often preferable for larger areas  because they use relatively accurate counts of births and deaths to  compute a large part of population change.  Consequently,  administrative records which are often less accurate need only be used  to estimate the portion of population change due to migration.  Current research at the Census Bureau is underway to quantify the  relative effects of errors in each component on the final population  estimates.  For small area, these advantages disappear and change in  stock methods such as the housing unit method may be more appropriate.     As we integrate methods, we should be careful to retain the  flexibility offered by multiple independent methods of estimating  population.  Since methodologies for population estimates are  dependent upon the use of data sets collected for purposes other than  population estimates, the quality and availability of a given input  data set is never certain.  Only with multiple methods can we be  assured of the ability to produce population timely and reliable  population estimates.  Multiple methods also provide a necessary check  on the validity of the estimates results; surprising changes in  demographic trends can be checked using independent sources in order  to see if the results are merely idiosyncracies of a given input data  source.  The existence of independent methods of estimating population  could prove a distinct advantage in trying to gauge the accuracy of  estimates between censuses.  We should examine the potential of using  measures of divergence between independent estimates to determine the  reliability and degree of confidence we have in the accuracy of  postcensal estimates.  If three independent estimates give very close  values, we should have more confidence in those estimates than if the  estimates vary widely.     4.5.3 Input Data Quality     Perhaps even more important than the type of method chosen is the  choice of data set used in, the estimate.  Producing postcensal  population estimates requires integrating traditional ting traditional  demographic data sets such as census results, birth and death records,  and immigration statistics with nontraditional sources collected for  other administrative purposes such as tax returns, school enrollment,  drivers' licenses, housing construction, survey data, etc.  The art of  population estimation is to combine these traditional and  nontraditional sources to make maximum advantage of all the data  available.        The most challenging aspect of working with population estimates is  the use of data sets designed and collected for administrative  purposes rather than for statistical or demographic purposes.  Ideally, such data sets should have universal coverage, change in  direct relation with population changes, and be consistent over time  in content and form.  No data set actually meets these criteria.  The  level of population coverage is often less than 100 per cent.  Programmatic changes or changes in social behavior independent of  population change may affect the coverage rate.  Worst of all, the  administrative data set may even disappear if its programmatic need or  funding disappears.     Consequently, a healthy population estimates program requires careful  attention to the quality and timeliness of input data as well as to  the reliability of access to the input data.  This requires working  with our data providers to monitor the input databases on a number of  requirements including reliability, consistency, coverage,  characteristic detail, and idiosyncracies produced by programmatic and  other changes.  It also entails work with data producers to address  questions of mutual interest such as cost, confidentiality, and legal  requirements for data handling.  Since administrative datasets may  disappear over time, work must also continue on nurturing alternative  data sets to provide similar or superior data.  The need for  flexibility to address changing data set availability and quality is  yet another argument for using multiple independent methods and data  sets to provide redundancy in the estimates program.     4.5.4 Geographic Flexibility     Linking data on population to geography is the key to population  estimation methodology.  Any system for making subnational population  estimates must have a credible method for developing such geographic  correspondence.  Population estimates are required for legally defined  geographic entities such as counties and incorporated places and the  estimates methodology must take these requirements into account.  In  the county estimates conducted jointly with states under the  Federal-State Cooperative Program, we assume that the input data used  in the ratio correlation methodology systems are correctly coded by  county of residence.     In the administrative records method matching tax returns to determine  state, county, and place migration, the Census Bureau must provide the  geographic coding for movers based on the mailing addresses or filers  from the IRS tax forms.  In order to categorize these filers by county  and place of residence, the current methodology uses a probability  coding guide.  With the aid of data from a residence question on the  1980 tax form, mailing addresses were categorized by P.O. name, state,  zip code, and address type (street address, P. 0. box, RFD route) and  assigned a probability of falling within each of 3100 counties and  39000 places.        There are several problems that lead to deterioration in the coding  guide over time.  Some of the more obvious ones can be corrected by  manual adjustments in the coding guide, eg. creation of new Zip codes  or revised boundaries for old Zip codes, changes in the boundaries of  incorporated places, etc.  A key cause of deterioration that cannot be  fixed is the change over time in the distribution of the population  within a given address key (post office, state, Zip code, address type  combination).  To the extent that those changes in distribution cross  county, town, and city boundaries, the resulting coding will be  incorrect.  Moreover, the probability system itself may well put  individual persons in the wrong county or place.  We know little about  how these errors propagate through the system after several years and  multiple migrations.     The Census Bureau is currently developing a new geographic coding  system that permits frequent updating and, if possible, exact matching  rather than probability matching of addresses to geography.  The  system is based on the ""master address list"" proposed by the Census  Bureau's Geography Division as an outgrowth of the development of the  TIGER digitized mapping project and the ""address control file"" created  for use with the 1990 census.  This system would provide an annually  updated digitized data base that could place most addresses in the  United States into the appropriate census block (and thus into any  unit of geography that also has its boundaries in the TIGER system).  In the estimates area, we are exploring the feasibility of developing  a coding system that would code street addresses to subcounty areas  using such a master address list.  The existence of a continuously  updated master address list could provide far greater geographic  detail, ease of updating and correcting for boundary changes, and  flexibility in dealing with changing geographic concepts and shifts in  population distribution.     This methodology also provides the promise of a far greater benefit in  the future.  The ability to provide exact matching based on geography  might one day permit the matching of records on the basis of address  rather than an identifier such as social security number.  Such an  ability would provide the opportunity to bring far more information  sources to bear on the estimation effort.     4.5.5 Characteristic Detail     Another major area for innovation is the expansion of data on  population characteristics both demographic characteristics such as  age, race, and sex and social/economic characteristics such as  household structure and income.  In order to get a better hold on the  demographic structure of substate areas and to use as a denominator in  calculating incidence rates, there is a major increase in the demand  for age, race, and sex distributions at the county level between  censuses.  These data are not available from the IRS tax records that  form the principal part of our administrative records processing.  Consequently, we are developing alternative methods to provide these  data for counties and large places as an integral part of the  estimation process.     We have experimented with a number of possible approaches.  One of  these experimental programs developed a projected estimate by which  county trends in migration by age, race, and sex from the previous  decennial census were extrapolated into the current decade, added to  actual birth and death rates to produce a population by age, race, and  sex that was then controlled to the official estimate of total  population for a county.  Another experimental program extends the  current administrative record method by adding information by age,  race, and sex from Social Security records to a sample of IRS returns  to provide internal migration data for states and large metropolitan  areas.  Current plans call for integrating these programs into our  standard procedures by the mid 1990s.     There are also possibilities for using survey data combined with  administrative data to obtain characteristic information.  While  matched survey and administrative data records on an individual basis  may prove difficult, there have been efforts to combine data on an  aggregate basis.  A recent example is an analysis of internal  migration that combined aggregate data from the decennial census,  matched tax return migration data, and survey data from the Current  Population Survey (CPS) to provide a time series of migration by  characteristics for state to state flows.  Research is proceeding on  whether more information from surveys could be combined with the  administrative record methods by either aggregate or individual  statistical modeling approaches.     Another major effort is underway to produce estimates for housing  units and households for survey controls to the American Housing  Survey and other housing based surveys.  This program uses data on  additions and deletions from housing stock to update the housing  inventory from the decennial census.  While this method is similar to  the housing unit method for population estimates described above, the  resulting housing unit estimates are used directly as survey controls  rather than only used to estimate population.     There is also the potential for integrating more administrative data  into the estimates procedure.  A number of federal, state, and even  private data sets have been suggested.  Possible data sets include  state tax data, post office change of address forms, state drivers  license information, food stamp enrollment information, utility hookup  records, and telephone directory information.  These and other data  sets will be explored for their potential utility for, making  subnational estimates assuring proper attention is given to protection  of privacy and proper disclosure safeguards.           4.5.6 Analysis of Trends     A prime advantage of the population estimates programs is its  information on the changes in spatial population distribution between  censuses.  While the Census Bureau has put great emphasis on the  production of estimates for individual states, counties, and places we  have only occasionally provided the summary information on the broader  trends in population redistribution.  An analysis of population  redistribution trends between cities and suburbs, high and low density  areas, areas of high and low unemployment, and other analytical  categories should be an annual part of our activities.  In order to do  this, a simple first step is to classify counties by relevant  analytical characteristics so that such summaries could be a standard  part of our processing.  In addition, we plan an annual analytical  report on population distribution trends based on the entire range of  population estimates.     Much of the intermediate data on components of population change  (migration, births, deaths, numbers of housing units, etc) used in  constructing the population estimates is of analytical interest in its  own right.  These data should be developed as their own data products  and used to provide an analytical view of the dynamics of current  population change.  An integrated set of historically consistent data  series on births, deaths, international, and internal migration should  be developed for all major geographic areas for which population  estimates are produced.  As As a first step, we are producing a  consistent time series of population counts for all counties and for  cities over 25,000 from 1790 through 1990.     4.5.7 Production Efficiency     The uncoordinated and erratic growth pattern in the population  estimates area has had a substantial effect on production efficiency.  During the 1980s, delays in production and unreliable publication  dates have frequently resulted from the unwieldiness of the current  production process.  For the 1990s, we have streamlined the production  process as a result of more parsimonious methodologies and a more  focused set of products.  Many of our users repeatedly tell us that it  is more important to have a firm production date than to be too  optimistic in our timetables.  Efforts toward redesigning the  estimates product have as a major goal a firm production schedule with  realistic deadlines.  While considerable progress has been made on  this commitment, we expect to strive toward continuous improvement in  timeliness as well as reliability and cost reduction.              4.6 Conclusion     Postcensal population estimates are an integral part of the  U.S. statistical system combining census results with tabulations on  vital events, providing the population controls by which household  survey results can be weighted, and producing a continuous and  up-to-date time series of changing population size and distribution  between censuses.  These estimates are only possible with the creative  use of censuses, vital events, administrative data, and other  unconventional sources for estimating changes in population on a  timely basis.     As we approach the twenty-first century, the population estimates  program provides an ideal starting point for an integrated demographic  and social accounting system.  The system already unites the decennial  census and population survey results through a series of longitudinal  controls.  These longitudinal controls are based on previous censuses  and vital events, and could be modified to incorporate measurements of  undercoverage if desired.  In the 1990 census, the estimates system  provided substantial information for coverage improvement during the  operation of the census and in evaluating coverage after the results  were in.  The system provides the opportunity to integrate the results  of administrative records collected for other purposes to augment and  improve traditional demographic data.  Our efforts to integrate our  geographic coding with the decennial census data base (TIGER), to  maintain estimates of housing units and households as well as  population, and to use data on social and economic characteristics  from surveys in the estimation process take us beyond a purely  demographic system to an enhanced estimates program that could  eventually provide continuously updated data on many of the variables  now only measured by the census.  Moreover, such an integrated  estimates system could provide data on the components and rhythm of  population, housing, geographic, social, and economic change that no  individual data source can now provide.                       Table 4.1: USES OF CENSUS BUREAU POPULATION ESTIMATES     National    - Survey Controls    - National Social and Economic Series    - Descriptive and Analytical Studies    - Controls for Subnational Estimates     State    - Direct Federal Fund Allocation Formulas    - Indirect Federal Fund Allocation    - Denominators for Federal and Other Data Series    - Federal Regulatory Actions    - Survey Controls    - Descriptive and Analytical Studies    - Controls for Substate Estimates     Counties    - Fund Allocation by State Governments    - Denominators for Federal, State, and Other Data Series    - Regulatory Action by State Governments    - Guides for Government and Private Sector Planning    - Descriptive and Analytical Studies    - Federal Data Series    - Controls for Subcounty Estimates     Places    - Federal Block Grants    - Fund Allocation and Regulatory Actions by Federal and  State Governments    - Descriptive and Analytical Studies    - Government and Private Sector Planning    - Private Sector Marketing Efforts    - Base Data for Private Sector Data Development                 Click  HERE  for graphic.           Click  HERE  for graphic.           Click  HERE  for graphic.           Click  HERE  for graphic.                                          BIBLIOGRAPHY           Batutis, Michael J. 1991.

At  present, monthly employment and unemployment estimates are prepared,  for the 50 states and the District of Columbia, all Metropolitan  Statistical Areas (MSA's), all counties, and selected subcounty areas  for which data are required by legislation -- more than 5,300 areas.  The Current Population Survey (CPS), conducted by the Bureau of the  Census for the BLS, is the official survey instrument for measuring  the labor force in the United States.  The CPS sample provides direct  monthly survey estimates of employment and unemployment for the  nation, selected states and New York City and Los Angeles.  However,  the CPS sample is not sufficiently large in most states and substate  areas to provide reliable monthly estimates.  Therefore, methods are  used to combine data from other sources with current and historical  CPS sample estimates to produce monthly estimates of employment and  unemployment for the remaining states, the District of Columbia, and  substate areas.         The CPS began during the Great Depression as a project of the  Works Project Administration (WPA).  During and following World War  II, the need for unemployment data at the local level began to  develop.  A number of state and federal agencies began making  estimates using various procedures.  In 1950, the U.S. Department of  Labor's Bureau of Employment Security, in an attempt to standardize  the estimation methods, issued guidelines in a booklet: Techniques for  Estimating Unemployment.  In 1960, the Handbook Method on Estimating  Unemployment was issued.  This building block or accounting method for  developing total employment and unemployment estimates is essentially  still used for substate areas today.  About the same time, Congress  began passing legislation using local unemployment data for the  allocation of funds, such as the Area Redevelopment Act in 1961 and  the Public Works Economic Development Act in 1965.  Legislated  programs which currently allocate funds to states and local areas  based on unemployment estimates, include the ""Disadvantaged Adults and  Youths"", ""Summer Youth"", and ""Dislocated Workers""' programs of the Job  Training Partnership Act, the ""Emergency Food and Shelter Program"",  and the ""Public Works Program"".  In FY91, more than 9 billion dollars  in appropriations to states and local areas were based, in full or in  part, on local area unemployment statistics.         In 1972, the BLS acquired responsibility for, unemployment  statistics.  BLS subsequently introduced chnages to the Handbook  methodology, including the use of annual average estimates from the  CPS as controls for the state and area monthly estimates.  Beginning  in 1973, the CPS sample size was expanded to allow for direct sample  based estimates for the 10 largest states, Los Angeles and New York  City.  In 1984, an llth state was added.  The Handbook method was  still used for the 39 remaining states and the District of Columbia.  However, a 6-month moving average adjustment using CPS data was  applied to the state estimates.  For substate areas, Handbook  estimates are prepared for all labor market areas in the state, which  are controlled to the state CPS- based estimates of employment and  unemployment.  At present, monthly employment and unemployment  estimates are also prepared for all MSA'S, all counties, and selected  subcounty areas for which data are required by legislation.  In 1989,  a new methodology was introduced for producing monthly state  employment and unemployment statistics for the 39 smaller states and  the District of Columbia.  This method is a time-series regression  model, and uses a state-space Kalman filter approach.         Monthly estimates for the 39 smaller states and the District of  Columbia are published approximately 6 weeks after the reference week  of the CPS, which is the week including the 12th.  Sample based  estimates for the largest 11 states are released a few weeks earlier,  (usually the first Friday of the month following the reference month)  with the national estimates.  Estimates for the 39 smaller states and  the District of Columbia are revised a month later to reflect  revisions in the Unemployment Insurance Statistics and the Current  Employment Statistics (Payroll Employment Survey) Program, which are  used in both the Handbook Method and State Modeling Method.  At the  end of the year, monthly state estimates are revised (benchmarked) so  that their annual average equals the CPS sample based annual average.  For the 11 large, states, data are revised to reflect population  controls.        5.2 Program Description, Policies, and Practices            Only five labor force estimates are published monthly for state  and substate areas: Civilian noninstitutional population, civilian  labor force, employed, unemployed, and the unemployment rate.  Each  month a press release - The Employment Situation - is issued and the  Commissioner of Labor Statistics testifies before the Joint Economic  Committee of Congress.  The press release includes employment and  unemployment estimates for the 11 largest states, in addition to  national estimates.  These data, as well as data for the remaining 39  states, the District of Columbia and Metropolitan Statistical Areas  (MSAS) are published about four weeks later in Employment and  Earnings.  Seasonally adjusted data are provided for all 50 states and  the District of Columbia, beginning in January 1992.  Although the  data for the smaller states are published with the data for the 11  largest states, the data are published in two sets in a table.  The  estimating methodology for the smaller states is provided in a  footnote at the bottom of the page.  A separate monthly publication -  State and Metropolitan Unemployment - also includes data using direct  sample survey estimates for the 11 largest states, the State Model  methodology for the remaining states and the state CPS additively-  adjusted Handbook method for sub-state estimates.  This publication  provides more detailed estimates for sub-state areas.  In all, monthly  labor force estimates are provided for 5,300 areas, including  Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA's), Labor Market Areas (LMA's),  all counties (cities and towns in New England), and cities of 25,000  population or more.         Estimates for all but the 11 largest states, Los Angeles, and New  York City are revised a month following the initial publication in  which they appear, and again at the end of the year.  The first  revision takes into consideration revisions to the Payroll Employment  and Unemployment Insurance statistics.  The end of year revision  adjusts the monthly estimates such that their annual average equals  the CPS sample based annual average estimates for those states and  sub-state areas for which CPS data are provided.     5.2.1 Design or the Current Population Survey         The CPS monthly sample consists of 72,000 housing units.  This  sample size was chosen to meet national and state reliability  requirements.  Assuming a 6% unemployment rate, the national sample  size was chosen so that a month-to-month change of 0.2 percentage  points in the unemployment rate would be statistically significant at  the 90 percent confidence level.  This translates to a coefficient of  variation (CV) of 1.8% for the national unemployment rate.  The 11  largest states have a CV of 8.0% on the monthly unemployment rate.  Tbe other 39 states and the District of Columbia have a CV of 8.0% on  the annual average unemployment rate.  The CPS sample is located in  729 areas comprising over 1,000 counties and independent cities with  coverage in every state and the District of Columbia.  Prior to 1984,  the CPS had been designed as a national sample with the goal of  providing the best estimates of employment and unemployment for the  U.S. as a whole.         The CPS sample is selected by first dividing the entire area of  the United States into 1,973 primary sampling units (PSU's), where a  PSU is a county or a number of contiguous counties.  The 1,973 PSU's  are grouped into strata within each state.  One PSU is selected from  each stratum with probability of selection proportionate to the  population size of the PSU.  The most populated PSU's are grouped by  themselves and selected with certainty.  Since the sample design is  state based, the sampling ratio differs by state, ranging roughly from  1 in every 200 households to 1 in every 2500 households.  There are  several stages of selecting the household units within PSU'S.  First,  enumeration districts, which are administrative units and contain  about 300 housing units, are ordered so that the sample would reflect  the demographic and residential characteristics of the PSU.  Within  each enumeration district the housing units are sorted geographically  and are grouped into clusters of approximately four housing units.  A  systematic sample of these clusters of housing units is then selected.           Part of the sample is changed each month.  For each sample, eight  systematic subsamples (rotation groups) or segments are identified.  A  given rotation group is, interviewed for a total of 8 months -- 4  consecutive months in the survey, followed by 8 months out of the  survey, followed by 4 more consecutive months in the survey.  Under  this system, 75 percent of the sample segments are common from  month-to-month and 50 percent of the sample segments are common from  year-to- year.     The estimation procedures involves weighting the data from each sample  person by the inverse of the probability of the person being in the  sample.  These estimates are then adjusted for noninterviews, followed  by two ratio estimation procedures to adjust the CPS estimates to  known population totals.  The last step in the preparation of  estimates makes use of a composite estimating procedure.  The  composite estimate for the CPS is a weighted average of the estimate  for the current month and the estimate for the previous month,  adjusted for the net month-to-month change in households.     Balanced repeated replication and collapsed stratum methods are used  to estimate CPS variances for selected characteristics.  Generalized  variance functions are used to present the sampling error estimates in  publications.  Sampling error estimates are provided for all direct  sample based estimates, which include the annual average estimates for  states and some sub-state areas, as well as monthly estimates for the  11 largest states.  Error estimates are not provided for estimates  which use the State Model methodology or the Handbook methodology.  General variance functions are used for calculating sampling error  estimates for the direct sample based estimates from the CPS.  Employment and Earnings series provides methods for calculating  sampling error estimates for almost any estimate in the publication.  These methods can also be used to calculate estimates for unpublished  CPS estimates, such as the monthly unemployment rates for the smaller  states.  These sampling error estimates can be used to approximate the  error in the model based estimates.        5.3 Estimator Documentation        The method used to provide monthly state estimates for the 39 states  and the District of Columbia is based on the time series approach to  sample survey data.  Originally suggested by Scott and Smith (1974),  this approach treats the population values as stochastic and uses  signal extraction techniques developed in the time series literature  to improve on the direct survey estimator.  Recent work has been  conducted by Bell and Hillmer (1990), Binder and Dick (1990),  Pfefferman (1992), and Tiller (1992a).     The actual monthly CPS sample estimates are represented in signal plus  noise form as the sum of a stochastically varying true labor force  series (signal) and error (noise) generated by sampling only a portion  of the total population.  Issues related to non-sampling errors are  not considered by this approach.  The signal is represented by a time  series model that incorporates historical relationships in the monthly  CPS estimates along with auxiliary data from the Unemployment  Insurance (UI) and Current Employment Statistics (CES) programs.  This  time series model is combined with a noise model that reflects key  characteristics of the sampling error to produce estimates of the true  labor force values.  This estimator has been shown to be design  consistent under general conditions by Bell and Hillmer (1990) and is  optimal under the model assumptions.     Unlike the typical small area estimation application that seeks to  improve on the direct survey estimator by borrowing strength over  areas, the time series approach borrows strength over time for a given  area.  While variance reduction is a primary goal of both these  approaches, when there are strong overlaps in the sample design and  relatively long historical series are available, the time series  approach provides powerful tools for estimating the underlying  population values.  As discussed in the previous section, the CPS  design creates major sample overlaps resulting in very strong  autocorrelations in the sampling errors.  By combining a model of both  the true labor force values and the sampling error, the time series  approach controls for the autocorrelation induced by the sample design  making it easier to identify the population dynamics.  This is  particularly useful in trend analysis and seasonal adjustment.  When  sampling error is strongly autocorrelated, trend and sampling effects  are confounded in the observed data (Tiller, 1992b).        Click  HERE  for graphic.           Click  HERE  for graphic.           Seasonal Component          The seasonal component is the sum of six trigonometric terms  associated with the 12-month frequency and its five harmonics        Click  HERE  for graphic.     Irregular component        The irregular component is a residual not explained by the  regression or time series components discussed above.  The convention  in classical decomposition of a univariate time series is to represent  the irregular as a highly transient phenomena, i.e., as white noise or  a low order MA process.     Noise      The noise component of the observed CPS estimate represents  error that arises from sampling only a portion of the total  population.  Its structure depends upon the CPS design and population  characteristics.  For our purposes, we focus on those design features  that are likely to have a major effect on the variance-covariance  structure of the sampling error, e(t).         One of the most important features of the CPS is the large overlap  in sample units from month to month.  As described in the previous  section, units are partially replaced each month according to a 4-8-4  rotating panel.  Since this system produces large overlaps between  samples one month and one year apart, we can expect e(t) to be  strongly autocorrelated.  Also, there is likely to be some correlation  between nonidentical units in the same rotation group because of the  way in which new samples are generated.  When a cluster of housing  units permanently drops out of a rotation group, it is replaced by  nearby units.  Since the new units will have characteristics similar  to those being replaced, this will result in correlations between  nonidentical households in the same rotation group (Train, Cahoon, and  Makens, 1978).         Finally, the dynamics of the sample error will also be affected by  the composite estimator.  This is a weighted average of an estimate  based on the entire sample for the current month only and an estimate  which is a sum of the prior month composite and change that occurred  in the six rotation groups common to both months (Bureau of the  Census, 1978).  In effect, this estimator takes a weighted average of  sample data from the current and all previous months.         Another important feature of the CPS is its changing variance over  time.  There are three major sources of heteroscedasticity: (1) sample  redesigns; (2) changes in the sample size; and (3) changes in the true  value of the population characteristic of interest.  The first two  cause discrete shifts in, the sample variance.  For example, the CPS  is redesigned each decade to make use of decennial census data to  update the sampling frame and estimation procedures.  Most recently, a  state-based design was phased in during 1984/85 along with improved  procedures for noninterviews ratio adjustments and compositing.  Changes in state sample sizes have occurred more frequently than  redesigns and have had major effect on variances at the state level.  Even with a fixed design and sample size, the error variance will be  changing because it is a function of the size of the true labor force.  Since the labor force is both highly cyclical and seasonal, we can  expect the variance to follow a similar pattern.  To capture the  autocorrelated and heteroscedastic structure of e(t), we may express  it in multiplicative form (see Bell and Hillmer, 1990) as           Click  HERE  for graphic.           Click  HERE  for graphic.            The autocovariance structure may also change over time with  redesigns of the sample.  However, since the most important source of  autocorrelation is the 4-8-4 rotation scheme, which has not changed,  it seems reasonable to treat this structure as stable, at least,  between sample designs.         The application of the signal-plus-noise approach requires  information on the variance- covariance structure of the CPS at the  state level.  In principal this information can be estimated directly  from the sample unit data using conventional designed based methods.  In practice, this is not always feasible, since the CPS variance  estimation involves complex computations on large microdata files.  In  the initial implementation of models in 1989 for the 39 states and the  District of Columbia not enough information was available to  explicitly model the sampling error.  Instead, the noise component was  estimated as a correlated residual (Tiller, 1989).  More recently,  sampling error autocorrelations have been developed and new models are  being tested incorporating this information (Tiller, 1992a).     Estimation      The models described in the previous section are estimated using  the Kalman filter (KF).  The is a highly efficient algorithm for  estimating unobserved components of, a time series model, when that  model can be represented in state-space form.  The state-space form  consists of two sets of equations, transition and measurement  equations, and a set of initial conditions.  The unobserved signal and  noise components are collected into the state vector, Z(t).  The  transition equations represent the state vector as a first-order  vector-autoregressive process (VAR) with a normal and independently  distributed disturbance vector, v(t), which contains the white noise  disturbances        Click  HERE  for graphic.           associated with each of the unobserved component processes.  The  transition equations are set out below in a simplified form  appropriate for our specific application.            In the new models under development, the CPS error correlation  structure is estimated outside of the time series model from  design-based information.  Variances for the state CPS estimates are  computed using the method of generalized variances (Tiller, 1992).  Autocorrelations were derived in a study by Dempster and Hwang (1992).  In that study, state-specific variance component models were fit to a  time series of data for the 8 CPS rotation groups.  From the estimated  variance parameters, autocorrelations were derived and, then, ARMA  parameters were, estimated from these autocorrelations.        Click  HERE  for graphic.                   Once, an additional observation, y(t), becomes available, the  update equations revise the conditional moments with the new  information in that observation.        Click  HERE  for graphic.            To initialize these equations, it is necessary to specify starting  values for the conditional moments, Z(O) and P(O).  Those elements of  the state vector that are stationary, i.e., sampling error and the  irregular, are initialized with their unconditional moments.  The  nonstationary and nonstochastic state variables are initialized with  diffuse priors.         Together, the prediction and update equations constitute the KF.  The KF updates its latest prediction of the state vector with current  sample data, prepares a prediction for the next period and updates  that prediction when new sample data become available, but the  estimate of Z(t) will not be revised with data later than period t.  Thus, the KF estimator at time t is optimal only with respect to data  later than period t.  The estimator of Z(t) optimal for all  observations, before and after t, is known as a smoother.  By taking a  linear combination a forward and backward KF, which is the KF run in  reverse, starting at the end of the sample period at time t=T, and  preceding to the beginning, a Kalman (fixed interval) smoother (KS) is  obtained.  Let the backward filter prediction of the state vector at  time t, conditional on data from t+l to T be denoted by Z(t/t+l) and  its covariance by P(t/t+l).  The smoothed estimator is              Click  HERE  for graphic.               State agency staff prepare their official monthly estimates using  software developed by BLS that implements the KF.  This algorithm is  particularly well suited for the preparation of current estimates as  they become available each month.  Since it is a recursive data  processing algorithm, it does not require all previous data to be kept  in storage and reprocessed every time a new sample observation becomes  available.  All that is required is an estimate of the state vector  and its covariance matrix for the previous month.  The software is  interactive, querying users for their UI and CPS data and, then  combining these data with CPS estimates to produce model based  estimates.  At the end of the year, the monthly estimates are revised,  along with previous year estimates with the smoothing algorithm.           5.4 Evaluation Practices        Click  HERE  for graphic.           For each of the 39 states and the District of Columbia, signal plus  noise models of the CPS unemployment rate and employment level were  fit to monthly data beginning in 1976.  Each of the 80 models has been  subjected to a wide variety of statistical tests.     An analysis of the model's prediction errors is the primary tool for  assessing model adequacy.  The prediction errors are computed as the  difference between the current values of the CPS and the predictions  of the CPS made from the model based on data prior to the current  period.  Since these e errors represent movements not explained by the  model, they should not contain any systematic information about the  behavior of the signal or noise component of the CPS.  Specifically,  the prediction errors, when standardized, should approximate a  randomly-distributed variate with Zero mean and constant variance  (white noise).  The tests used to check the prediction errors for  departure from these properties included:     - General tests for non-zero correlations in the innovations  - Departures from white noise behavior at the seasonal frequencies  - Heteroscedasticity  - Non-nonmality  - Prediction bias     About 50 to 60 percent of the total variance in the monthly CPS series  is attributable to the estimated signal with the remainder due to the  aggregate noise term.  The time varying regression mean is  considerably smoother than the underlying CPS series.  Based on the  diagnostic tests, the 80 models appear to fit the systematic  underlying movements in the CPS fairly well.  The major problems with  the models were high autocorrelations in 11 states, and  heteroscedasticity in 9 of the 40 unemployment rate models.  The  heteroscedasticity is in part a reflection of changing variances (and  sample sizes) in the CPS.  Explicitly modeling the CPS sample errors  would alleviate this problem and is discussed in the current problems  and activities section, below.        The current state model estimates were introduced in January 1989.  The previous Handbook method could be classified as an accounting  method.  Several years of research and development, beginning in the  early 1980's, examined numerous regression and time series approaches  to replace the accounting method.  A number of workgroups were setup  to determine the criteria to be used to select the new methodology as  well as how to implement the new methodology.     Ongoing evaluation of models includes annual reassessment of the  regressor variables, if requested by staff in the state employment  security agencies.  Typically, state agency staff express concerns  with the models if either the month to month movements in the  unemployment rate estimates are larger than they expect or the  unemployment rate level seems unreasonable compared to other economic  dam.  Diagnostics tests, similar to the ones used for developing the  model, are run.  Adjustments to the regressor variables may be made if  the diagnostic indicate a problem with the model.  In this case  historical estimates would be replaced, in addition to developing a  new model for concurrent estimates.        5.5 Current Problems and Activities     The implementation of model estimates for states in January 1989  resulted, not unexpectedly, in estimates with more month to month  volatility than the previous Handbook method.  The previous method  incorporated a 6 month moving average, which limited month to month  movement.  The seasonal variation in the employment and unemployment  statistics series is usually large relative to the trend and cycle.  However, the BLS decided to conduct a research project to investigate  the issues of seasonally adjusting model based estimates prior to  implementing seasonally adjusted state estimates.  In November 1989, a  work group was formed to examine issues related to the seasonal  adjustment of estimates of employment level and unemployment rate for  the 39 smaller states and the District of Columbia (non-direct use  states).  The group was charged with addressing two primary areas:     1. Evaluation of the performance of the model estimates relative to  the CPS sample-based estimates, with emphasis on the trend/cycle  characteristics of the series.     2. Evaluation of the use and limitations of the BLS standard seasonal  adjustment method, X- 11 ARIMA, to seasonally adjust the model  estimates.     The evaluation of the modeling approach involved simulating a  reduction in reliability of direct-use CPS samples in 2 large states  (direct use -- Florida and Massachusetts) to nondirect-use levels,  fitting models to the resulting weakened series, and then comparing  model estimates to the CPS estimates from the full sample.  While it  would have been desirable to simulate sample cuts by subsampling the  original data, this was considered too costly.  Instead random noise  was added to the full sample estimates, using an estimated  variance/covariance structure of the CPS estimator.  For each state,  two weakened samples were generated for employment and unemployment,  and separate models were fitted to the full and weakened samples.  The  main findings are summarized as follows:              Model Evaluation     1. Modeling the weakened unemployment rate series resulted in  estimates which were closer to the full CPS sample than the unmodeled  weak CPS series for all four unemployment rate series.  Values for the  root mean squared relative difference (RMSRD) comparing full CPS to  model estimates were 28 to 38 percent smaller than values of RMSRD  comparing the full CPS to the weakened series.  Modeling also reduced  the number of weakened series estimates falling outside two standard  deviation intervals about the full sample estimates by 50 to 75  percent.     2. Modeling the weakened employment series resulted in modest, if any,  reductions in the RMSRD from the full CPS sample.  In one case for the  Florida employment series, the RMSRD values for the model were  actually larger than those for the weakened series.  This appeared to  be due primarily to the fact that the difference in reliability  between the full sample and the weakened series for employment was  very small compared to the difference for unemployment rate.     3. Modeling dramatically reduced the magnitude of irregular  fluctuation in both employment and unemployment rate.  It was not  unusual for the relative contribution of the variance of monthly  change in the CPS to be 4 to 8 times that of the modeled series.  The  much smoother quality of the model estimates have important  implications for seasonal adjustment (see below).     Evaluation of Seasonal Adjustment     Using X-11 ARIMA, the CPS and modeled series were seasonally adjusted.  The adequacy of the seasonal adjustment was evaluated using X-11 ARIMA  quality control statistics, spectral analysis, sliding spans, and  graphs of seasonal factors.  The major findings are as follows:     1. Tbe direct sample based unemployment rate CPS series could not be  adequately seasonally adjusted.  Frequently, several of the X-11 ARIMA  quality control statistics failed.  Seasonal adjustments had poor  stability properties, the seasonal variation could not be completely  removed, and distortion was added to the nonseasonal variation in the  series.  The results were better for the CPS employment series but not  nearly as good as for the modeled series.     2. The seasonal adjustments for all four of the employment and  unemployment model series appeared satisfactory.  Spectral analysis  shows that X-11 ARIMA was able to effectively remove seasonal  variation in the modeled series without introducing distortions in the  nonseasonal components of the series.  The sliding span statistics  indicate seasonal factors remain stable as the span of the data is  shifted across time.  In addition, monthly seasonal factors using the  model were similar to the seasonal factors of the full sample  estimates of the two direct-use states.  This indicates that the  models were not forcing an artificial pattern, but were ""picking up""  the seasonal pattern of the underlying CPS series, despite the extra  noise which was introduced.                In summary, despite some limitations to the methods of  evaluations, the study provided important information to help  understand the value of modeling and the use of X-11 ARIMA to  seasonally adjust model-based estimates; however, the theoretical base  for superimposing the modeling structure for X-11 ARIMA to already  smoothed, model based values remains to be explored.  Although the  study confirmed support for modeling, further work will be done to  demonstrate the utility of the employment models.          The BLS introduced seasonally adjusted state employment and  unemployment estimates beginning in January 1992, based on the results  of this study.          Current research is focusing on further reduction in irregular  movement in employment and unemployment models by introducing several  changes to the methods.  The most important change is the inclusion of  the variance/covariance structure of CPS estimates into the models,  rather than relying on the model to make these estimates (Tiller,  1992a).  Information on the structure of the CPS sample error is being  used to decompose the disturbance term into its sample error and model  error components.  Given CPS error variances and lag covariance, ARMA  models can be developed to approximate the time series behavior of the  sampling error.  Treating the ARMA coefficients as known parameters of  the state space system, standard time series diagnostic tools may be  used to model the errors in equation disturbances.  The need for  estimating the variance-covariance structure of the CPS estimates  stems from sample redesign and changes in sample size.          Other changes, such as removing some exogenous CPS variables, are  expected to improve the seasonal movements in the model estimates.  Florida and Massachusetts will again be used to examine the ability of  the weakened series to track the full sample CPS estimates.  Research  is expected to be completed in FY93 for implementation in January  1994.          Long term research will focus on substate estimation.  Hierarchical and Empirical Bayes methods may be considered in addition  to a time-series approach for substate estimates.  Spatial models,  which borrow strength from CPS sample data within the state, may be  appropriate for substate estimates.          A number of related studies have been conducted under the  auspices of other govemmental agencies.  The Census Bureau has  supported research by Bell and Hillmer (1990) that has been  instrumental in stimulating renewed interest in the time series  approach to survey estimation.  In this study, the authors applied  ARIMA models to retail survey data.  Binder and Dick (1990), at  Statistics Canada, fitted ARMA models to Canadian Labour Force survey  data.  Both of these studies estimated the sampling error structure  outside the time series model, using design-based methods.          Pffermann (1991) applied a structural time series model to  individual panel estimates from the Israeli labor force survey.  The  sampling error structure was estimated through the model rather than  by design-based methods.          Dempster and Hwang (1993) have developed prototype Bayesian  models for estimating U.S.  State employment and unemployment rates.  Their basic time series models are constructed from fractional  Gaussian noise processes.                                               REFERENCES          Bell, W.R. and Hillmer, S.C.

Iwig                    National Agricultural Statistics Service        6.1 Introduction and Program History     The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the  U.S. Department-of Agriculture (USDA) has published county estimates  of crop acreage, crop production, crop yield and livestock inventories  since 1917.  These estimates assist the agricultural community in  local agricultural decision making.  Also the Federal Crop Insurance  Corporation (FCIC) and the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation  Service (ASCS) of the USDA use NASS county crop yield estimates to  administer their programs involving payments to farmers if crop yields  are below certain levels.  The primary source of data for these  estimates has always been a large non-probability survey of  U.S. farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses who voluntarily provide  information on a confidential basis (see Chapter 7).  In addition, the  Census of Agriculture, conducted by the Bureau of the Census every  five years, serves as a valuable benchmark for the NASS county  estimates.     Earth resources satellite data, particularly from the Landsat series  of satellites, provide another useful ancillary data source for county  estimates of crop acreage.  The potential for improved estimation  accuracy using satellite data is based on the fact that, with adequate  coverage, all of the area within a county can be classified to a crop  or ground cover type.  The accuracy of the estimates is then dependent  on how accurately the satellite data are classified to each crop type  based on the ""ground truth"" data obtained from the annual June  Agricultural Survey (JAS) conducted by NASS.  Through the use of  aerial photographs, this survey identifies the crop type of individual  fields within randomly selected land segments.  Segments in major  agricultural areas are approximately one square mile in area and  normally contain 10 to 20 fields.  The satellite spectral data are  matched to the corresponding fields for use in classifying all  individual imaged areas, known as pixels, to a particular crop type.  Recent studies (Bellow 1991; Bellow and Graham 1992) have shown that,  for certain crops, approximately 80 percent of the pixels are  classified correctly.  This correct classification level is high  enough to provide improved estimation accuracy.        NASS has been a user of remote sensing products since the 1950's when  it began using mid- altitude aerial photography to construct, area  sampling frames (ASF's) for the 48 states of the continental United  States.  A new era in remote sensing began in 1972 with the launch of  the Landsat I earth-resource monitoring satellite.  Four additional  Landsats have been launched since 1972, with Landsat IV and V still in  operation in 1993.  The polar-orbiting Landsat satellites contain a  multi-spectral scanner (MSS) that measures reflected energy in four  bands of the electromagnetic spectrum for an area of just under one  acre.  The spectral bands were selected to be responsive to vegetation  characteristics.  In addition to the MSS sensor, Landsats IV and V  have a Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor which measures seven energy bands  and has increased spatial resolution.  The large area (185 by 170 km)  and repeat (16 day per satellite) coverage of these satellites opened  new areas of remote sensing research: large area crop inventories,  crop yields, land cover mapping, area frame stratification, and small  area crop cover estimation.     Research from 1972 to 1978 led to the creation of an operational  procedure for large area crop acreage estimation.  A regression  estimator was developed which related the ground-gathered area frame  data to the computer classification of Landsat MSS images.  The basic  regression approach used to produce State estimates does not produce  reliable county estimates.  Domain indirect regression estimators were  developed for this purpose.  In the 1978 crop season, corn and soybean  acreage State and county estimates based on remotely sensed data were  produced for Iowa.  One to two States were added to the project  through 1984.  For the 1984-1987 crop seasons, this project covered an  eight-State area in the central United States and produced regression  estimates of corn, winter wheat, soybeans, rice, and cotton acreages.  These regression estimates were combined with other survey indications  and administrative data to provide final published county estimates.  Estimation based on data from Landsat MSS sensors was discontinued in  1988 in order to implement the increased capabilities of higher  resolution sensors.     France entered the field of resources satellites in 1986 with the  launch of SPOT I, which carries an improved multi-spectral scanner.  This scanner images an even smaller area than the TM sensor but only  measures three energy bands.  Several NASS research projects compared  the SPOT MSS and Landsat TM sensors with respect to crop estimation.  This research led to the selection of Landsat TM as the preferred  sensor for crop area estimation based on its superior spectral  characteristics.  The spatial characteristics of the SPOT MSS sensor  provide a benefit only in areas with mostly small fields.     Regression estimation of crop acreages for large and small areas based  on computer classification was reinstated in 1991 with the Delta  Remote Sensing Project using Landsat Thematic Mapper data imaged over  the Mississippi Delta region, which is a major rice and cotton area.  Results from the operational eight-State program in 1987 and from  sensor comparison experiments showed that the regression approach was  most effective for rice and cotton estimation.  State and county  estimates of rice, cotton, and soybean acreages were produced for  Arkansas and Mississippi in 1991, with Louisiana added in 1992.  The  project only covers Arkansas in 1993 due to budgetary constraints.           Three domain indirect regression estimators have been used or  considered for producing small area county estimates using ancillary  satellite data.  From 1976 to 1982, the Huddleston-Ray estimator was  used (Appendix B).  In 1978, the Cardenas family of estimators was  considered but not implemented (Appendix C).  Beginning in 1982, the  Battese-Fuller family of estimators was used for calculating county  crop acreage estimates using Landsat MSS data.  Since 1991, the  Battese-Fuller model has been used to produce county estimates with  Landsat TM data.  Currently, this is the preferred model.  However,  non-regression estimation procedures based on total pixel counts are  being evaluated.     6.2 Program Description, Policies, and Practices     The basic element of Landsat spectral data is the set of measurements  taken by a sensor of a square area on the earth's surface.  The sensor  measures the amount of radiant energy reflected from the surface in  several bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.  The individual imaged  areas, known as pixels, are arrayed along east-west rows within the  185 kilometer wide north-to-south pass (swath) of the satellite.  For  purposes of easy data storage, the data within a swath are subdivided  into overlapping square blocks, called scenes.  The two satellites  currently in operation (Landsats IV and V) image a given point on the  earth's surface once every 16 days.  The MSS sensor, formerly used for  crop area estimation, contained four spectral bands with 80 meter  spatial resolution.  The more advanced TM sensor has seven bands  (three visible and four infrared) with 30 meter resolution.     Several Landsat scenes may be required to cover an entire region of  interest within a given State.  It is not always possible to have the  same image date for all such scenes due to schedule, cloud cover, and  image quality factors.  Consequently, analysis districts are created.  An analysis district is a collection of counties or parts of counties  contained in one or more Landsat scenes that have the same image date,  or in areas for which usable Landsat data is not available to the  analyst.  To obtain State level crop acreage estimates, NASS sums all  analysis district level estimates within the State.  County level  estimates are obtained using domain indirect regression and synthetic  estimation methods, to be discussed later.     The area sampling frame for each State is stratified based on land use  such as percentage cultivation, forest, and rangeland.  NASS uses the  regression estimator described by Cochran (1977, pp. 189-204) to  compute crop acreage estimates for each land use stratum within an  analysis district that has satellite coverage for an adequate number  of JAS segments.  These regression estimates are more precise than the  direct expansion estimates obtained from JAS data alone.  A detailed  description of the procedure involved is provided by Allen (1990).  Briefly, the steps required are as follows:     1.  A graphics oriented registration process associates Landsat pixels  with JAS sampled segments.     2.  JAS data for sampled segments are used to label each pixel within  the segments to a crop or other cover type.     3.  Labelled pixels are clustered based on their Landsat data values  to develop discriminant functions (signatures) for each cover     4.  The discriminant functions are used to classify each pixel within  the sampled segments to a cover type.     5.  The segment level classification results are used to develop  regression relationships for each crop between the ground and  satellite data within each land use stratum.  For each stratum, the  independent (regressor) variable is the number of pixels classified to  that crop per segment, and the dependent variable is the JAS segment  reported crop acreage.     6.  All pixels within the analysis district are classified, using the  discriminant functions developed in Step 3.     7.  For each stratum, the mean number of pixels per segment classified  for a given crop over all segments in the population is substituted  into the corresponding regression equation to obtain the stratum level  mean crop acreage per segment. This mean is multiplied by the known  total number of segments in the stratum to obtain the stratum level  crop acreage estimate.     8.  The stratum level estimates are summed to obtain the analysis  district level crop acreage estimate for the portion of the analysis  district covered by satellites data.     For land use strata lacking satellite coverage of an adequate number  of JAS segments to develop the regression relationship, the direct  expansion of JAS data is used to obtain estimates.  These stratum  level JAS estimates are also summed to obtain analysis district  estimates for each crop representing the area not covered by satellite  data.  The total analysis district estimate for a particular crop is  then:        Click  HERE  for graphic.        In many States, counties typically contain fewer than five sampled JAS  segments, and may contain no segments at all.  This fact makes it  generally infeasible to define analysis districts to be individual  counties and then use the above procedure to obtain county level  estimates.  Instead, the Huddleston-Ray, Cardenas, and Battese-Fuller  domain indirect regression estimators have been developed and  investigated for providing county estimates of crop acreage.  The  Battese-Fuller approach is currently favored by NASS, and is described  in detail in Section 6.3.     The NASS County Estimates system, described in Chapter 7, is designed  to accept the Battese-Fuller values as a separate set of county crop  acreage estimates.  Within this system, the Battese-Fuller county  estimates are first scaled to be additive to the official NASS State  estimate for each commodity.  The scaled Battese-Fuller values are  then composited with scaled values from other NASS surveys and  administrative data sources.  Thus the Battese-Fuller estimates serve  as an additional input to the County Estimates system in States where  they are available.  Currently, the composite weights are subjectively  set by the statisticians in the State office to provide satisfactory  and reliable estimates.  Each NASS State Statistical Office (SSO)  prepares their own annual publication of the final county estimates.  Although sampling variances are calculated for the Battese-Fuller  estimates, no variances or error information are published for the  final county estimates.  Mean squared error information is only  published for major agricultural items at the U.S. level.           6.3 Estimator Documentation     The Battese-Fuller family of estimators was first developed in the  general framework of linear models with nested error structure (Fuller  and Battese 1973), and later applied to the special case of county  crop area estimation (Battese, Harter, and Fuller 1988).  The method  has been used for all Landsat county estimation done by NASS since  1982.     Similar to the State level estimation, land use strata are separated  into those that have adequate satellite coverage and those that do  not.  The Battese-Fuller model can be applied within an analysis  district for all strata where classification and regression have been  performed.  The analyst computes stratum level Battese-Fuller acreage  estimates for all counties and subcounfies within the boundaries of  each analysis district.  For land use strata where regression cannot  be done due to lack of adequate satellite coverage or too few  segments, a domain indirect synthetic estimator is used to obtain  county estimates.           Click  HERE  for graphic.           Click  HERE  for graphic.           Click  HERE  for graphic.           Click  HERE  for graphic.           Click  HERE  for graphic.           Click  HERE  for graphic.           Click  HERE  for graphic.        was used within stratum A for the parts of counties outside the scene,  and in stratum B for all nine counties.     Table 2 gives the computed county estimates by stratum and estimation  method.  Table 3 contains the official county estimates issued by the  Iowa Agricultural Statistics Service.  These published estimates are  based on additional survey and administrative data (see Chapter 7),  and are considered as the standard for evaluating the Battese-Fuller  model values.  The tables show that the computed county estimates for  corn were more efficient overall than those for soybeans.  For eight  of the nine counties, the C.V. for corn was less than 4 percent.  No  county had a C.V.  of less than 4 percent for soybeans.  The percent  difference ranged from 0.2 to 9.2 for corn, and from 0.8 to 17.8 for  soybeans.              Table 2: Iowa 1988 County Estimates of Crop Acreage by Stratum and  Estimation Method              Stratum A       Stratum A     Stratum-B  County   Battese-Fuller  Synthetic     Synthetic      Total          C.V.        Corn     acres (000)     acres (000)   acres (000)    acres (000)  percent     Audubon       91.9           -              .3             92.2      3.5  Calhoun      130.3            2.6           .4            133.2      2.9  Carroll      140.7           -              .7            141.4      3.2  Crawford     128.4           23.4           .9            152.7      3.1  Greene       129.6           -              .4            130.0      3.0  Guthrie      105.7           -              .6            106.3      4.9  Ida           43.4           63.2           .4            107.0      3.7  Sac          137.5           -              .8            138.3      2.9  Shelby       140.2           -              .5            140.7      2.9  Total  1047.789.2  5.0  1141.8     Soybeans     Audubon       69.8           -              .1             69.9      6.6  Calhoun      143.2           1.7            .1            145.0      4.0  Carroll      106.6           -              .1            106.7      9.0  Crawford      91.3          15.5            .2            106.9      5.4  Greene       117.4           -              .1            117.5      4.6  Guthrie       64.3           -              .1             64.4     10.9  Ida           34.6          41.7            .1             76.4      6.9  Sac          112.8           -              .1            112.9      4.9  Shelby        80.9           -              .1             81.0      7.4  Total        820.9          58.8           1.0            880.7      6.5 Evaluation Practices     NASS first began to address the problem of applying satellite data to  small area estimation in the mid 1970's.  In 1976, Huddleston and Ray  (1976) proposed that within each stratum, the mean pixels per segment  calculated by classifying all segments within an entire analysis  district be replaced by the mean pixels per segment computed by  classifying all segments within a given county.  This county pixel  mean is substituted into the corresponding stratum regression equation  for the crop of interest.  Amis, Martin, McGuire, and Shen (1982)  describe the Huddleston-Ray estimator as an analysis district  regression estimator applied to a subarea of the analysis district.  The regression coefficients are estimated from sampled segments  located throughout the analysis district, while the mean being  estimated is from a subpopulation of the analysis district.  The  Huddleston-Ray estimator is simple and intuitively appealing, but  Walker and Sigman (1982) point out two major drawbacks.  First, it is  unclear how to accurately compute the variance of the estimator.  Second, the estimator lumps together a term attributable to sampling  error within a given county and another term that measures the  inherent distinction between a county and the analysis district.  Amis  et al. (1982) empirically demonstrate that the Huddleston-Ray method  can generate biased estimates and that the variance estimatation  formula can overestimate the variability for a given county.  The  mathematical formulas for the Huddleston-Ray estimator and its  variance estimator are provided in Appendix B.           The problems with the Huddleston-Ray estimator documented by Walker  and Sigman (1982) and by Amis et.al (1982) were recognized soon after  its development and prompted Cardenas, Blanchard, and Craig (1978) to  devise a different type of estimator.  The Cardenas family of  estimators has three forms, each of which uses auxiliary Landsat data,  through a regression type estimator.  However, the versions use  different methods of estimating the slope term.  The three forms are  the ratio estimator, the separate regression estimator, and the  combined regression estimator.  (Appendix C gives the mathematical  formulation for the Cardenas family of estimators.)  As with the  Huddleston-Ray method, within each stratum the Cardenas method  compares the analysis district level mean pixels per segment  classified to a crop to the corresponding county level mean for that  crop.  However, the Cardenas methods uses all segments in the analysis  district to calculate the analysis district mean, where the  Huddleston-Ray approach only uses sample segments.  The estimate of  average crop area per segment is adjusted by an amount proportional to  this difference between the county and analysis district means.  Amis  et al. (1982) examined the ratio and separate regression Cardenas  estimators, and compared them with the Huddleston-Ray estimator.  Cardenas et al. (1978) stated that none of the estimators they  presented were shown to be ""best"" in any sense, nor did they  demonstrate any optimum properties.  They did show that each of these  estimators, when summed over counties, provides an unbiased stratum  level estimate for the State.  Also, assuming that the within county  variance is the same for all counties, the method enables unbiased  estimation of the State-wide variance.  Amis et al. (1982) emphasized  that an unbiased estimate of the county mean crop area per segment may  not be possible when there are few sample segments in a county.  Whenever there are significant differences in county variances, the  Cardenas estimators appear to have higher variances than the  Huddleston-Ray estimator.  Amis et al. (1982) concluded that there  appears to be no difference between the Cardenas ratio estimator and  the separate regression estimator, and that the Cardenas estimators do  not perform better than the Huddleston-Ray estimator.  Both Cardenas  estimators studied appeared to be biased, with larger variances than  the Huddleston-Ray estimator.     The Cardenas method was never used in an operational remote sensing  program since it did not provide sufficient improvement over the  Huddleston-Ray estimator.  The Huddleston-Ray estimator was used to  generate county estimates for use by the NASS State Statistical  Offices (SSO's) until 1982.  At that time, Walker and Sigman (1982)  advised that calculation of county estimates using the Huddleston-Ray  method be discontinued, and that the Battese-Fuller method be used  instead.     Walker and Sigman (1982) studied the Battese-Fuller model using  Landsat MSS data over a six county region in eastern South Dakota.  They found a modest lack of fit of the model, with larger model  departure corresponding to low correlation between classified pixel  counts and ground survey observations.  A key feature of the  Battese-Fuller model is the county effect parameter and this effect  was found to be highly significant for corn, the most prevalent of the  four crops considered in the study.  Furthermore, this effect  manifested itself within several strata but was negligible across  strata.  The study nonetheless indicated robustness of the Battese-  Fuller estimators against departure from certain model assumptions.  Two members of the Battese-Fuller family satisfied the criterion for  small relative root mean square error; i.e. less                         Table 4: County Estimates for Mississippi 1991          County     Official       Computed        % Diff*          CV             Cotton    acres (000)    acres (000)      percent        percent          Bolivar       65.5               61.6            6.0            9.9    Coahoma      105.7               88.3           16.5            4.8    Humphreys     61.6               57.3            7.0            5.9    Issaquena     38.0               34.6            9.0           11.3    Leflore       79.2               87.8           10.9            4.0    Quitman       31.O               46.4           49.7            8.6    Sharkey       47.0               48.6            3.4            7.0    Sunflower    100.0               79.3           20.7            6.9    Tallahatchie  64.2               67.9            5.8            7.2    Tunica        45.6               38.0           16.7            6.6    Washington    95.7              102.4            7.0            3.9    Yazoo         94.5               93.9             .6            8.0    Total        828.0              806.1      Rice       Bolivar       74.0               66.2           10.5            5.4    Coahoma       15.8               1O.4           34.2           24.0    Humphreys      3.6                7.1           97.2           32.4    Leflore       16.6               19.4           16.9           18.6    Sharkey        5.0                7.8           56.0           21.8    Sunflower     36.0               37.8            5.0            9.3    Tallahatchie   9.6                8.5           11.5           35.3    Tunica        17.5                9.9           43.4           26.3    Washington    30.5               22.6           25.9           15.5    Total        208.6              189.7             *   Click  HERE  for graphic.           than 20 percent of the estimate was attributable to root mean square  error.  These members were the estimators that minimized mean square  error and bias, respectively, under the model assumptions.  However,  the Battese-Fuller estimate closest to the Huddleston-Ray estimate was  far less satisfactory, failing to meet the desired upper limits for  mean square error and bias.           This study provided the justification for replacing the Huddleston-Ray  estimator with the Battese- Fuller family.     The reliability of the county estimates based on the Battese-Fuller  model has been closely watched since its implementation in 1982.  As  mentioned previously, these estimates are only one of possibly four or  more indications that are composited to provide the final published  crop acreage values.  The reliability of the Battese-Fuller estimates  can vary between years, between crops, between counties and between  States depending on the stage of the crop at the time of the Landsat  imagery, the amount of crop acreage within the county, the number of  segments within the county and cloud cover.  The results presented in  Tables 2 and 3 for corn are relatively good with all CVs less than 5  percent and over half of the percentage differences from the published  value less than 4 percent.  The soybean results are slightly poorer,  with CVs ranging from 4 percent to 11 percent and percentage  differences ranging up to 18 percent.  Table 4 presents more recent  results for a set of counties covered by Landsat in Mississippi for  1991.  A review of the CVs and percentage differences indicate that  the Battese-Fuller estimates can have relatively large CVs and  percentage differences when the county crop acreage is less than  30,000 acres.  Some summary statistics of the differences for the four  crop examples discussed are presented in Table 5.  The mean average  difference is typically less than 10,000 acres, but       Table 5: Summary Statistics on Accuracy of Battese-Fuller Estimates  (1000 acres)       Crop/State/Year         MD*      RMSD*     MAD*      LAD*     Corn Iowa 1988           -0.6      6.8       5.4       14.3     Soybeans Iowa 1988       -8.6      11.9      9.1       25.5     Cotton Mississippi 1991  -1.8      10.0      7.8       20.7     Rice Mississippi 1991    -2.1       5.2      4.5        7.9     *  MD    =  mean difference between Battese-Fuller and published value        RMSD  =  root mean squared deviation        MAD   =  mean absolute difference        LAD   =  largest absolute difference                 for small county acreages such as rice in Mississippi, large  percentage differences may still occur.  Consequently, NASS SSO's  still use additional survey and administrative data to help set the  published values.        6.6 Current Problems and Activities     As technology improves, new sensors produce satellite data that can be  more accurately classified to a given crop than ever before.  Consequently, the overall count of pixels classified to a given crop  within a county can possibly be used directly to estimate crop  acreage.  The overall pixel count represents a census of pixels  covering the county and therefore is not subject to sampling error.  However, a nonsampling error is introduced due to inaccuracies in the  classification.  A general expression for such an estimator is:           Click  HERE  for graphic.        Click  HERE  for graphic.        Both adjustment terms are conceptually simple.  The combined ratio  uses stratum level survey information to compute the adjustment term  that may provide a more accurate conversion of pixel counts to crop  area than the set conversion factor.  Also, the ratio has a readily  available formula for estimating the variance.     Research continues to focus on identifying new geographic areas and  crops where this estimator would be applicable.  Also, possible  benefits of remotely sensed data from alternative sources, such as  radar satellites, will be investigated as the newer sources are  available.  In recent years TM sensor data have been used to produce  county estimates in the Delta region.  County estimates of rice,  cotton, and soybeans were produced for Arkansas and Mississippi, in  1991, with Louisiana added in 1992.  In 1993 satellite data are only  being used in Arkansas due to budgetary constraints.  To date, the  satellite based estimates have only been produced on a limited scale.  The NASS SSO's continue to rely on other data series for helping set  the published county estimates of crop acreages.  They conduct a large  non-probability county estimates survey (see Chapter 7) that serves a  dual purpose of also providing updated control data for the list  sampling frame.  This is an integral part of the NASS survey program  and so will continue in some form for the foreseeable future.  Fairly  reliable administrative data sources are also available.  NASS is  continuing to investigate the benefits of satellite based county  estimates in relation to these other available data sources.  One  by-product of the satellite data process that is attractive to the  State offices is color coded land use maps at the county level.  These  maps provide a pictorial view of the distribution of the crops within  each county.  Identifying alternative uses of satellite data such as  this is an important research objective of NASS.                 REFERENCES        Allen, J.D.

This study was conducted by R. W. Beck, Inc. as part of the National Recycling Coalition's U. S. Recycling Economic Information (US REI) Study, and data from the Ohio REI study was incorporated into the US REI Study results. The Ohio REI study conforms to the methodology developed by the Northeast Recycling Council for gathering economic data on the recycling and reuse industries.1 This Executive Summary contains the results of the study. The remainder of the report is dedicated to a complete and thorough documentation of the results and the methodology used in producing them. This study had two primary goals: 1. Document the size of the recycling and reuse industries in Ohio; and 2. Contribute REI data to the US REI Study. To achieve the two goals, the project approach included the following steps: A review of existing sources of recycling and reuse data; Creation of a database of recycling and reuse businesses and surveying them to gather primary data for categories where little or no existing information was otherwise found; Deriving estimates using limited existing information for categories with insufficient existing data or incomplete/unavailable lists of establishments; Conducting limited surveys to gather supplemental intermediate input data for economic modeling; and Conducting economic modeling to estimate the total economic values.  SUM  MARY OF  DIRECT R  ESULTS  Twenty-six recycling and reuse industry categories are used in this study and can be grouped into the following two sectors based on the general types of activities undertaken: Recycling; and Reuse and Remanufacturing.  1  Northeast Recycling Council, Recycling Economic Information Study, June 2000.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  ES-1   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study Direct industry size data was determined for each category by one of three methods: Utilizing existing data from a variety of sources including the U.S. Census Bureau, publications of trade associations, and periodicals; Surveying establishments and performing a statistical analysis of results; or Deriving estimates using limited existing information. Table ES-1 presents the estimates of direct economic activity, by category and sector, for Ohio. As shown in the table, Ohio hosts approximately 3,200 recycling and reuse establishments employing nearly 100,000 people generating an annual payroll of $3.6 billion and $22.5 billion in annual revenues. A majority of the economic activity for the recycling and reuse industries is accounted for by the following four categories: Recyclable material wholesalers; Plastics converters; Steel mills; and Iron and steel foundries. These four categories alone account for 61 percent of all employees, 70 percent of wages, and 74 percent of total receipts. A noticeable distinction exists between the recycling and reuse sectors regarding the size of establishments and average annual payroll. The recycling establishments have an average of 46 employees each, with an average annual payroll per employee of $39,000. Comparatively, the reuse sector is made up of smaller establishments (an average of 7 employees per establishment) with an average annual payroll of $17,000 per employee. Although the reuse and remanufacturing sector comprises 38 percent of total establishments, it makes up only 9 percent of total employees, 4 percent of payroll, and 4 percent of receipts. These figures are thought to represent the minimum amount of reuse and remanufacturing captured by the methodology, however, because remanufacturing activities are often included with traditional manufacturing industries that were not included in this study. Several years ago Professor Robert T. Lund of Boston University estimated remanufacturing activities on a national level,2 although state or regional estimates were not attempted. Extrapolating figures from his study down to Ohio indicated that reuse and remanufacturing categories might be as much as three times that characterized by this study's methodology.  2  Professor Robert T.

W. Beck, Inc.  ES-5   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study Another important observation can be made by comparing recycling categories that are primarily local establishments performing collection, sorting, and densification activities to those that source material from large distances for downstream processing, conversion, or manufacturing operations. Local collection and processing (baling, grading, densifying, etc.) includes: Government staffed residential curbside collection; Privately-staffed residential curbside collection; Compost and miscellaneous organics products producers; Materials recovery facilities; and Recyclable material wholesalers. Establishments in the remaining recycling categories are considered to be downstream processors of recycled materials and tend to utilize recycled materials in manufacturing. When the two groups are compared, ""local"" collection and processing make up about 13 percent of total recycling employment and 12 percent of receipts whereas non-local downstream processing makes up the remaining 87 percent of employment and 88 percent of receipts. This suggests that public and private investment in local recyclables collection and processing infrastructure pays great dividends in downstream private recycling economic activity. Public policy in the form of state or local laws and regulations that require collection of recyclables or that discourage disposal (e.g., disposal taxes, material specific bans, etc.) directly affects these local public and private sector establishments, and indirectly affects the larger recycling and reuse industry as a whole.  SUM  MARY OF INDIRECT AND INDUCED ECONOMIC  ACTIVITY  In addition to the twenty-six categories of direct recycling and reuse establishments, the study estimated data for four specific categories of support businesses that provide goods or services to recycling and reuse industry establishments as shown in Table ES-2. The general category Other Indirect Establishments shown in the table includes all other indirect establishments that provide goods or services (such as office supply companies, accounting firms, legal firms, building and landscape maintenance firms, etc.).

Here are some statistics: The average wage paid by Ohio's recycling and reuse industry is $36,600  approximately $8,000 per year more than the State's average wage. The recycling and reuse industry supports 4.3 percent of the jobs in Ohio  1.7 percent through direct employment, and 2.6 percent by industry and employee spending in the economy.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  ES-7   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study Some 3.7 percent of Ohio's gross state product is attributable to the recycling and reuse industry, with 1.8 percent provided directly by the industry.

However, further study is necessary to rigorously assess the impact of public policy on recycling economic activity and to document recycling and reuse industry growth over the baseline established in this report.3  3  The results of the National REI Study includes information on the size of the recycling and reuse industry in many states, and can be reviewed to gain  insight on the influence that various states' public policies may have had in their states.

Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study  1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 O VERVIEW  This report presents the results of the Ohio Recycling Economic Information (REI) Study commissioned by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (DNR). This study was conducted by R. W. Beck, Inc. as part of the National Recycling Coalition's U. S. Recycling Economic Information (US REI) Study. Data from this study has been incorporated into the US REI Study, along with data from other states cooperating in that study. The goal of the study was to document the size of the recycling and reuse industry by first determining direct economic information for each of twenty-six categories of recycling and reuse establishments. The direct economic values that were measured included: Number of establishments; Employment; Annual payroll; Annual receipts; and Annual throughput (for applicable categories). Next, similar information was estimated for four categories of supporting establishments intimately involved in the recycling and reuse industry. Finally, the broader effect of recycling and reuse businesses and their employees on the economy was derived through economic modeling using direct data as inputs. This information included: Indirect economic values (inter-industry linkages as measured by purchase of intermediate commodities); Induced economic values (personal spending by employees of direct and indirect establishments); Multipliers to calculate total economic values (the sum of direct, indirect, and induced) from direct economic values; and Tax revenues attributable to the recycling and reuse industry.  1.2 COMPA  RISON TO SIMILAR STUDIES  The Ohio REI study conforms to the methodology for gathering economic data on the recycling and reuse industries developed by the Northeast Recycling Council (NERC) on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As a result, the information contained in this report is directly comparable to that of REI studies conducted for:  R. W. Beck, Inc.  1 -1   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study The Northeast Recycling Council,4 including the states of Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont; The National Recycling Coalition,5 for the nation as a whole and the states of California, Florida, Indiana, Illinois, and Nebraska; and Other states that conform to the specified REI methodology.6 At least seven other recycling economic information studies had been performed before NERC developed a standard REI study methodology. Although those existing studies quantified employment and most included other industry size estimates (such as annual sales or value-added), they used varying (and sometimes inconsistent) data collection methodologies and industry definitions. Therefore, care should be taken if attempting to compare the results of this study to previous studies. Table 1-1 lists the types of data collected in this study compared to three previous economic information studies.

Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study  2 DATA CHARACTERIZATION 2.1 STUDY BOUNDARIES Defining the recycling and reuse industry is complex. For example, one establishment may perform a variety of processing and/or manufacturing activities, only some of which are related to recycling or reuse. So the question arises whether the establishment should be included, and if so, what portion of that establishment's activities should be attributed to recycling/reuse. In the case of product manufacturing, both recycled and non-recycled materials may be used, again raising the question whether the total activity should be included or only a partial amount. The most challenging issue that recycling economic information studies face is defining the extent of economic information to include when an industry is able to utilize recovered as well as virgin feedstock or makes an intermediate product as well as converts those intermediate products to end-products within the same facility. Consistent with the methodology developed by NERC on behalf of the EPA, this study includes those activities that are most essential to the continued recycling of materials and reuse of used products. The study boundaries:   Include all ""supply side"" activities involved in recovering and preparing materials and used products for resale; Include ""demand side"" activities up to the first point at which the recovered materials or used products have successfully competed directly against their respective primary, or virgin, equivalents; Exclude the activities of non-business entities such as individuals, and of advocacy, education and other organizations which do not directly add value to recovered materials and used products, or directly support such activities; and Exclude activities involving incineration or use of materials as fuel.      ""Recycling and Reuse"" as defined in this study includes the following ""covered activities"":   Collecting materials or used products for the purposes of intermediate processing, manufacturing, and/or distribution by reuse sales establishments; Intermediate processing of recovered materials or used products including sorting, cleaning, consolidating, treating, disassembling, densifying, and/or transferring ownership for use in processing, product manufacturing, and/or for distribution by reuse sales establishments; Reclaiming of recovered materials or used products to produce refined raw materials and/or reusable products meeting the specifications of manufacturers, reuse sales establishments or other end-users;    R. W. Beck, Inc.  2 -1   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study    Manufacturing ""first-stage"" products containing recycled materials or used products; Operating wholesale or retail sales establishments that offer, largely or exclusively, used products prepared for reuse; and Intimately supporting the above activities through research, equipment development and sales, consulting, engineering, brokering, and exchange services.  The end-point of recycling is considered to be the ""first-stage"" manufactured product. ""First-stage"" refers to the first product produced from recycled materials, such as a roll of paper, sheet of plastic, glass bottle or metal billet. First-stage products are often converted into finished products (e.g., envelopes, plastic bottles, or metal parts), sometimes at the same facility. Only production of first-stage products is intended to be included in this definition. At this stage, the recycled material has successfully competed against virgin material and is often indistinguishable from other first-stage products that are made from those virgin materials. This study attempted to exclude economic activity associated with further conversion within the same facility as these are essentially manufacturing rather than recycling activities.  2.2 BUSI  NESS  CAT  EGORIES  This report presents recycling and reuse industry data for twenty-six separate business categories. Data is also presented for four categories of support businesses because of their intimate involvement in the industry. The business categories are grouped into three major sectors:    Recycling Industry: includes all collection and processing of recovered materials and manufacturing using recycled materials; Reuse and Remanufacturing Industry: includes preparation of materials for reuse and remanufacturing of used or broken equipment; and Support Businesses: businesses that do not directly recycle materials or reuse products, but provide specialized equipment and services necessary to the recycling and reuse industry.

Direct Economic Information: Information directly derived from the establishments in each business category and necessary to document industry size; and 2. Total Economic Information: Information on the economic values that recycling and reuse establishments induce in the greater economy at the state level, including state tax revenue impacts.  2 -4  R. W. Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study In deriving the direct information, five primary data types were developed: 1. Number of Establishments: An establishment is a single physical location where business is conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed; 2. Employment: Consists of full and part-time employees, including salaried officers and executives of corporations; 3. Total Annual Payroll: Includes all forms of compensation, such as salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation allowances, sick-leave pay, and the value of payments in kind (e.g., free meals and lodgings) paid during the year to all employees; 4. Total Annual Receipts: Revenue for goods produced, distributed, or services provided, including revenue earned from premiums, commissions and fees, rents, interest, dividends, and royalties. Excludes all revenue collected for local, state, and federal taxes; and 5. Total Throughput: Total tons of recovered materials collected or processed. This data type was not gathered for reuse and support business categories because reuse businesses typically do not track throughput data in a manner comparable to recycling businesses (e.g., they may use the number of units remanufactured rather than tons). The total economic information, developed through economic modeling, generated four secondary data types: 1. Indirect Economic Values: Economic activity accrued by other establishments (suppliers and customers) as a result of the activities of the recycling and reuse businesses; 2. Induced Economic Values: Economic activity accrued by retail and other establishments because of personal purchases by recycling and reuse industry and indirect establishment employees; 3. Multipliers: The ratio of total values (direct, indirect, and induced) to direct values; and 4. Tax Revenues: State revenues derived from taxes, charges and fees, and miscellaneous revenues.  R. W.

This section includes general descriptions of strategies for data gathering and analysis employed in the study. Notes on the specific methodology for the direct data for each category are shown in Section 4 along with the results of the study.  3.2 APPROAC  HES TO  DIR  ECT  DATA DEVELOP  MENT  In developing the direct economic information reported in Section 4, one of three methods was employed for each business category, depending on the availability and adequacy of existing information and business lists:  Existing Data: Obtained through existing sources of information (e.g., U.S. Census Bureau's Economic Census, U.S. Geological Survey's Mineral Commodity Reports, expert opinions by industry and trade associations); Survey Data: Gathered by surveying the businesses directly and compiling the data into a database of establishments; or Derivation: Limited existing data was used to derive estimates of economic activity.     The study focused on using existing data, of sufficient quality, and with categories defined consistently with the study, for as many business categories as possible to avoid duplicating efforts if sources of existing information were available. If little or no existing information was available but listings of businesses in a category were available, the next option was to develop a database of businesses and conduct surveys to obtain the desired economic information. When limited existing information was available, but no specific list of establishments could be found for purposes of surveying, estimates were derived based on limited existing data and estimations by industry experts. Due to the number of different business categories included in this study, the exact methodology used to calculate economic activity for each category was tailored to fit the material flows and processes found in each. Table 3-1 lists the business categories and the approach used for each category.  R. W.

Furthermore, Appendix B summarizes data sources used for compiling the survey database or otherwise used for producing direct data for this study. After the direct economic values were developed, total economic through economic modeling, using the direct data as inputs. economic model accurately, certain categories required additional intermediate inputs. To derive the total economic values, the taken:  values were estimated In order to apply the information, known as following steps were  Survey for Intermediate Inputs  A detailed survey of a limited number of establishments was conducted to obtain estimates of the amounts of expenditures on inputs such as raw materials, chemicals, electricity, accounting services and other items necessary for production (usually expressed as a dollar amount per $1,000 in output for a particular type of industry); and Conduct Economic Modeling  A process based on an input-output approach developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Several models have been developed, including RIMS II, IMPLAN, and REMI. The model chosen for this study was the IMPLAN.    3.2.1  EXI  STING  DATA  The first strategy employed was to utilize existing data from public sources or trade associations. The most common example of this strategy was the use of U.S. Census Bureau reports when a category defined in the study was aligned with a distinct SIC code. Reports from the U.S. Census included an extract created from the Standard Statistical Establishments List (SSEL) and the 1997 Economic Census. Other sources of publicly available data included U. S. Geological Survey reports and reports developed by individual state governments.  3.2.1.1  Relation of SIC and NAICS to Business Categories  The U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census compiles and reports a wide range of economic data on U.S. industrial activity. Prior to 1997, the Census Bureau classified businesses according to the SIC system developed by the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget. The system classified establishments by their primary activity. Beginning in 1997, the SIC system is being phased out and will be replaced by the new North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). The new system harmonizes systems used in Mexico and Canada, in accordance with the North American Free Trade Agreement. Table A-1, in Appendix A, attempts to classify each business category in the study by SIC and NAICS. The codes were assigned by comparing each business category to the definitions listed in the SIC and NAICS manuals. In many cases, the listed SIC also includes businesses not involved in recycling and reuse.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  3 -3   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study 3.2.1.2 Use of U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census Statistics  The primary source of U.S. Census data used for this study was an extract of the Standard Statistical Establishments List (SSEL) for relevant SIC codes. Because the most recent year available was 1996, the data for this study is referenced by SIC code. The SSEL provides number of establishments, number of employees, payroll, and receipts for each SIC code. It should be noted that certain data are not disclosed when an SIC code has a small number of associated businesses and showing exact numbers would reveal sensitive information for a particular company. In order to use the data when disclosure problems were encountered, a method of estimating based on suppression codes was developed. The U.S. Census Bureau uses lettered suppression codes to represent the range of employees for the category. When required, an estimate of number of employees was calculated by taking the midpoint of each suppression code range and adding all the midpoints for all suppression codes for a particular SIC code. For example, an SIC code with three establishments may have one establishment with code ""a"" (0-4 employees), one establishment with code ""c"" (10-19 employees) and the third establishment with code ""d"" (20-99 employees). In this case, the estimate used for this study was 2 for the first establishment, 14.5 for the second, and 59.5 for the third; for an estimated total of 76 employees. When fractions occurred in the total, the total was rounded down. In cases of disclosure, the U.S. Census Bureau does not give any information for payroll and estimated receipts. In such cases, payroll and receipts were estimated by using an average payroll per employee and average receipts per employee, based on U.S. totals for employees, payroll, and receipts. See Appendix C for a sample of data provided by U.S. Census SSEL.  3.2.1.3  Additional Sources of Existing Data  Although the most commonly used existing data was the U.S. Census SSEL, other sources provided throughput data or partial data for use in derivations. The most common source of throughput data was the 1997 Economic Census, a series of reports on industrial activity prepared by the U.S. Census Bureau. Other major sources of existing information and their contributions include:     American Forest & Paper Association  State-wide throughput data for paper, paperboard, and deinked market pulp mills; American Plastics Council  Database provided employment and throughput data for plastics reclaimers; Ohio Department of Natural Resources  Lists of recycling and reuse establishments in Ohio, including contact information for those establishments.

Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study  U.S. Geological Survey  Expert opinions on the recycling of nonferrous metals and the percentage of activities to include in the study for nonferrous product producers and nonferrous foundries.  3.2.2  S  URVEY  DATA  When little or no existing data was available for a particular business category, R.W. Beck conducted surveys of those businesses and performed a statistical analysis of the results to develop estimates of economic activity.  3.2.2.1  Recycling Economic Information Study Database  The National Recycling Coalition as part of the US REI study developed a national database of establishments as a tool for surveying businesses in categories with little or no sources of existing data. The database was compiled from various electronic databases, state directories, periodicals, and other sources. During the survey process, about 350 establishments were confirmed to be in survey categories in the state of Ohio. Of the remaining Ohio establishments, as many as 184 are thought to be in survey categories. Although the database contains a number of businesses that are not in survey categories, those listings are incidental incorporations from electronic directories. Please refer to Table 3-1 for a listing of the survey categories for which the database was developed.  3.2.2.2  Survey Design  The survey was designed to obtain economic information from businesses in categories with little or no existing information. Appendix D contains a copy of the survey forms that were used for this study. The survey cover page confirmed the database records for company name, mailing information, physical location, and contact person. For companies with more than one physical location, one cover page and survey for each physical location were completed. The survey solicited responses to the following questions: 1. Classify the establishment according to the categories defined for the study (respondents could check more than one category); 2. Identify the single category that is most representative of the recycling or reuserelated operations for the establishment; 3. Give estimations of establishment size including number of employees, total annual payroll, and total annual receipts; 4. Estimate the percentages of labor and receipts based on covered recycling activities; and 5. Estimate the amounts, by type, of recycled materials processed. Checkboxes with associated ranges (e.g., 0-9 employees, $50,000-$149,999 total payroll) were used for questions regarding number of employees, payroll, receipts, and  R. W. Beck, Inc.  3 -5   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study percentages. Due to the sensitive nature of the survey questions, it was anticipated that asking for responses in ranges rather than exact numbers would increase the response rate. With enough responses, any variation from exact amounts was likely averaged out.  3.2.2.3  Survey Approach  Prior to beginning the project it was estimated and budgeted that approximately 1,000 establishments would be identified as potentially being in survey categories. Once the survey database was finalized, 1,040 establishments were listed as being in survey categories or as ""unknown."" All of these establishments were mailed a survey. Then, at least three follow-up telephone attempts were made to establishments that failed to respond to the mailed survey in order to obtain survey information. Furthermore, Ohio DNR staff also contacted unresponsive establishments in an effort to encourage them to complete the survey. Once surveys were completed, senior staff reviewed all survey data for accuracy and completeness. Responses were then entered into the REI Study database. After checking the database for errors, the raw data was compiled and analyzed using a statistical approach.  3.2.2.4  Survey Calculations  Survey data was analyzed in an attempt to identify the recycling characteristics of establishments in Ohio. Survey data on three variables (number of employees, payroll, and receipts) provided the primary information analyzed. Survey information obtained from 350 firms was used to estimate the number of employees7 involved in recycling activities, as well as the dollar value of recycling and reuse payroll and receipts. Based on initial estimates and survey participation responses, R. W. Beck estimated the total number of firms engaged in recycling activities for each of thirteen survey business categories in the state. In Ohio, 581 establishments are believed to be involved in recycling activities in these categories. For a detailed explanation of the statistical analysis of surveys, please refer to Appendix E.  3.2.3  DERIVAT  ION  D  ATA  In the third strategy, derivations were made by using data from a variety of sources, such as trade organizations, industry experts, periodicals and other publications. Data points from various sources were pieced together to develop estimates of economic activity. As an example of this approach, a detailed explanation of the sources and methodology used for both public and private curbside collection of recyclables is given in Section 4.3, note 6. Additionally, direct data for three of the four support business categories was derived as a result of economic modeling.  7  Employee responses were adjusted to a full-time equivalent basis. Thus, two employees each working 50% on recycling activities would be counted as one recycling employee.  3 -6  R. W. Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study 3.3 I NTERMEDIATE INPUT  DATA  FOR ECONOMIC  MODEL  ING  Prior to beginning economic modeling, the 26 direct recycling and reuse business categories were evaluated to identify those categories where recycling establishments were thought to significantly differ from similar non-recycling establishments in the way they operate, their process inputs, and their purchases from other establishments in the economy. Next, existing in-house data from previous studies was examined to identify where recycling and reuse industry-specific data was lacking. For those categories lacking adequate input data, a detailed survey that asked for much greater detail regarding the cost elements of production was sent to select establishments. Those establishments that were cooperative and expressed interest in the study during the gathering of the direct economic information (employment, payroll, and revenues) were targeted for the additional surveys. Only a handful of establishments were targeted for each business category because the major process inputs and cost elements of the businesses were assumed to be very similar to each other (and quite different from the cost elements of virgin business establishments).  3.4 E  CONOMIC  MOD  ELING  This study modeled indirect, induced, and total economic values of 26 categories of recycling or reuse establishments using the IMPLAN8 economic model. Economic modeling started with the purchase of data files that provided a standard inter-industrial accounting of the economy of Ohio. These data files were procured from Minnesota IMPLAN Group, Inc., the data supplier for the IMPLAN model. What followed was an eight-step process to construct a model that would isolate the 26 categories of recycling and reuse establishments from other establishments in the state so that their economic values could be separately analyzed and reported. The eight-step process is described below: 1. U.S. standard industrial classifications were identified that best corresponded to the kind of recycling product, process, or service that each of the 26 recycling and reuse categories produces. This was necessary because there is no specific set of ""recycling and reuse"" industries in the 537 industries contained in the data files. 2. These industrial types were controlled for in the initial model while the remaining industries were aggregated to the one-digit SIC level. The initial model that was produced, then, had twenty-six specific recycling industry candidates and twelve broad industrial aggregates (e.g., farming, the remainders of manufacturing, wholesale trade, transportation, etc.). 3. The direct values obtained from the study were substituted for the direct values (also called the ""social"" accounts) in the model. Estimates of returns to proprietors, 8 The modeling system used for this study is called IMPLAN Pro, published by the Minnesota IMPLAN Group, Inc. Data are available and may be purchased from  this company for all states and all counties in the U.S. Their data standards are rigorous, their data sets are updated annually, and their methods for compiling and processing the main input-output data sets are widely considered to be a significant enhancement of the basic input-output data that are compiled and solicited by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This company has the largest user base of any of the commercial input-output models available in the U.S.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  3 -7   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study property income, and indirect tax payments to state and local governments were derived from the averages of the original industrial group. This assumed that the recycling or reuse firms yield roughly the same return on investment to sole proprietors or investors as the corresponding industry that may contain significant non-recycling establishments. 4. The remaining values in the parent category (the original values minus the recycling industry direct values) were then manually placed back into the one-digit industrial sector so that the only direct data in the sector reflected the recycling and reuse industries. This ensured the model's total amount of industrial activity summed to precisely the same value as it had originally, before isolating recycling and reuse business categories. 5. Recycling and reuse establishments differ from non-recycling and reuse establishments in the way they operate, their process inputs, and their purchases from other establishments in the economy. This step attempted to account for these differences with data from two sources: (1) the additional intermediate input data that was collected as described previously; and (2) ""in-house"" data from other previous county-level studies that were conducted in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Wisconsin counties that reflected the kinds of recycling industries measured in this study but did not contain virgin-only establishments. Twelve models were built from in-house data from counties to isolate recycling industries (primarily ferrous and nonferrous metals, plastics manufacturing, and paper industries) and their production characteristics. The production inputs in the model were then reconfigured so that the industrial linkages to raw commodities, mining, or refiners were reduced and linkages to recycling-related processors were strengthened. These changes resulted in a recalculation of all of the production input values for each recycling and reuse industry category. 6. There are several other components to input-output modeling that were investigated. One modification involved changing regional purchase coefficients (RPCs) in the model. For some materials, recycled commodities may be shipped on average less or greater distances than the virgin alternative, including across state boundaries. In-house data from a previous Recycle Iowa Study (an early economic impact study of recycling) of the general likelihood of a recycled commodity being purchased locally for industrial usage was examined for its bearing on this study. Absent other information about some commodity types, the RPC adjustment for a recycling commodity that was believed to be much more likely purchased locally was estimated by taking the square root of the existing number for that industry. For example, an RPC of 0.31 in a commodity supply category would be inflated to 0.56 to increase the likelihood that the input commodity was purchased locally. RPCs were only changed for a small subset of industries9 and were only done so to maximize the expected linkage between recovered materials collection, processing, and conversion into final demand goods.  9  RPCs were increased for the following categories: compost and miscellaneous organics producers, plastics reclaimers, motor vehicle parts (used),and wood reuse.  3 -8  R. W. Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study There were other account categories that were assessed also in the input-output model. The byproducts category in the model itemizes the commodity production by industry. Each of these categories was scrutinized and assessed as to its reasonableness for each recycling or reuse industry. No other accounts categories were altered in the models (including exports, institutional demands, or household incomes). 7. The resulting model was then re-checked for errors, omissions, and reasonableness and re-estimated in final form. This step included rebalancing the model so that the gross total equaled the original starting values. 8. Once the final state model was constructed, multipliers were generated for each recycling and reuse industry for Total Industrial Output, Personal Income, Value Added, and Jobs. These multipliers were applied to the original direct values to isolate each industry's unique economic contribution. In order to estimate state revenues associated with the economic data (direct as well as indirect and induced), data on Ohio's government finances were gathered for 1995 through 1997 from the U.S. Census of Governments publications. Data on incomes were obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis Regional Economic Information System. Annual incomes were converted to fiscal values, and the weighted average revenue incidences for state government own-source revenues10 was compiled for:     All State Taxes (e.g., personal, corporate, sales, use, excise, etc.) Charges and Fees (e.g., direct state charges and fees, including higher education and health) Miscellaneous Revenues (e.g., special revenues, gifts, interest earnings, etc.) Total Own-Source Revenues (i.e., the sum of the previous three items).  The revenue indices that were developed were then applied to the direct and total values of industrial output and personal income to yield state revenue estimates.  3.5 VALIDAT  ION OF STUDY  R  ESULTS  Upon completion of the REI study, various methods of internal and external review were used to ensure that both direct and indirect study results are valid and meaningful. The methods of internal review included:    Review of completed surveys by senior staff; Comparisons to other industries in the region; and Estimations of recycling and reuse as a portion of Ohio's economy.  External review included a review of the direct economic information for the 26 recycling and reuse categories by the DNR. Furthermore, a previous review by state 10  ""Own-source"" means collected through the state revenue system and not received, for example, as a state disbursement of funds collected through the federal  revenue system.

The section contains:     A general description of the format for the data tables; A detailed table of results, including numbered notes that correspond to specific data points in the data table and explain how the data was derived; An analysis of the results; and A discussion of the accuracy and completeness of the results. ENERAL  4.1 G  N  OTES ON  DATA TABLES  This section provides general information regarding the format of the data tables presented in section 4.2. Detailed descriptions of all table column headings and an explanation of the three tiers of data presented are given here.  4.1.1  T  HREE-TIERED  A  PPROACH TO  D  ATA PRESENTATION  Three facts about recycling and reuse businesses complicate recycling economic information studies and have led to inconsistency in past efforts: 1. Most establishments involved in recycling and reuse are part of industries in which many establishments do not recycle or reuse recovered materials or products at all; 2. Some establishments involved in recycling or reuse are also involved in nonrecycling activities not intended to be covered in this study; and 3. Many recycling manufacturers use less than 100 percent recycled feedstock and/or adjust the percentage of recycled feedstock throughout the year. Past studies have handled each of these challenges differently. In an effort to exclude non-recycling activities, some studies relied on survey respondents to estimate recycling activities. Other studies have targeted all facilities involved in recycling and did not attempt to adjust the statistics to account for non-recycling activities. Various industry and recycling experts have criticized both approaches. To overcome these challenges, the Ohio REI Study is reporting three tiers of statistics. The goals of this approach are:  To report statistics on recycling and reuse-related businesses as they actually exist in the economy (i.e., as part of industries and establishments that do not always involve recycling); and To derive conservative estimates for the amount of economic activity that can ""reasonably"" be attributed exclusively to recycling. The three tiers of statistics are described below. 4 -1    R. W. Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study 4.1.1.1 Tier One - Statistics on All Industry Establishments  Tier One statistics are reported only for certain business categories where data was available from a source that included all establishments in the category, even though some of them may not do any recycling. This information typically comes from U.S. Bureau of Census data by SIC code. For example, data for all paper mills will be shown even though some of those establishments do not utilize recovered paper.  4.1.1.2  Tier Two - Statistics on Establishments Involved in Recycling  Like Tier One, Tier Two statistics are only reported for certain business categories where data was available from a source that aggregated data for recycling and non-recycling establishments. The data covers only those establishments that have some involvement in recycling, and attempts to exclude data on establishments with no recycling activities. Although all of these establishments perform some amount of recycling or reuse activity, they may also perform non-recycling activities not covered in this report. For example, information on all paper mills that utilize recovered paper would be included here, even though some of these establishments may also be involved in non-covered activities like production of wood pulp.  4.1.1.3  Tier Three - Statistics on Covered Recycling Activities  Tier Three statistics are the heart of this study and are reported for all business categories. They are conservative estimates of the portion of economic activity in Tier One or Tier Two that can be reasonably attributed to the recycling activities covered in the study. Most Tier Three estimates are derived from survey results in which respondents themselves are asked to identify what percentage of their facility's activities involves ""covered activities.""12 For some important categories, including paper, plastics and metals manufacturers, an algorithm is being used to estimate covered economic activity. The algorithms begin with Tier One and Tier Two data as described above. Then, the percentage of Tier Two activity involving covered recycling activities is being estimated based on available statistics and industry expert opinions. The exact approach used for each category is documented in detail in Section 4.3. Additionally, Tier Three statistics are reported in two columns, depending on whether the establishments in the category are ""100 percent dependent on recycling,"" or simply ""undertaking recycling activities."" Those establishments that are dependent on recycling have 100 percent of employment and revenues derived from recycling activities, while those that are ""undertaking recycling activities"" have only a portion of economic activity derived from recycling. This distinction is intended to assist in accurately and conservatively reporting overall results and to further illuminate the actual structure of the recycling industry.  4.1.2  DEFINITIONS  OF  C  OLUMN  H  EADINGS IN THE  D  ATA  T  ABLES  For Table 4-2, the lettered column headings are defined as follows:  12  For a complete definition of covered activities, refer to Section 2.1 and note 2 on page 4-9.  4 -2  R.

This column excludes any virgin- only establishments that may be shown in Column C. E. Statistics on Establishments Undertaking Recycling or Reuse Activities  a subset of Column D and focuses on the employment, payroll, and receipts figures in establishments with less than 100 percent of operations involved in recycling or reuse-related activities. The same establishments are considered in columns D and E. The employment, payroll, and receipts figures are adjusted to eliminate employees who are focused on virgin material preparation, and further discounted for other non-covered activities. F. Statistics on Establishments 100% Recycling or Reuse-Dependent  estimates for establishments with 100 percent of operations dependent on recycling or reuse, which in most cases establishments consume no virgin material.16 This column presents data that is discounted for non-covered activities. 13  Note that subtotals and grand totals for throughput are not shown due to the potential for triple-counting material by adding tons of the same material at three  different stages    collection, local processing, and reclamation/manufacturing.  14  A category may not show data for Column C because: (1) it does not have virgin-only establishments; or (2) virgin-only establishments were excluded from the  data collection process.  15 16  For a complete definition of covered recycling activities, refer to page 2-1 and note 2 on page 4-9. All domestic steel mills depend on a minimum level of scrap in their processes. Therefore, all steel mill economic activity is included in this column even though  some mills use virgin feedstock.

[1] Statistics for Column C include data for all establishments in industries with recycling or reuse-related activities. Although the industry overall performs recycling or reuse-related activities, it may include some establishments with no recycling or reuse-related activities. [2] Covered activities is defined as all activities that support: Transforming pre-consumer materials or post-consumer products into a recycled material; Transforming recycled materials into a first intermediate product (e.g., sheet, fiber, roll); Transforming recycled materials directly into a finished product; Preparing used products for reuse; and Manufacturing equipment for the recycling or reuse industries. Covered activities do not include converting a first intermediate product to finished or semi-finished products or preparing materials for fuel use. [3] Statistics are for establishments with some amount of covered recycling activities. Establishments may perform both non-recycling and recycling activities. [4] These estimates include activities where virgin and recycled feedstock materials are co-processed. The estimates do not include virgin-only feedstock material preparation activities and further conversion of intermediate products to finished or semi-finished goods. [5] Statistics on establishments where 100 percent of labor and receipts are dependent on recycling or reuse-related activities. The estimates do not include virgin-only feedstock material preparation activities and further conversion of intermediate products to finished or semi-finished goods. [6] The data for Category 1, Government Staffed Residential Curbside Collection, was derived through an algorithm based on data points from a variety of sources.

Calculations and values for Private Staffed Residential Curbside Collection are the same as those presented in Note 6, with the exception of Data Label D. For Category 2, Data Label D is ""Percent of Homes Collected by Private Sector."" Throughput is equal to total state recycling collection of all recyclables minus throughput by government staffed curbside collection. Number of establishments for all survey categories is based on the REI study database. In general, data for all survey categories is based on a statistical analysis of survey results. See Section 3.2.2 for a detailed description of survey design and calculations. The number of completed surveys on which results are based is given as ""n."" Number of employees, payroll, and receipts for Compost and Organics Producers are based on a statistical analysis of survey results. Surveys focused on active processing of organic materials for beneficial use. As a result, number of establishments and potential economic activity associated with inactive composting techniques (i.e., allowing materials to slowly and independently decompose over time) may not be fully reflected in totals.  4-10  R. W. Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study [13] [14] [15] [16] Throughput is equal to tons of yard waste recycled as reported by Ohio EPA's 1997 Summary of Solid Waste Management in Ohio report. Number of employees, payroll, and receipts for Materials Recovery Facilities (MRF's) are based on a statistical analysis of survey results. Throughput is derived by multiplying the curbside tons from state reports by percent of material collected that is estimated to go to MRF 's. Data derived from the 1996 U.S. Census Bureau's Standard Statistical Establishments List. See Section 3.2.1.2 for a detailed description of the use of census bureau statistics. Data are taken directly from U.S. Census SSEL for SIC code 5093  Recyclable Material Wholesalers. This category includes a number of different types of businesses including scrap metal and plastics dealers, C&D processors, beneficiation facilities, crumb rubber producers and textile processors. No adjustments were made to Census data since the category is defined as 100 percent recycling-related. Throughput for Recyclable Material Wholesalers is derived as follows: Government Staffed Throughput + Private Staffed Throughput  Compost/Organics Throughput  Materials Recovery Facilities Throughput. (D) indicates that figures cannot be reported in order to avoid disclosure of individual company information. Number of employees, annual payroll, and receipts for Glass Product Producers are based on a statistical analysis of survey results. Throughput is estimated as 76 tons per employee based on a nationwide average of survey responses and Glass Packaging Institute secondary glass use data of 614,000 tons per year nationally. Data for Nonferrous Smelting and Refining Mills is taken from SIC code 3341, Secondary Smelting and Refining. Estimates assume that a sizeable percentage of nonferrous scrap is recovered in secondary nonferrous mills. Throughput for nonferrous smelting and refining is estimated based on national scrap consumption for smelting and refining mills from the 1992 Economic Census, adjusted upward based on employment increases for this category. Data from the 1997 Economic Census were not used because they conform to the new NAICS system, which includes data for making nonferrous metal powder, paste, and flake from purchased nonferrous metals. Allocations to the state-level are on a stateemployment basis. Employment, payroll, and receipts are derived from Column D with an adjustment for the percent of covered activities (95 percent). Number of establishments and throughput are from Column D with no adjustment. Data for Nonferrous Product Producers is taken from U.S. Census SSEL for SIC codes 3351-3355 with no adjustments. Data are derived by multiplying Column C figures by 50 percent, the percentage of establishments assumed to be utilizing scrap or recycled materials, based on comments from U.S.G.S. nonferrous metals specialists. Throughput for Nonferrous Product Producers is estimated based on scrap purchases reported in the 1997 Economic Census. Total tons of scrap for the U.S. is  [17]  [18]  [19] [20] [21]  [22]  [23]  [24]  [25] [26]  [27]  R. W. Beck, Inc.  4-11   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study calculated as: Total Scrap Cost (by SIC) / ($0.45/lb) / (2,000 lbs./ton). Tons of scrap on a state-level is estimated as: Total tons of scrap x State Employees/U.S. Employees. Estimates of employees, payroll, and receipts are derived from Column D with an adjustment for the percent of covered activities (90 percent). Number of establishments and throughput are from Column D with no adjustments. Data for Nonferrous Foundries is taken from U.S. Census SSEL for SIC codes 3363, 3365, 3366, and 3369, with no adjustments. Throughput for Nonferrous Foundries is estimated based on scrap purchases reported in the 1997 Economic Census. Total tons of scrap for the U.S. is calculated as: Total Scrap Cost (by SIC) / ($0.45/lb) / (2,000 lbs./ton). Tons of scrap on a state-level is estimated as: Total tons x State Employees/U.S. Employees. Data for Paper, Paperboard, and Deinked Market Pulp Producers is taken directly from the U.S. Census SSEL for SIC codes 2611, 2621, and 2631, with no adjustments. Establishments, employees, payroll, and revenue figures are derived from Column C by multiplying each data point by the percentage of total pulp, paper, and paperboard mills in the state utilizing recovered paper (as found in Paper Matcher). Throughput is taken from the AF&PA Annual Statistical Summary Recovered Paper Utilization (April, 1999). Throughput numbers used are for 1996 to coincide with the data from U.S. Census SSEL. Data in Column E is derived from Column D based on data from AF&PA Paper Matcher. Number of establishments from Column D is multiplied by 55 percent (national percentage of mills utilizing recovered paper but which do not entirely depend on recovered paper). Employees, payroll, receipts, and throughput from Column D are multiplied by 55 percent and again by 70 percent (average percent of employees involved in covered recyclingrelated activities in mills that are not entirely dependent on recycling). Data in column F is derived from Column D based on data from AF&PA Paper Matcher. Number of establishments, employees, payroll, and receipts from Column D are multiplied by 45 percent (national percentage of mills utilizing recovered paper which are entirely dependent on recovered paper) and again by 95 percent (adjustment for non-covered activities). Throughput is equal to Column D  Column E. Number of employees, payroll, receipts, and throughput for Paper-Based Product Manufacturers are based on a statistical analysis of survey results. Throughput is estimated by multiplying employees times a tons per employee figure (260) derived from a nationwide average of survey responses. Number of employees, payroll, and receipts for Pavement Mix Producers are based on a statistical analysis of survey results. Throughput is estimated by multiplying employees times a tons per employee figure derived from a nationwide average of survey responses.

Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study [40] For Plastics Reclaimers, establishments, employees, and throughput are based on the American Plastics Council Handler & Reclaimer database developed by R.W. Beck. Payroll is calculated by multiplying employment figures by Census Bureau's 1997 average wage for plastics industry employees ($29,120). Estimated receipts is calculated by multiplying throughput of recycled resins produced times an average of recycled resin prices from Plastics News. Establishments, employees, payroll, and receipts in column C for Plastics Converters are obtained from Contribution of Plastics to the U.S. Economy, prepared for the Society of the Plastics Industry by Probe Economics, and multiplied by 84 percent (national employment percentage of the ""industry"" that converts products instead of selling resins, making molds, selling machinery, and wholesaling products). Number of establishments, employees, payroll, and estimated receipts in Column D are derived by multiplying column C figures by the industry-wide recycled-content percentage (5.7 percent) divided by the average recycled content of products that contain recycled materials (35 percent). Throughput is calculated from the state's percentage of national plastics converter employees multiplied by the total tons of plastics recycled nationally (APC Plastics Recycling Rate Study as compiled by R. W. Beck, with additions for pre-consumer plastics recycled). Number of establishments and throughput are directly from Column D. Employees, payroll, and receipts are derived from Column D by multiplying by the estimated percent of employees at recycling-related establishments that are involved in covered recycling-related activities (80 percent). Number of employees, payroll, and receipts for Rubber Product Manufacturers are based on a statistical analysis of survey results. Throughput is estimated by multiplying employees times a tons per employee figure (272) derived from a nationwide average of survey responses. Steel Mill data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau's 1997 Economic Census, Geographic Area Series. Establishments, employees, payroll, and revenue figures are derived from Column C by excluding non-integrated mills, which do not make steel. Throughput is calculated as state's percentage of national steel mill employees multiplied by the total tons of steel scrap consumed (1997 Economic Census) by steel mills nationally. Employment, payroll, and receipts are equal to estimates from Column D multiplied by 95 percent (5 percent deduction to account for downstream conversion). Based on comments from SRI, 100 percent of steel mills are dependent on recovered steel to make new steel, utilizing anywhere from 15 percent-100 percent recovered steel. Therefore, the only deduction taken is to account for noncovered activities. Establishments and throughput are from Column D with no adjustment. For Iron and Steel Foundries, estimates for Column D are taken directly from U.S. Census SSEL with no adjustments. SRI states that all foundries as a matter of practice utilize a significant percentage of scrap in the making of new iron products.  [41]  [42]  [43]  [44]  [45] [46] [47] [48] [49]  [50]  [51]  R.

In Column E, establishments and throughput are taken directly from Column D. Employees, payroll, and receipts from Column D are multiplied by 95 percent, the estimated percent of foundry employees involved in covered recycling-related activities. Number of employees, payroll, and receipts for Other Recycling Processors/Manufacturers are based on a statistical analysis of survey results. Throughput is estimated by multiplying employees times a tons per employee figure (218) derived from a nationwide average of survey responses. Number of employees, payroll, and receipts for Computer and Electronic Appliance Demanufacturers are based on a statistical analysis of survey results.

W. Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study These four categories alone account for 61 percent of all employees, 70 percent of wages, and 74 percent of total receipts. A noticeable distinction exists between the recycling and reuse sectors regarding the size of establishments and average annual payroll. The recycling establishments have an average of 46 employees each, with an average annual payroll per employee of $39,000. Comparatively, the reuse sector is made up of smaller establishments (an average of 7 employees per establishment) with an average annual payroll of $17,000 per employee. Although the reuse and remanufacturing sector comprises 38 percent of total establishments, it makes up only 9 percent of total employees, 4 percent of payroll, and 4 percent of receipts. The methodology used to capture reuse and remanufacturing activity for this report provides a conservative estimate for these sectors. This is because remanufacturing activities are often included with traditional manufacturing industries that were not included in this study. A report entitled The Remanufacturing Industry: Hidden Giant by Professor Robert T. Lund of Boston University estimated remanufacturing activities on a national level, although state or regional-level estimates were not attempted. Extrapolating the figures from that report down to Ohio indicated that reuse and remanufacturing categories may be as much as three times that characterized by this study's methodology. Another important observation can be made by comparing recycling categories that are primarily ""local"" establishments performing collection, sorting, and densification activities to those that source material from large distances for downstream processing, conversion, or manufacturing operations. Local collection and processing (baling, grading, densifying, etc.) includes: Government staffed residential curbside collection; Privately-staffed residential curbside collection; Compost and miscellaneous organics products producers; Materials recovery facilities; and Recyclable material wholesalers. Establishments in the remaining recycling categories are considered to be downstream processors of recycled materials and tend to utilize recycled materials in manufacturing. When the two groups are compared, ""local"" collection and processing make up 13 percent of total recycling employment and 12 percent of receipts whereas non-local downstream processing makes up the remaining 87 percent of employment and 88 percent of receipts. This indicates that public and private investment in local recyclables collection and processing infrastructure pays great dividends in downstream private recycling economic activity. Public policy in the form of state or local laws and regulations that require collection of recyclables or that discourage disposal (e.g., disposal taxes, material specific bans, etc.) directly affects these local public and private sector establishments, and indirectly affects the larger recycling and reuse industry as a whole.

For example, the average wage of the recycling and reuse industry is $36,600  approximately $8,000 per year more than the State's average wage. The industry also composes 1.7 percent of all jobs in the state, and directly contributes to 1.8 percent of Ohio's gross state product. Figures 4-1 and 4-2 show how Ohio's recycling and reuse industry compares to a few other select industries.

The results for categories which used existing U.S. Census data are believed to be the most accurate, followed by data for survey categories, while the derivations are likely to be the least accurate because of the limited amount of available data for estimations. Census data, although updated yearly, lags in publication by three years so that data is not as current as data for survey categories. Survey data is current; however, confidence intervals for total employment, payroll, and receipts for certain categories are quite large because of the small number of establishments in those categories. The study did encounter a number of limitations that impacted the ability to accurately capture all recycling and reuse activity. The limitations of the study include: Survey data asked for intervals rather than discrete numbers; Certain business categories that could be considered part of the recycling and reuse industry were excluded for logistical reasons. Examples include 4-18 R. W. Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study equipment remanufacturers (only national-level data was available) and collectors of commercial and industrial recyclables (very difficult to quantify). Many companies in non-traditional recycling categories, such as fluorescent lamps and carpets, were not easily identifiable and may not be included under any of the categories. Some derivations, such as that for plastics converters, are based on the best of several less-than-desirable options available; it is very difficult to assess the accuracy of those results. Although the study was not able to capture every possible type of recycling and reuse activity, it is reasonably accurate for the categories shown and conservatively estimates the total amount of recycling and reuse activity taking place.

Further calculations were made to estimate selected state government revenues that would be associated with the levels of economic activity that were identified through the modeling process. This section provides an overview of the process of input- output modeling, its strengths, its limitations, and its adaptation to this study. This section also defines the terms used and what the model output data represents. The following section provides the results in tabular form.  5.1.1  INPUT-O  UTPUT  M  ODELING PROCESS AND LIMITATIONS  Economic values or economic effects studies are usually conducted with input- output (IO) econometric models of a regional economy. Input- output modeling allows researchers to investigate the interdependencies that industries, institutions, and households have with each other in a region of study. I- O models, therefore, relate the products made within a region and the products consumed by industries and households in that same region. At a basic level, any industry 's or institution's output (usually its gross sales) requires employees, materials, utilities, capital investments, financing, maintenance, equipment, and service inputs. The probability that a firm purchases its inputs locally (meaning within the region being modeled) is estimated in the I- O model. Estimates of an industry 's inputs mix and whether those inputs are purchased within the region being modeled are based on national and regional industrial surveys. Primary survey information to update the national or regional statistics is needed to improve the quality of the model output, particularly where the industry segment under study may differ from national or regional averages. As was discussed previously in the Study Methodology section, this study performed limited surveys to obtain additional intermediate input data. Furthermore, it made use of in-house data from previous county-level and state-level modeling projects to further improve the quality of the model that was produced. There are important limitations to these models that must be acknowledged. First and foremost, absent highly detailed and costly local industry surveys, which was not done for this study, national and regional averages for major industrial input categories (the production functions) and the likelihood of a local purchase of inputs for the industries that were studied (regional purchasing coefficients) were still heavily relied on. Industries that fall within general industrial categories normally have very similar industrial input characteristics. A plastics firm that produces finished goods from recycled stock will be configured very similarly to a plastics firm that produces goods primarily from virgin inputs. Except for the source of their commodity input into production and the physical configuration of their processing machinery, their overall remaining operational  R. W. Beck, Inc.  5-1   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study characteristics  transportation, utilities, services, maintenance, financial inputs, etc.  are likely to be very similar. Consequently, in most instances, production characteristics of existing firms in the state of study provided a very good first pass at identifying intraregional linkages and supply chains of goods and services required for production. Although the I-O model has information on up to 537 industries, there is no specific set of ""recycling and reuse"" industries. Consequently, the models that were produced were significantly modified to accept recycling and reuse industries distinctly. Furthermore, the use of in-house data and additional surveys for select recycling and reuse industries enhanced the quality of the model output for this study.  Other limits in these types of models include: Difficulties in capturing economies of scale, particularly for industries with relatively small numbers of establishments, where establishment-toestablishment variation may be significant (the current input values or production functions are, therefore, initially constant); An inability to identify input substitutes  especially in new technologies or in instances where input modes have changed; Dated data on industrial performance and purchases, particularly for industries that are newly-emerging or rapidly changing; In-state and out-of-state purchases of commodities within a study area are fixed (regional purchasing coefficients must be adjusted if it is suspected that the regional averages are not right); and An implicit assumption that input commodity supply is infinite and perfectly elastic. I- O models, therefore, are just that  models  that simulate industrial interdependencies in the current economy under study. I- O models are not necessarily good models for forecasting because they model the existing economy, and do not forecast the net impact of replacing a virgin-commodity establishment with a recycled-commodity establishment, for example. Furthermore, the results for one region reflect the economy of that particular region and generally are not transferable to other regions. I- O models, therefore, have limits. Nevertheless, I- O models are comparably much less expensive to produce than more involved models, and do an excellent job of estimating the role a particular industry has (such as the recycling industry) on a specific economy. The generic term ""economic impact"" is frequently used to describe a set of economic activities in a region. This term often suffers from serious misapplication. There are several kinds of economic activities that may occur within a particular region. For example: Firms may produce goods or provide services for export outside the region. They attract outside funds into the region that supports employment, industrial purchases, and household spending.  5 -2  R. W. Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study Firms may substitute locally produced commodity inputs for those that previously were purchased from outside the region. In this case funds are retained in the region and flow to local suppliers to an industry. Firms may produce goods and services for local consumption (either by industries or by households). Although they may help to retain funds in the region, they may not cause significant additional economic activity. I- O models identify the overall size and contribution of an industry  its economic effect or economic value  to the area mix of economic activity along with interdependencies that exist between it and other firms or service suppliers. In other words, the strength of linkages that exist among industries and the overall value (output, incomes, and jobs) of their production. The impact of an industry hasn't yet been determined. In the case of firms that produce finished goods for export outside a region, there is a measurable economic impact  were it not for the external demand for the locallyproduced product, the economic activity would not be in the local economy. A much harder measure of potential economic impact falls into the category of import substitution. If a region is able to develop indigenous industries that produce a good that substitutes for a good that is imported, then that industry is retaining dollars in the state that used to be exported. An industry that produces a good using recycled feedstock that is supplied locally will create a product that substitutes local inputs for non-local inputs. Recycling industries often fit into the import substitution category, particularly in states without virgin feedstock production infrastructures. By utilizing recycled content, they are purchasing locally and, therefore, stimulating indigenous economic activity. This study generally reserves the use of the term economic impact only for industries that have verifiable levels of exports  where the output that they are producing is a genuine and real increase in industrial output for the region of study  or for true import substitutes. To claim economic impacts over and above those just mentioned would involve much more extensive industrial measures for each category of establishments that was assessed in this study, and over a period of time. This study does, however, isolate total economic values  estimates, by category, of the value of economic interrelationships that exist in Ohio for the industries. These values are the intrinsic worth of a set of industrial activities to Ohio. They represent a slice of the economic pie from a particular point of view. In summary, economic models are and only can be estimates of inter-industrial linkages and regional values. They are based on an amalgam of federal, county, and state data, academic procedures, along with some survey-derived direct data, all compiled with due diligence for accuracy and reasonableness. Consequently, although an inter-industrial accounting framework is implied, all estimates are simulations of economic values based on the data employed and the assumptions implicit in the modeling.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  5-3   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study 5.1.2 K INDS OF ECONOMIC INFORMATION PRODUCED BY  I-O M  ODELS  Input- output models produce many kinds of data for analysis and decision making. The more useful results for industrial leaders, planners, and policy makers are estimates of (1) total industrial output, (2) personal income, (3) value added, and (4) jobs. These are the categories of economic activity that are reported in detail in the data tables that follow this section. These terms are defined below: Total industrial output for most private industries is simply gross sales. For public or quasi-public institutions this normally includes all public outlays, along with the value of government sales and other subsidies received, to isolate the current economic value of their output to the citizens or the area served. Personal income includes the wages and salaries of employees and proprietors, normal profits to sole proprietors, and an estimate of the cash value of all benefits (e.g., social insurance, retirement, and medical benefits). Value added is a measure of gross regional product. It includes all personal income (employment compensation, incomes to sole proprietors) plus property incomes (dividends, interests, and rents), and indirect tax payments (primarily excise and sales taxes paid by individuals to businesses). Jobs is the number of full- and part-time positions in the economy, not the number of full time equivalents.18 This distinction is important because the relationship between job growth and labor force growth is very different in different industries. Some industries rely heavily on semi-skilled part-time labor. Other industries generally only produce full-time skilled jobs. It is always important, when possible, to quantitatively assess whether the jobs that are stimulated are part-time or full-time or higher-paying versus lower-paying. Economic data is further reported as direct, indirect, induced, and total economic effects. Direct effects refer to the operational characteristics of the firms or institutions that are studied. This study measured the apparent value of twenty-six categories of recycling and reuse establishments. The direct output of these entities is, therefore, their reported gross sales. The direct jobs are the jobs that are associated with those establishments. The direct personal income contains their reported payments to all employees, plus an additional estimate of benefit values and of returns to sole proprietors. The estimate of benefit values and returns to sole proprietors were based on industrial averages in industries that are similar to the recycling and reuse industries included in this study. Indirect effects measure the value of additional economic demands that the direct firms or institutions place on supplying industries in the region. When firms produce goods or conduct business or when public entities provide public goods or services, they must make many purchases. Some of these are from suppliers in the area. Some are not. Public utilities, communications systems, fuel, wholesale goods and services, manufactured goods, financial and legal 18 For example, a restaurant may employ 20 people on a half-time basis (20 jobs) to fill its labor requirement of 10 full-time-equivalents.  5 -4  R. W. Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study services, raw and processed commodities, and a variety of professional services are necessary to produce the direct values described above. Induced effects accrue when workers in the direct and indirect industries spend their earnings on goods and services in the region. Induced effects can also be called household effects, and the terms are often used inter-changeably. When workers in direct and indirect industries purchase goods and services for household consumption, they, in turn, stimulate another layer of the economy. Most induced activity accrues to retail, services, and finance, insurance, and housing spending. Because employment is stimulated in these industries as well, their demands for inputs increase, yielding an additional round or additional rounds of indirect purchases and additional rounds of induced activity. The I-O models solve for these iterative rounds of transactions until all of the possible inter-industrial transactions have been accumulated. Total economic effects are the sum of direct, indirect, and induced effects. They are all of the transactions attributable, either directly or indirectly, to the activities of establishments in the business categories included in this study. The term multiplier or multiplier effect is frequently used when referring to economic effects or economic impacts. There are different kinds of multipliers  this study reports two types. The Type I multiplier identifies the value of direct and indirect transactions  e.g., the output of a business category and all other output that it purchases from its suppliers in the region  relative to the value of only the direct transactions. The Type II multiplier identifies the value of all economic transactions (direct, indirect, and induced) that are stimulated in the economy by an industry under study, including the personal spending of employees throughout the supply chain whose economic activity is apportioned to the industry, relative to the value of only the direct transactions.  5.2 R  ESULTS  Table 5-1 shows estimates of economic activity accruing to establishments in business categories that provide goods or services to recycling and reuse industry establishments. The category Other Indirect Establishments shown in the table includes all other indirect establishments that provide goods or services (such as office supply companies, accounting firms, legal firms, building and landscape maintenance firms, etc.). It is important to note that the data for Recycling and Reuse Equipment Manufacturers is based on a statistical analysis of survey data and therefore represents complete data for those types of establishments located in a state regardless of where they sell their equipment. Totals for the other categories represent indirect activity relating to only the 26 categories of recycling and reuse industry establishments located in Ohio that were investigated for this study.

W. Beck, Inc.  5-9   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study  5.3 I  NTERPRETATION OF  R  ESULTS  This section is intended to aid readers in interpreting the results of the tables in the previous section. Economic values are most accurate at the business category level. Summing totals by groups of recycling or reuse activity for the state as a whole (as has been done in the tables) results in some degree of duplicated accounting of economic activity. This is true for any set of industrial assessments in any input- output modeling scenario  it is not a problem with recycling, per se, nor with this study, but arises simply because of the many business categories that are included in this study. For example, direct sales by a raw commodity processor represent an input purchase by an industry producing a finished good for sale. A large portion of the raw commodity processor's direct sales is already reflected in the finished good industry's input purchases. In this case, then, aggregation biases the economic values in the subtotals and totals upwards. As a general rule, the higher the Type I multiplier (which is a measure of how strongly a firm depends on supplier inputs), the higher the probability of aggregation bias in reporting subtotals and totals. This is an inherent ""Catch 22"" in input- output modeling: to eliminate aggregation bias of this sort, the industries must be lumped together in the construction of the model so that inter-industrial transactions are properly accounted and the resulting multipliers are properly dampened. Doing so, however, eliminates the industrial detail that is desired. Nevertheless, subtotals and totals have been produced so that relative comparisons can be made. Users of these findings, however, must be cautious to avoid claims about the recycling and reuse industry that may be unwarranted given that there is some degree of inflation in the subtotals or totals. Based on other modeling experience, it is believed that aggregation bias may have inflated the subtotals and totals by up to 15 percent, and possibly higher. It is important to note that this bias is associated with any total that is derived from indirect and induced information, including total economic activity, subtotal/total multipliers, and total government tax revenues. Alternatively, totals derived only from direct infor mation and gover nment tax revenues derived from direct economic activity do not include bias. Multipliers reveal potential changes in the regional economy attributable to a change in direct activity in a particular industry in that same economy. Multipliers can be instructive for anticipating economic growth, in the case of a new or expanding firm, and economic decline, in the case of a plant closing. Economic multipliers are often misunderstood and therefore improperly used. Developers, planners, and decisionmakers frequently use national level multipliers that are produced by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) as points of comparison. These multipliers are called RIMS II (Regional Input- Output Multiplier System), and they are widely used by development groups to support economic investment or public spending. Multipliers are available for over 500 industries in the categories of earnings, employment, and industrial output. Many users, however, mistakenly apply these statistics because they:  5-10  R. W. Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study Fail to account for regional production and cost of living differences (detailed multipliers are available at the state and county level, but project promoters often rely on national averages due to costs); Use the wrong multiplier to describe a phenomenon (multipliers for different categories of economic activity can vary substantially); or Seek to promote industries with the largest multipliers possible without consideration of either the appropriateness of the application or of the actual scope of local production. The reader can be assured that this study produced Type I and Type II multipliers that are specific to Ohio and are not directly derivative of national averages. Before making any comparisons among multipliers, it is important to understand what influences them. Firms with strong linkages to area supplying firms or that pay relatively high wages may yield comparatively higher multipliers. Firms that are otherwise not linked strongly to local suppliers or that pay lower than average wages will usually produce lower multipliers. More urbanized areas and states with larger and more diversified economies have, on the average, much higher multipliers than less populated, more rural states for the same types of businesses. Given the above guides to interpreting the data, there are several general conclusions that can be drawn from the results: Ohio steel mills, wood reuse, and other reuse establishments tended to have higher multipliers than establishments in other recycling and reuse business categories. Ohio recycling and reuse industry multipliers compare favorably to multipliers of other broad industrial sectors of the State's economy, in many cases exceeding them. Investments in local recycling collection and processing and policies that encourage recycling and reuse yield significant total state government revenues from taxes, charges, fees, and miscellaneous revenues. For example, 88 percent of Ohio's total recycling industry tax revenues arise from recycling manufacturing establishments and their indirect and induced economic activity.  R. W.

Beck, Inc.   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study  6 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE STUDIES This section summarizes the recommendations for replicating the study in future years. Recommendations are: Carefully review changes in definitions from the SIC classification system to the NAICS system when utilizing U.S. Census data. Whereas this study utilized data based on the SIC system, future studies will need to utilize data based on NAICS. Although definitions for most categories remain unchanged, changes to a few categories are worth noting. For example, the SIC system classifies materials recovery facilities (MRFs) under SIC 4953, Refuse Systems, which includes landfills and other waste handling facilities. The new NAICS system code, 56292, is specifically for MRFs. Therefore, the data for MRFs may be gathered by examining Census data rather than through surveys. An example of a category for which it may be more difficult to utilize existing data is nonferrous secondary smelting and refining mills. The NAICS definition for this category includes a few miscellaneous activities, such as alloying of zinc paste, that were not included in the SIC definition and should not be included in estimates of recycling-related activities. Narrow the definition of compost and organics producers and find listings of facilities through sources other than the Downing and Associates list19. Although the Downing and Associates list was thorough and complete, the definition of compost and organics was very broad, resulting in a large number of listings that were municipal mulching operations or only a small portion of a larger facility, such as a MRF or transfer station. BioCycle regularly publishes lists of various types of composting programs. Although it typically publishes only the program name, city, and state, it may be possible to make special arrangements to gain more detailed contact information. Make every attempt before mailing surveys to correctly classify establishments. Due to the diverse nature of the sources used to compile the database and the lack of classification for some electronic lists, a large number of establishments were misclassified, resulting in additional efforts during the surveying process and a smaller number of establishments in some categories than was initially expected. Redesign the survey form to allow one establishment to be classified in more than one category and allow the employment, payroll, and receipts amounts to be divided among the selected categories. Conduct more and better research on the industrial characteristics of recycling and reuse firms to improve the explanatory power of I-O models. This research should focus on the following areas:  19  Please refer to Appendix B for a listing and evaluation of all sources used.  R. W. Beck, Inc.  6-1   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study Improving input-output tables (use, make, total requirements) for critical recycling and reuse industries so that inter-industrial transactions are better understood. Furthermore, constructing similar tables for non-recycling industries will allow better comparisons between recycling and nonrecycling businesses. Tracking the throughput of major recycling commodities at state levels to the production of a final industrial or household good. For many industries there is not good information on the propensity of recyclables being purchased, processed, and manufactured into a consumer good within a state or region. Identifying critical costs associated with the flow of recycled products into goods for final use. Finally, follow-up studies that would be useful should be considered, including: Additional research to better document intermediate input statistics for recycling businesses and to enable comparisons between recycling and nonrecycling businesses in the same industry; Estimating the amount of economic activity that can be attributed to public policy since House Bill 592 was passed in 1988; and Determining the amount of growth over today's baseline (as measured through this report) that could be realized by additional levels of recycling and reuse.  6 -2  R. W. Beck, Inc.   APPENDIX A DESCRIPTION OF RECYCLING AND REUSE BUSINESS CATEGORIES Table A-1 provides detailed descriptions of 30 recycling and reuse business categories, grouped into 3 industry segments. The table is intended to comprehensively include all business establishments undertaking recycling and reuse economic activities, as defined in Section 2. Note that recycling processors and manufacturers are grouped into a single industry segment. This is because many of the establishments in these categories undertake both processing and manufacturing. Table A-1 lists Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes for each category. These codes were identified by comparing each category to the official definitions listed in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1987, prepared by the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget. Note that in most cases, the listed SIC category also includes businesses not involved in recycling and reuse. Beginning in 1997 the SIC system will gradually be phased out and replaced by the new North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which is harmonious with systems used in Mexico and Canada, in accordance with the North American Free Trade Agreement. Table A-1 also lists the NAICS codes that correspond to the traditional SIC codes. Where the NAICS categories differ significantly, the new category name is provided. Notable changes in the NAICS system include a new category for material recovery facilities, and a division of SIC 4953, Refuse Systems into separate categories for haulers and disposal facility operators handling hazardous, solid and other wastes.

Survey data on three variables (number of employees, payroll, and receipts) provided the primary information analyzed. Survey information obtained from 350 establishments was used to estimate the number of employees1 involved in recycling activities, as well as the dollar value of recycling payroll and receipts. Based on initial estimates and survey participation responses, R. W. Beck estimated the total number of establishments engaged in recycling activities in the state of Ohio for each of thirteen survey categories. In Ohio, 581 establishments are believed to be involved in recycling activities in these categories. The procedure for estimating the total number of establishments in each category consisted of several steps. From the initial count of businesses in each category, a random sample was developed. After examining the survey responses, those that were unrelated, unreachable, duplicate, or out of business were eliminated. Those businesses that were either completely or partially responsive to the survey, as well as those that declined to participate or were uncooperative were counted. Further adjustments were made for businesses that changed from one category to another. The following example will illustrate the procedure used to develop the final estimate of 241 establishments in category 3, compost and organics processors:   From the initial list of 419 businesses that were classified as potentially being compost and organics processors, a random sample of 400 was contacted; Of these 400, 12 establishments moved out of this recycling category, 24 moved into the category (from other categories) and 186 were eliminated (unrelated, unreachable, duplicate entries, or out of business), leaving 226 establishments in this category. To these 226, we added 15 additional establishments, based on the observed ""success"" rate of the attempted sample and the relative amount of establishments that moved into the category, for a total of 241 establishments.2    For each variable (employment, payroll, and receipts), the sample mean, standard deviation, and other related statistics were calculated. Based on the sample size and estimate of the total number of establishments engaged in recycling in this business category, ranges were constructed that should contain the true average value for the 1  Employee responses were adjusted to a full-time equivalent basis. Thus, two employees each working 50% on recycling activities would be counted as one employee. Of the 400 establishments we attempted to contact in this category, only 202 correctly belonged in the category. We applied this 51% ""success"" ratio to the 19 establishments not contacted of the originally estimated 419 establishments, adding 10 establishments. Furthermore, we added another 5 establishments through allocation from a group of unclassified establishments, based on the relative proportion of unclassified establishments that completed a survey and properly belonged in the compost and organics producers category.  2  R. W. Beck, Inc.  E-1   Ohio Recycling Economic Information Study  typical recycling business in the category3. Finally, by multiplying this range by the estimate of the total number of recycling businesses in the category, we obtain a range for the total values for each variable. Continuing with the previous example, the analysis was as follows:    131 establishments provided complete employment, payroll, and receipts data; Average number of employees, payroll, and receipts for these 131 responses was calculated; Standard deviations and other related statistics necessary to determine a 95% confidence interval for the average of all establishments in this business category was calculated; and The low, average, and high values for the confidence interval were then multiplied by the estimated total establishments in this category (241) to yield the estimated range of the total number of employees, payroll, and receipts.    To finish this particular example, the sample of 131 establishments employed (on average) 5.2 persons per establishment in recycling activities on a full-time equivalent basis. However, given the sample size and the estimate of the total number of establishments in this business category, the actual average number of employees per establishment might range from a low of 4.3 to a high of 6.1. Thus, while 1,248 employees are expected to be involved in recycling activities for the entire set of 241 establishments in this business category, there may be as few as 1,030 or as many as 1,467. Another point should also be made regarding small population sampling as it applies to certain categories. Given the small number of total establishments engaged in certain business categories at the state level, the low end of the estimates is often constrained by the fact that it cannot be less than the value already observed in the sample itself. For paper-based product manufacturers, for example, the expected value of 1,807 total employees is bounded by a low estimate of 602 because it is already known, through survey data, that 602 employees work for the establishments sampled in this category. As this issue affects the results, it serves to make certain estimates more accurate than would otherwise be possible. For example, in the most extreme cases, all the establishments believed to exist in a given business category were surveyed. For these cases, the exact number of people employed, payrolls, and receipts are known because the entire relevant population was surveyed.  3  Technically speaking, these ranges can be described as 95% confidence intervals.

All Other Employees  Non-production employees including those engaged in factory supervision above the line-supervisor level. It includes sales (including driversalespersons), sales delivery (highway truck drivers and their helpers), advertising, credit, collection, installation and servicing of own products, clerical and routine office functions, executive, purchasing, financing, legal, personnel (including cafeteria, medical, etc.), professional, and technical employees. Annual Payroll  Total annual payroll includes all forms of compensation, such as salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation allowances, sick-leave pay, and the value of payments in kind (e.g., free meals and lodgings) paid during the year to all employees. APC  American Plastics Council. Covered Activities  Defined as all activities that support:      Transforming pre-consumer scrap materials or post-consumer products into a recycled material; Transforming recycled materials into a first intermediate product (e.g., sheet, fiber, roll); Transforming recycled materials directly into a finished product; Preparing used products for reuse; and Manufacturing equipment for the recycling or reuse industries.  Covered activities do not include converting a first intermediate product to finished or semi-finished products or preparing materials for fuel use. Direct Effects  Refers to the operational characteristics of the firms or institutions that are studied. This study measured the apparent value of twenty-six categories of recycling and reuse establishments. The direct output of these entities is, therefore, their reported gross sales. The direct jobs are the jobs that the firms that were surveyed in the states listed. The direct personal income contains their reported payments to all employees, plus an additional estimate of benefit values and of returns to sole proprietors. The estimate of benefit values and returns to sole proprietors were based on industrial averages in industries that are similar to the recycling and reuse industries included in this study. Employment  Employment consists of paid full and part-time employees (counted at equal weight), including salaried officers and executives of corporations. Included are employees on sick leave, holidays, and vacations; not included are volunteers, proprietors and partners of unincorporated businesses.  R. W. Beck, Inc.

Establishments may government operated as well as privately operated. GPI  Glass Packaging Institute. I-O  Input-Output, in relation to economic modeling, refers to econometric models that are based on inter-industrial accounts data that identify the products made within a region and the products consumed by industries and households in that same region. Any industry's or institution's output (usually its gross sales) requires inputs in the form of employees, materials, utilities, capital investments, financing, maintenance, equipment, and services. The probability that a firm purchases its inputs locally is estimated in the I-O model. Indirect Effects  A measurement of the value of additional economic demands that direct firms or institutions place on supplying industries in a region under study. When firms produce goods or conduct business or when public entities provide public goods or services, they must make many purchases. Some of these are from suppliers in the area. Some are not. Public utilities, communications systems, fuel, wholesale goods and services, manufactured goods, financial and legal services, raw and processed commodities, and a variety of professional services are necessary to produce the output of direct establishments. IMPLAN  A basic input-output economic modeling program used in this study that is published by the Minnesota IMPLAN Group, Inc. Induced Effects  These effects accrue when workers in direct and indirect industries spend their earnings on goods and services in the region. Induced effects can also be called household effects, and the terms are often used interchangeably. When workers in direct and indirect industries purchase goods and services for household consumption, they, in turn, stimulate another layer of the economy. Most induced activity accrues to retail, services, finance, insurance, and housing spending. Because employment is stimulated in these industries as well, their demands for inputs increase, yielding an additional round or additional rounds of indirect purchases and additional rounds of induced activity. ISRI  Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries. Jobs  The number of paid full- and part-time positions (counted at equal weight), not the number of full time equivalents. Multiplier or Multiplier Effect  A term used when referring to economic effects or economic impacts. There are different kinds of multipliers -- this study reports two types. The Type I multiplier identifies the value of direct and indirect transactions -- e.g., the output of a business category and all other output that it purchases from its suppliers in the region  relative to the value of only the direct transactions. The Type II multiplier identifies the value of all economic transactions (direct, indirect, and induced) that are stimulated in the economy by an industry under study, including the personal spending  F-2  R.

EPA estimates that approximately          13.5 percent of textiles in clothing, sheets, and pillowcases was recovered          for export or reprocessing in 2000. Handling this load are the more than          500 textile recycling companies in the United States, most of which are          family-owned businesses that employ 35 to 50 people, according to the          Institute for Local Self-Reliance. The Council for Textile Recycling estimates          that 48 percent of reclaimed textiles are reused as second-hand clothing,          20 percent become wiping and polishing cloths, and the remaining 26 percent          are converted into fiber to be used in new textile products. The industry          employs approximately 10,000 semi-skilled workers at the primary processing          level and creates an additional 7,000 jobs at the final processing stage.          Primary and secondary processors account for annual gross sales of $400          million and $300 million, respectively.         More than 61 percent of textiles that are collected for reuse or          recycling are exported to foreign countries. Thus, the strength of the          textile recycling industry is largely dependent on those frequently volatile          economies. In addition, despite record demand for textiles, the industry          has been downsizing as a result of insufficient supply. Experts cite increased          municipal recycling of textiles as a critical strategy to increase supply.          Currently, successful community recycling programs range from curbside          collection to drop off centers, often partnering with local charities          and nonprofit organizations. With end users paying between $80 to $160          per ton for the recovered textiles, revenues are covering most communities'          textile processing costs. Therefore, additional education is needed to          increase the tonnages collected through municipal and county programs.         Although it is still in the early stages of development, carpet          recycling is a key area of growth in the textile industry. Carpet recycling          can include refurbishment, recycling carpet into new carpet face fiber,          manufacturing fibers into other plastic products and carpet backing into          new backing, or producing a recycled-content carpet backing by melting          different types of backing and fiber materials together. Barriers to carpet          recycling include its bulkiness and the typically long distances to markets,          which can make it difficult to cost-effectively recycle. Also, carpet          fibers and backing are comprised of a wide variety of materials, making          it difficult to develop standard recycling technologies.                                                                                                                                                                          EPA Home  |  Privacy          and Security Notice  |                               Contact Us
GX252-05-4050012	"Order Code RL30395  CRS Report for Congress Received through the CRS Web  Farm Labor Shortages and Immigration Policy  Updated September 6, 2001  Linda Levine Specialist in Labor Economics Domestic Social Policy Division  Congressional Research Service ~ The Library of Congress   Farm Labor Shortages and Immigration Policy Summary The connection between farm labor and immigration policies has re-emerged as an issue in the Congress and is under discussion by the Bush and Fox Administrations. Questions have arisen about whether enough workers are available domestically to meet the labor requirements of crop growers and how, if at all, the Congress should change immigration policy, which has long been linked with the seasonal needs of crop producers for direct-hire and contract farmworkers. Slightly more than half of today's farmworkers are not legally eligible to hold U.S. jobs. Growers are concerned that if certain federal activities are effective, they could lose a considerable portion of their labor force and hence of their livelihood. These federal actions include increased border enforcement efforts, work eligibility verification pilot programs and audits of employees' work authorization documents to determine their authenticity. In addition, the Social Security Administration has more often been sending letters that notify employers of mismatches between their employees' names/social security numbers and those in SSA's database in order to properly credit earnings to employee records. Growers contend that the sizeable presence of illegal aliens implies a shortage of legal farmworkers. Their advocacy groups argue that growers would rather not employ unauthorized workers because doing so puts them at risk of incurring penalties. Farmworker advocates counter that crop producers prefer illegal to legal employees because the former are in a weaker bargaining position with regard to wages and working conditions. If the supply of illegal workers were curtailed, it is claimed, growers could adjust to a smaller legal workforce by introducing laborefficient technologies and management practices, and by raising wages, which, in turn, would entice more legal workers to become farmworkers. Grower advocates respond that further mechanization would be difficult for some crops and that substantially higher wages would make the U.S. industry uncompetitive in the world marketplace without expanding the legal farm labor force. These remain untested arguments, as perishable crop growers have rarely, if ever, operated without illegal aliens in their workforces. At the present time, trends in the farm labor market generally do not suggest the existence of a nationwide shortage of domestically available farmworkers, in part because the government's databases cover legal and illegal employment. (This finding does not preclude the possibility of spot labor shortages, however.) Hired and contract farm employment generally has declined, in contrast to total U.S. employment, since 1990. The length of time hired workers are employed on farms has shown little change or decreased over the years, depending on the measure examined. The unemployment rate of hired farmworkers has varied little and remains much higher than the overall average. Underemployment among farmworkers remains substantial. And, although two data series show different levels and trends in the wages of field workers, the data do concur that these employees earn about 50 cents for every dollar paid to other private-sector employees.   Contents Illegal Farmworkers and Activities of the SSA and INS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 The Composition of the Seasonal Farm Labor Force . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 A Farm Labor Shortage?

Immigration policy has long been intertwined with the labor needs of crop (e.g., fruit and vegetable) growers, who rely more than most farmers on hand labor (e.g., for harvesting) and consequently ""are the largest users of hired and contract workers on a per-farm basis.""2 Since World War I, the Congress has allowed the use of temporary foreign workers to perform agricultural labor of a seasonal nature as a means of augmenting the supply of domestic farmworkers.3 In addition, a sizeable fraction of immigrants historically have found employment on the nation's farms.4 The intersection between farm labor and immigration has again emerged as a policy issue in the Congress,5 and it is one of the topics under discussion by members of the Bush and Fox Administrations. This report first explains why the nexus between farm labor shortages and immigration policy has again arisen. It next examines the composition of the seasonal agricultural labor force and presents the arguments of grower and farmworker advocates concerning its adequacy relative to employer demand. The report closes with an analysis of the trends in (un)employment, time worked and wages of legal and illegal farmworkers to determine if they are consistent with the existence of a nationwide shortage of domestically available farmworkers.  In this report, the terms ""agriculture"" and ""farming"" will be used interchangeably as will the terms ""producer,"" ""grower,"" and ""farmer."" Oliveira, Victor J., with Anne B. W.

Collver. 5   CRS-2  Illegal Farmworkers and Activities of the SSA and INS For the past several years, attention has focused on the growing share of the domestic supply of farmworkers that is composed of aliens who are not authorized to work in the United States. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) estimated that foreign-born persons in the country illegally accounted for 37% of the domestic crop workforce in FY1994-1995. Shortly thereafter (FY1997-1998), unauthorized aliens' share of the estimated 1.8 million workers employed on crop farms reached 51.5%.6 Although a number of studies have found that no nationwide shortage of domestic farm labor exists,7 a case is being made that the considerable presence of illegal aliens in the seasonal agricultural labor force implies a lack of legal farmworkers relative to employer demand. Arguably, the purported imbalance between authorized-to-work farm labor and employer demand would become more apparent were the supply of illegal aliens curtailed sufficiently -- a fear that has plagued growers over the years. Crop producers reportedly believe the latest risk of losing much of their labor force comes from a number of activities being pursued, in some cases independently, and in others jointly, by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). These activities are described below: (1) Since about 1997, the SSA has more often been sending employers ""educational correspondence"" that includes a sample of mismatches between the names/social security numbers (SSNs) that appear on the W-2 forms employers must submit to the agency annually and those in the SSA's database. The purpose of the  According to U.S. Department of Labor Report to Congress: The Agricultural Labor Market -- Status and Recommendations, the 1.8 million figure was developed by dividing the hourly earnings of field and livestock workers into farm labor expenditures to estimate the number of work hours on crop and livestock farms. As it was calculated that 72% of the hours were being worked on crop farms, the percentage was then applied to the Commission on Agricultural Workers' estimate for 1992 of 2.5 million persons employed for wages on U.S. farms to yield a current estimate of the hired crop workforce. The Commission had developed its earlier farm employment figure from a variety of data sources because there is no actual head count of farmworkers. For other current estimates of hired farm and crop workers see Table 1. 6  Commission on Agricultural Workers. Report of the Commission on Agricultural Workers.

Growers have told the SSA that their concern with using the EVS is that when they then discuss any discrepancies with employees, the employees do not return to work. Farmers are also fearful that if they do not act on the SSA letters, they may be liable for penalties (commonly referred to as employer sanctions) due to ""constructive knowledge"" of illegal workers on their payrolls.9 But, the agency's correspondence clearly states that there are many reasons why discrepancies can occur10 and that the letter, by itself, should not form the basis for taking any adverse actions against employees. (2) The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA, P.L. 104-288) provided for increased border enforcement efforts and for employment verification pilot programs.11 Although these programs are voluntary for private employers in a limited number of test areas and are set to last no longer than 4 years, growers believe that their inclusion in P.L. 104-288 has merely delayed the creation of a mandatory nationwide verification system.12 Currently, employers fulfill the legal requirement to not knowingly hire illegal workers by viewing documents that show the new-hire's identity and eligibility to work in the United States, and by completing an I-9 (employment eligibility verification) form. Under the Basic Pilot Program, for example, employers can access the SSA or INS databases to validate a newly hired citizen's or non-citizen's eligibility to work. If employers receive a final nonconfirmation of employment eligibility, they must either fire the new-hire or be subject to financial penalties. The U.S. General Accounting Office reported in 1997 that neither the INS pilot programs nor its border  8 9  Conversations with SSA staff.  Aleinikoff, T. Alexander. The Green Card Solution.

Note: In addition to potential fines under immigration law, the Internal Revenue Service may charge employers or employees $50 for providing incorrect information on W-2 forms. However, this does not often occur according to the SSA. 10  The SSA provides the following examples in its letters of why mismatches might occur: record transcription or typographical errors, incomplete or blank names or SSNs, or name changes. 11  Work eligibility verification demonstrations in addition to the IIRIRA pilots are authorized under Section 274A(d)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and Presidential Executive Order 12781 of November 20, 1991.

In the audits, the INS checks the authenticity of employees' work authorization documents against government records. At the audits' completion, the INS gives employers a list of employees whose documents were deemed to be invalid. According to a representative of the growers, ""Frequently, INS audits of agricultural employers reveal that 60 to 70 percent of seasonal agricultural workers have provided fraudulent documents. The employer is then required to dismiss each employee on the list who cannot provide a valid employment authorization document, something few workers can do.""14 This estimate of hired farmworkers who have secured their jobs through presentation of fraudulent documents is at the high end of figures reported elsewhere.15 Growers are concerned that these SSA and INS activities already have disrupted their workforces by increasing employee turnover and therefore, decreasing the stability of their labor supply. The perception that government actions might negatively impact the agricultural workforce -- allegedly to the extent that crops would not be harvested, farmers would go bankrupt or produce costs to U.S. consumers would rise -- has prompted a legislative response in the past.  The Composition of the Seasonal Farm Labor Force Immigration legislation sometimes has been crafted to take into account the purported labor requirements of U.S. crop growers. In 1986, for example, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA, P.L. 99-603) to curb the presence of illegal aliens in the United States by imposing sanctions on employers who knowingly hire individuals who lack permission to work in the country. In addition to a general legalization program, P.L. 99-603 included two industry-specific legalization programs -- the Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) program and the Replenishment Agricultural Worker (RAW) program16 -- that were intended to compensate for the Act's expected impact on the farm labor supply and encourage the  13 14  GAO, H-2A Agricultural Guestworker Program.

Status Report: Hired Farm Labor in U.S. Agriculture. Agricultural Outlook, October 1998. 16  The INS approved over 1 million of the applications that individuals filed under the SAW program to become legal permanent residents. Anticipating that SAWs would leave farming because IRCA did not require them to remain in order to adjust their status, P.L. 99-603 included the RAW program as a back-up measure to ensure growers of an adequate labor supply. The RAW program was never used because the annual calculations of farm labor supply and demand that were made by the U.S. Departments of Labor and Agriculture during the FY1990-1993 period found no national shortages of farmworkers.   CRS-5 development of a legal crop workforce. These provisions of the Act have not operated in the offsetting manner that was intended, however, as substantial numbers of illegal aliens have continued to join legal farmworkers in performing seasonal agricultural services (SAS).17 On the basis of case studies that it sponsored, the Commission on Agricultural Workers concluded in its 1992 report that individuals legalized under the SAW program (i.e., SAWs) and other farmworkers planned to remain in the agricultural labor force ""indefinitely, or for as long as they are physically able.""18 According to the DOL's Natio nal Agricultural Workers Survey, two-thirds of SAWs stated that they intended to engage in field work until the end of their working lives.19 For many SAWs, the end of their worklives -- at least their worklives in farming -- may now be near at hand. The diminished physical ability generally associated with aging in combination with the taxing nature of crop tasks could well be prompting greater numbers of SAWs to leave the fields. Relatively few farmworkers are involved in crop production beyond the age of 44 and even fewer beyond the age of 55 (9% and 6%, respectively, in FY1997-1998).20 The Commission on Agricultural Workers noted that the typical SAW in 1990 was a 30-year-old male who ""is likely to remain in farm work well into the 21st century.""21 He is now closer to the age of diminished participation in SAS labor: in FY1997-1998, the average age of SAWs was 39, older than U.S.-born farmworkers (32) and unauthorized farmworkers (27).22 Thus, the 1986 legalization program has become less useful to fulfilling the labor requirements of crop producers. A combination of factors (e.g., aging and the availability of nonfarm jobs) likely has contributed to the decrease in SAWs' share of agricultural employment.23 The  Seasonal agricultural services (SAS) were defined broadly in IRCA as field work related to planting, cultivating, growing and harvesting of fruits and vegetables of every kind and other perishable commodities. The terms ""SAS,"" ""seasonal farm work,"" ""field work"" and ""crop work"" are used interchangeably in this report. 18  17  Commission on Agricultural Workers, Report of the Commission on Agricultural Workers, p. 75. 19  DOL.

Alternatively, there are a number of reasons why SAWs would remain in farm employment (e.g., limited English-language fluency and little formal education). In light of these competing factors, the Commission on Agricultural Workers concluded that it would be (continued...)   CRS-6 fraction of IRCA-legalized farmworkers fell from 33% in FY1989 to 16% in FY19971998.24 Possibly the leading factor, however, is the substantial increase in the presence of illegal aliens.25 In the first half of the 1990s, unauthorized workers rose from 7% to 37% of the SAS labor force.26 And, their share now stands at 51.5%.27 Moreover, the number of SAS workdays performed by illegal aliens increased dramatically from 57 in FY1989 to 154 in FY1991.28 In addition, of the many newcomers to the sector in FY1994-1995, 70% were employed illegally.29 Illegal aliens, arguably, have been displacing legal workers from jobs in the agricultural industry. Farmworker advocates assert that crop producers prefer illegal employees because they have less bargaining power with regard to wages and working conditions than legal employees. Growers counter that they would rather not employ unauthorized workers because doing so puts them at risk of incurring penalties. They argue that the considerable presence of illegal aliens in the U.S. farm labor force implies a shortage of legal workers.  (...continued) difficult to estimate the attrition rate of SAWs from the fields. The existence of fraud in the SAW program further complicates such a calculation because the stock of SAWs who genuinely were farmworkers is unknown: when the Congress was debating immigration proposals in the mid-1980s, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that there were 300,000-500,000 unauthorized farmworkers, but more than twice the upper-end estimate were legalized under the SAW program; this large discrepancy, as well as additional research, led to the widely held conclusion that fraud was extensive. 24  23  DOL, Findings from the National Agricultural Workers Survey: 1997-1998.

Oliveira, Effland, Runyan and Hamm, Hired Farm Labor in Fruit, Vegetable, and Horticultural Specialty Farms. 25  The Commission on Agricultural Workers determined that the design of the SAW program was, at least in part, responsible for the increase in illegal immigration because if dependents of SAWs did not similarly have their status adjusted, they might have illegally entered the United States to join family members. In addition, the network or kinship recruitment process for SAS work continued to flourish and to facilitate not only job placement, but also migration by assisting in border-crossing and in acquiring fra udulent work authorization documents. These findings led the Commission to conclude that ""the concept of a worker-specific and industry-specific legalization program was fundamentally flawed. It invited fraud, posed difficult definitional problems regarding who should or should not be eligible, and ignored the longstanding priority of U.S. immigration policy favoring the unification of families.""

Grower advocates respond that further mechanization would be difficult to develop for many crops and that, even at higher wages, not many U.S. workers would want to perform physically demanding, seasonal, migratory farm labor under variable climactic conditions. Moreover, employer representatives and some policy analysts maintain that growers cannot raise wages substantially without making the U.S. industry uncompetitive in world markets which, in turn, would reduce farm employment. In response, farmworker supporters note that wages are a small part of the price consumers pay for fresh fruits and vegetables and accordingly, higher wages would result in only a slight rise in retail prices. These remain untested arguments as perishable crop growers have rarely, if ever, had to operate without illegal aliens in their workforces.  A Farm Labor Shortage? At the present time, trends in the farm labor market generally do not suggest the existence of a nationwide shortage of domestically available farmworkers, in part because the government's statistical series cover legal and illegal workers. This overall finding does not preclude the possibility of farm labor shortages in certain areas of the country at various times of the year (i.e., spot labor shortages). Caution should be exercised when reviewing the statistics on farmworkers' employment, unemployment, time worked and wages that follow. The surveys from which the data are derived cover somewhat different groups within the farm labor force (e.g., all hired farmworkers as opposed to those engaged only in crop production or workers employed directly by growers as opposed to those supplied to growers by farm labor contractors), and they have different sample sizes. A household survey such as the Current Population Survey (CPS) could well understate the presence of farmworkers because they are more likely to live in less traditional quarters (e.g., labor camps) and of illegal workers generally because they may be reluctant to respond to government enumerators. And, some of the surveys have individuals as respondents (e.g., the CPS and the DOL's National Agricultural Workers Survey) while others have employers as respondents (e.g., the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service Farm Labor Survey). Surveys that query employers are more likely to pickup unauthorized employment than are surveys that query individuals.  Employment The demand for and supply of labor typically cannot be measured directly. Instead, proxies are used such as the trend in employment. Decreases in an occupation's employment or small gains compared to those recorded for other occupations might signal that labor demand is not approaching a supply constraint.   CRS-8 The employment of hired workers engaged in crop or livestock production (including contract workers) has fluctuated erratically between 1990 and 2000. However, the trend overall has been downward, ranging from -0.8% to -1.8% (see columns 7 and 3, respectively, in Table 1). The employment pattern among crop workers hired directly by growers (i.e., excluding those supplied by farm labor contractors and crew leaders) has regularly risen and then fallen back, but to a higher level. This ratcheting upward of employment produced a 12% gain over the 19902000 period. In contrast, other wage and salary workers have experienced steady and robust job growth since the 1990-1991 recession's end. For the entire period (19902000), wage and salary employment in nonfarm industries advanced by 14%. These divergent employment patterns suggest that hired farmworkers have not shared equally in the nation's longest economic expansion and appear to be inconsistent with the presence of a nationwide farm labor shortage.

Note: Numbers rounded to the nearest thousand. a  Data are from the monthly CPS, a survey of households, as reported by the DOL's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for individuals age 16 or older. Because the CPS was substantially revised, data from 1994 forward are not strictly comparable with data from earlier years.   CRS-9 b  Data are from the monthly CPS as reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ERS for individuals age 15 or older. c  Data are from the Farm Labor Survey, a quarterly survey of farm operators, as reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's NASS. The statistics reflect individuals on employers' payrolls during the survey week in January, April, July, and October. Data for Alaska are not included. 1990-1994 annual averages for all hired farmworkers and 1990-1999 annual averages for agricultural service workers were calculated by CRS. d  In the CPS, an individual's occupation is based on the activity in which he spent the most hours during the survey week. Hired farmworkers are those whose primary job is farmwork and for which they receive wages, as opposed to unpaid family workers or self-employed farmers. Hired farmworkers include individuals engaged in planting, cultivating, and harvesting crops or tending livestock whom growers employ directly or through agricultural service providers (e.g., farm labor contractors and crew leaders), as well as farm managers, supervisors of farmworkers, and nursery and other workers. e  The ERS disaggregates hired farmworkers by the kind of establishment employing them (i.e., establishments primarily engaged in crop production, livestock production or other). As ""other"" includes agricultural service providers, the figures for crop workers are limited to farmworkers whom growers employ directly. f  The NASS farmworkers workers (i.e., managers or secretaries or g  counts as hired farmworkers only those persons paid directly by farmers. Hired include field workers (i.e., those who plant, cultivate and harvest crops), livestock those who tend livestock, milk cows or care for poultry) and supervisory workers (e.g., range foremen) as well as other workers on farmers' payrolls (e.g., bookkeepers, pilots).  Includes contract, custom or other workers supplied to farmers but paid by agricultural service firms (e.g., farm labor contractors or crew leaders).  Farm employment is subject to considerable seasonal variation during the course of a year. Typically, demand for hired farm labor peaks in July when many crops are ready to be harvested. The July employment data from the NASS Farm Labor Survey, like the annualized data from the same survey (see columns 5-7 in Table 1), was very unstable during the 1990-2000 period.30  Unemployment Employment data sketch an incomplete picture of the state of the labor market. At the same time that employment in a given occupation is decreasing or increasing relatively slowly, unemployment in the occupation might be falling. Employers would then be faced with a shrinking supply of untapped labor from which to draw. A falling unemployment rate or level would offer some basis for this possibility. As shown in Table 2, the unemployment rate of hired farmworkers engaged in crop or livestock production (including contract labor) has been and remains quite high. Between 10% and 13% of these workers were without jobs in the 1994-2000 period, or at least twice the average unemployment rate in the nation. There also  30  According to the employment was as 1992 -- 1,417,000; 1,346,000; 1997 --  Farm Labor Survey, hired farmworker and agricultural services follows in July of each year: 1990 -- 1,462,000; 1991 -- 1,486,000; 1993 -- 1,420,000; 1994 -- 1,381,000; 1995 -- 1,414,000; 1996 -- 1,409,000; 1998 -- 1,450,000; 1999 -- 1,474,000; 2000 -- 1,377,000.   CRS-10 does not appear to have been an exodus of unemployed workers from farming since the mid-1990s as the number of hired farmworkers who lack jobs has not clearly trended downward. Other observers have examined the unemployment rates in counties that are heavily dependent on the crop farming industry. The GAO, for example, found that many of these agricultural areas chronically experienced double-digit unemployment rates that were well above those reported for much of the rest of the United States. Even when looking at monthly unemployment rates for these areas in order to take into account the seasonality of farm work, the agency found that the agricultural counties exhibited comparatively high rates of joblessness.31 These kind of findings imply a surplus rather than a shortage of farmworkers.32  Table 2.

Hired farmworkers include individuals engaged in crop or livestock production whom growers employ directly or through agricultural service providers (e.g., farm labor contractors), as well as farm managers, supervisors of farmworkers, and nursery and other workers.  Another perspective on the availability of untapped farm labor comes from the DOL's National Agricultural Worker Survey (NAWS).33 During FY1997-1998, the typical crop worker spent just 47% of the year performing farm jobs. The remainder of the year, these farmworkers either were engaged in nonfarm work (8% of the year)  31 32  GAO, H-2A Agricultural Guestworker Program.  See also: Munoz, Cecilia.

Grower advocates contend that the pattern is a manifestation of working in a seasonal industry. But, during the peak month (June) in 1997, only a small majority of farmworkers (58%) held farm jobs.35  Time Worked Another indicator of supply-demand conditions is the amount of time worked (e.g., hours or days). If employers are faced with a labor shortage, they might be expected to increase the amount of time worked by their employees. The Seasonality of Demand: Hours Versus Employment. Recent data reveal no discernible year-to-year variation in the average number of weekly hours that hired farmworkers are employed in crop or livestock production. According to the NASS Farm Labor Survey (FLS), the average workweek of hired farmworkers ranged narrowly (from 40.0- 40.3 hours) since the mid-1990s. Thus, neither the trend in employment nor in work hours seem to imply the existence of a farm labor shortage. There also is not much variability in demand over the course of a year based on hours worked. In 2000, for example, the average week of hired farmworkers was 38.4 hours in mid-January, 40.4 hours in mid-April, 40.0 hours in mid-July and 41.2 hours in mid-October. The instability of the demand for farm labor within a year (i.e., seasonality) is reflected in employment levels more than in work hours per week. The FLS data show that in 2000, for example, farmers had 685,000 workers on their payrolls in mid-January; 840,000 in mid-April; 1,084,000 in mid-July; and 952,000 in midOctober. The Number of Days Worked. Another measure of time worked available from the FLS is ""expected days of employment"" (i.e., farm operators are asked the number of days they intend to utilize their hired farmworkers over the course of a year). As shown in Table 3, they anticipated a low of 593,000 farmworkers on their payrolls for at least 150 days in 1996 and a high of 665,800 (un)authorized workers in 1999. ""Year-round"" workers accounted for about 70% of hired farmworkers since the mid-1990s.36  34  DOL, Findings from the National Agricultural Workers Survey: 1997-1998.

Note: The NASS Farm Labor Survey counts as hired farmworkers only those persons paid directly by farmers (i.e., contract, custom or other workers paid directly by agricultural service providers are excluded). Hired farmworkers include field workers (i.e., those who plant, cultivate and harvest crops), livestock workers (i.e., those who tend livestock, milk cows or care for poultry) and supervisory workers (e.g., crew leaders or range foremen) as well as other workers on farmers' payrolls (e.g., bookkeepers, secretaries or pilots).  NAWS data show that the number of days crop workers actually were employed on farms has diminished over time. In FY1990-1992, the typical foreign-born crop worker was employed in farming for 196 days; in FY1993-1995, the number of farm workdays fell to 186; and in FY1996-1998, the average number of days spent in crop production dropped still further to 174.37 SAS workdays fell among native-born crop  (...continued) for 90 days or 540 hours in each of 3 years during the 4-year period beginning on the date the alien first obtained employment authorization. In contrast, S. 1161 would require unauthorized workers who want to apply for legal temporary residence to prove that they had performed at least 150 days or 900 hours of farm work, whichever is less, during any 12 consecutive months of the 18-month period ending on July 4, 2001. To adjust status to legal permanent residence, these individuals would have to have been employed on farms for 150 days or 900 hours in each of 4 years during the 6-year period ending in November 2001. While some might wish to use the above-described data to roughly estimate the number of unauthorized farmworkers who would be eligible to adjust status, they describe the expectations of farmers and they do not distinguish between legal and illegal workers. In addition, the data could produce an underestimate because they omit the more than 200,000 contract workers on the payrolls of agricultural service providers. Alternatively, the data could produce an overestimate because they include employees not normally thought of as farmworkers (e.g., bookkeepers, secretaries or pilots). 37  36  Calculated by CRS from data reported in DOL, Findings from the National Agricultural (continued...)   CRS-13 workers, as well, from 165 to158. Thus, the trend in days worked -- in addition to the previously discussed trends in employment and in hours worked -- appear to suggest that a nationwide farm labor shortage is not at hand.  Wages Economic theory suggests that if the demand for labor is nearing or has outstripped the supply of labor, firms will in the short-run bid up wages to compete for workers. As a result, earnings in the short-supply field would be expected to increase more rapidly than earnings across all industries or occupations. The ratio of, in this instance, farm to nonfarm wages also would be expected to rise if the former's labor supply were especially constrained. The average hourly earnings of field workers (excluding contract workers) rose to a greater extent than those of other employees in the private sector between 1990 and 2000, at 43.4% and 37.4%, respectively (see Table 4). Nonetheless, field workers' pay hardly increased as a share of other workers' pay: at $7.50 per hour in 2000, field workers still earned a little more than 50 cents for every dollar earned by other private-sector workers. NAWS data reveal a different trend in wages. The survey also produces lower wage estimates than those from the FLS. (See Table 4 and Table 5.) These disparities likely are related to differences between the two surveys. Although the populations covered by the NAWS and the FLS are similar, the NAWS' wage figures include contract labor while those from the FLS do not. As workers supplied to growers by farm labor contractors generally are paid less than direct-hires, this difference could have contributed to the lower hourly earnings of the NAWS. In addition, the NAWS questions workers; the FLS, employers. Figures supplied by employers usually are thought to be more accurate than those recalled by workers. And, while both surveys are designed to reflect seasonal variations during the course of a year, they do not cover identical reference periods.  (...continued) Workers Survey: 1997-1998. Note: The dwindling number of farm workdays over time suggests that illegal alien crop workers could find it increasingly difficult to meet the requirement for adjustment to permanent resident status of performing farm work for 90 days or 540 hours in each of 3 out of 4 years (H.R. 2736/S. 1313) or 150 days or 900 hours in each of 4 out of 6 years.  37   CRS-14  Table 4.

Between 1990 and 1998, the average hourly earnings of crop workers rose to a lesser extent based on the NAWS (18.2%) than on the FLS (33.3%). Crop workers' wages, according to the NAWS, rose to a lesser extent in the 1990-1998 period than those of other workers in the private sector (18.2% and 27.7%, respectively) -- just the opposite of the relationship between the FLS and BLS data (33.3% and 27.7%, respectively). As a result of the relatively lower wage estimates and the relatively slow wage growth derived from the NAWS, the typical crop worker was estimated to have dropped below 50 cents for every dollar paid to other privatesector workers since the late 1990s.   CRS-15  Table 5.

Note: Crop workers include field packers, supervisors and other field workers who engage in such activities as planting, tending and harvesting crops. Initially, the survey included only field workers on perishable crop farms to comply with IRCA: NAWS was developed to enable the DOL to calculate changes in the supply of SAS labor, which was then used in the shortage calculation conducted by the U.S. Departments of Labor and Agriculture for triggering the RAW program. In the mid-1990s, the survey was expanded to include field workers in non-perishable crops (e.g., silage or other crops intended solely for animal fodder). The data relate to the farm earnings of field workers age 14 or older, regardless of method of payment (i.e., those paid an hourly rate, by the piece or a combination of the two). The sample includes direct-hires and contract labor. The survey is conducted at different times over the course of a year to capture seasonal variations.  Conclusion In summary, indicators of supply-demand conditions generally are inconsistent with the existence of a nationwide shortage of domestically available farmworkers in part because the measures include both legal and illegal employment. This finding does not preclude the possibility of farmworker shortages in certain parts of the country at various times during the year. The analysis does not address the adequacy of legal workers in the seasonal farm labor supply relative to grower demand.   CRS-16 Whether there would be an adequate supply of legal U.S. farmworkers if new technologies were developed or different labor-management practices were implemented continues to be an unanswered question. Whether more U.S. workers would be willing to become farmworkers if wages were raised and whether the size of the increase would make the industry uncompetitive in the world marketplace also remain open issues. These matters remain unresolved because perishable crop growers have rarely, if ever, had to operate without illegal aliens being present in the domestic farm workforce.38  In the conference report for the Labor Department's FY2000 appropriation (H.Rept. 106479), the Congress charged the DOL with reporting on ways to promote a legal domestic workforce in the agricultural sector and on options for such things as improving farmworker compensation, developing a more stable farm workforce, and enhancing farmworkers' living conditions. The report (U.S. Department of Labor Report to Congress: The Agricultural Labor Market -- Status and Recommendations), issued in December 2000, recommends that the federal minimum wage be raised, agency funding for labor law enforcement increased, congressional appropriations for AgWork (i.e., an internet-based, on-line job matching system specifically for agricultural employees and employers) continued, growers' greater use of automated employee verification systems encouraged, H-2A program streamlining further pursued while maintaining protections for U.S. and foreign farmworkers and discussions held with countries from which farmworkers come to ""explore ways in which their legal rights can be better protected."" The Department concluded that IRCA's farm legalization program failed to turn an illegal into a legal workforce. It asserted that congressional proposals to ease growers' access to temporary farmworkers outside the existing H-2A program ""would not create a legal domestic agricultural workforce"" and instead ""would lower wages and working a nd living conditions in agricultural jobs resulting in fewer domestic workers continuing employment in agriculture and perpetuating the industry's dependence on a foreign labor force."" The DOL pointed out that another approach to creating a legal supply of crop workers has never been tried -- increasing wages and improving working conditions ""by normalizing legal protections for farm workers and increasing mechanization,"" which has the potential to attract more U.S. workers to agriculture and raise the productivity of a possibly smaller farm labor force. In recognition that there might be short-run increases in farm labor costs were its recommendations implemented, the Department urged the Congress to consider ways to temporarily assist crop growers.  38"

One-Step Agreement December 18, 2003  Page 4  PROPOSED ACTION: Staff recommends that the Panel approve this Agreement if funding is available and the project meets the Panel priorities.  NARRATIVE: Hilmar Cheese Company, Inc. (Hilmar Cheese), located in Hilmar, California, was founded by a group of dairymen in 1984. Hilmar Cheese manufactures a variety of cheese and whey products that are sold nationally to retail dealers under the retailer's name or sold to consumers through on-line orders and at the visitor center under the Hilmar Cheese name. According to the Contractor, Internet technology and direct sales allows competition from other states as well as Ireland, England, and Australia. The competitors manufacture cheese products at reduced costs and can meet or under bid the Contractor. Hilmar Cheese employees participated in a skills assessment and a curriculum was developed based on the results. The company will focus on training that involves technologically advanced equipment and team based environments. Hilmar Cheese has invested time and money in efforts to regain and expand its market share. Investments include $800,000 in new equipment, a Just-in-Time (JIT) order system and a fully integrated accounting, payroll, personnel, and training program. The JIT program will allow Hilmar Cheese to order, manufacture, and ship all products with the ability to track finished goods. New dryers, tanks, milk receiving, and fillers will allow for a technically advanced manufacturing facility and employees who are able to operate in a competitive environment. The new computer software will provide the resources to operate this facility at optimal performance. The proposed training is for administrative staff, team leaders, production workers, and lift truck drivers. The following topics are included in the training plan: Continuous Improvement will give employees the skills to problem-solve, develop teams, manage conflicts; increase production and work flow; quality concepts; decision-making; time management; personnel conflict resolutions; and Just-In-Time (JIT) processes. Manufacturing Principles will train employees to competently operate and troubleshoot technical equipment, to scan, and to track inventory for control as well as quality issues. Computer Skills will equip employees with skills to use the new payroll, accounting, personnel, and training software. Employees must have these skills to effectively utilize the new software program to achieve proper inventory control, tracking orders, scheduling, and integrated material management. Without this skills training employees could not efficiently use the new system. Supplemental Nature of Training Panel Legislation requires that ETP funds be used to supplement, rather than displace, funds available through existing programs conducted by employers and government-funded programs.

The company's investment of $800,000 in new technology requires that training be given to the employees who will work with this equipment and software. ETP funding will allow the training to be in-depth and in a classroom setting. The training in this proposed Agreement will be followed by on-the-job training paid for by the employer as well as refresher training and ongoing employer-funded training. A prior ETP Agreement included hazardous material handling and computer skills training for engineers, mechanics, and computer technicians. These past trainees are not included in this training proposal. Training in High Unemployment Areas Unemployment Insurance Code, Section 10201.5, states that the Panel may waive wage requirements for trainees located in high unemployment areas of California.

Then it describes the data used in the analysis, assumptions about the elasticity of labor demand and supply, and estimates of welfare recipients in the labor force.      I. Economic Model      The economic model presented here provides a framework for studying the entry of large numbers of welfare recipients into the low-skill labor market as a result of (1) the pull of the economy, and (2) the push of welfare reform.   The  pull  of the economy refers to an increase in the labor demanded by firms at any given wage level, and the entry of welfare recipients into the low-skill labor market in response to better job opportunities. These welfare recipients would have entered the labor force even in the absence of welfare reform. The  push  of welfare reform refers to an increase in the number of persons willing to work at any given wage level as a direct result of welfare reform, and the consequent entry of welfare recipients into the labor market. These welfare recipients would not have entered the labor force in the absence of welfare reform.   The discussion of the model in the next section is divided into four subsections.  Subsection A  discusses the economic model.  Subsection B  stresses the importance of elasticities on the effect of welfare reform.  Subsection C  discusses unemployment.  Subsection D  discusses the effect of downward wage rigidities on unemployment.    A. Assessment of the Impact of Welfare Reform and Economic Expansion    The pull of the economy is modeled as a “demand shift” — an increase in the demand for low-skill labor at any wage level (i.e., an outward shift in the demand curve). The push of welfare reform is modeled as a “supply shift” — an increase in the supply of low-skill labor at any wage level (i.e., an outward shift in the supply curve). Both shifts are positive, i.e., they involve an increase in demand and an increase in supply at every wage.   The shifts can be illustrated on a standard labor demand/labor supply diagram ( Exhibit 4.1 ). LS 0  is the labor supply curve before welfare reform, and LS 1  is the labor supply curve after welfare reform. LD 0  is the labor demand curve before economic expansion, and LD 1  is the labor demand curve after economic expansion.   The demand shift from LD 0  to LD 1  and the movement along LS 0  from Point A to Point B represent the pull of the economy. It is important to note that the pull of the economy does not shift the supply curve. Employment increases from E 0  to E B . The number of welfare recipients pulled into employment is less than this amount, because some who are pulled into employment by the expansion are not welfare recipients.    Exhibit 4.1  Demand and Supply for Low-Skill Labor          Symmetrically, the supply curve shift from LS 0  to LS 1  and the movement along LD 1  from Point B to Point C represents the push of welfare reform. As a result, employment increases from E B  to E 1 . As drawn, the new equilibrium is at a lower wage than the initial equilibrium — the upward pressure of economic expansion on wages is more than offset by the downward pressure of welfare reform. Under such a scenario, some individuals who are working in the initial equilibrium will not be willing to work in the new equilibrium, because of the lower wage. These workers are “displaced” by welfare reform. In the diagram, they are represented by the horizontal distance from E V  to E 0 . The number of new workers is represented by the distance from E V  to E 1 , and is exactly equal to the size of the shift in the supply curve.   It is important to keep in mind that the supply curve represents the supply of workers from two populations — adults who are in the group targeted by welfare programs and all other low-skill, working-age adults. Thus, the increased employment due to the pull of the economy that is represented in  Exhibit 4.1  exceeds the number of welfare recipients who are drawn into employment by the economic expansion. Similarly, the workers displaced by welfare reform in  Exhibit 4.1  might include some who are in the target group for welfare programs, and some of these might even enter welfare as a result. (32)    Points A and C represent initial and final equilibrium outcomes, before and after welfare reform (supply shift) and economic expansion (demand shift). The percentage changes in employment and wages between these two points can be expressed formally by the following equations, which show the effects of the demand and supply shifts on wages and employment. (33)    (i)  % D employment = ( e s  * % D demand + e d  * % D supply) / ( e d  + e s )    (ii)  % D wage = (% D demand - % D supply) / ( e d  + e s )    where:           e d  is the absolute value of the elasticity of     demand — the absolute value of the percentage change in employment     associated with a one percent increase in the wage rate along the demand     curve (the value is positive);         e s  is the elasticity of supply — the percentage change     in employment associated with a one percent increase in the wage rate along     the supply curve (the value is positive);         % D wage is the percentage change in the equilibrium wage;         % D employment is the percentage change in equilibrium employment;         % D demand is the percentage change in labor demanded at a given wage level     (i.e., the size of the horizontal shift of the demand curve, expressed in     percent); and         % D supply is the percentage change in labor supplied at a given wage level     (i.e., the size of the horizontal shift of the supply curve, expressed in     percent).     We observe the initial (pre-reform) equilibrium point (Point A) and final (post-reform) equilibrium point (Point C) in the data collected (discussed in Section II.A below). These data give us the following information.           Employment at Point A;         Wages at Point A;         Employment at Point C; and         Wages at Point C     This information can be used along with information about the shapes of the supply and demand curves to obtain Point B in  Exhibit 4.1 . Point B is the wage and employment combination that would have been attained as a result of the economic expansion in the absence of welfare reform. The wage and employment information described above defines Points A and C (equilibrium outcomes before and after welfare reform).   Using the elasticity assumptions (that is, the value of the percentage change in employment associated with the percentage change in wages), we can draw labor demand and labor supply curves that pass through Points A and C. The intersection of the demand curve passing through Point C (LD 1 ) and the supply curve passing through Point A (LS 0 ) is Point B. Points A and C, along with the elasticity assumptions, are sufficient to produce the entire figure. We can also use this information to calculate other information of interest (e.g., the size of the shifts in the demand and supply curves, and the number of displaced workers).   The only remaining unknowns in the equations (i) and (ii) are the magnitudes of the demand and supply shifts ( % D demand  and  % D supply ). Because we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve these two equations for  % D demand  and  % D supply  (see below). We can then use the equations to estimate the effects of the demand and supply shifts independently; that is, we can produce counterfactuals for the impact of economic expansion on employment and wages in the low-skill market, as well as counterfactuals for the impact of welfare reform on the same outcomes.   Solving equations (i) and (ii) for  % D demand  and  % D supply , we get the magnitudes of the demand and supply shifts (equations (iii) and (iv)).    (iii) % D demand = % D employment + e d  * % D wage     (iv) % D supply = % D employment - e s  * % D wage     Equations (i) through (iv) apply to small shifts in the supply and demand curves, but provide reasonable approximations for larger shifts if the elasticities of supply and demand are reasonably constant; they are exact if elasticities are constant. Constant elasticity functions are often used to represent supply and demand curves in the applied economics literature. We make use of elasticity estimates from the literature and the above relationships in our analysis.   The wage and employment equations can be used to analyze the impact of the supply shift alone (let  % D demand  be zero), or the demand shift alone (let  % D supply  be zero); that is, given the shift to the demand curve or the supply curve, and given the elasticities, we can use the equations to predict the impact on employment and wages. The percentage of workers displaced by an increase in supply can be derived from (iv).    (v) % displacement = % D supply - % D employment = - e s  * % D wage      B. Elasticity of Labor Demand and Labor Supply    The magnitude of the effect of welfare reform on wages and employment is highly dependent on the elasticity of labor demand and labor supply. The effect of the elasticity of labor demand and labor supply on the percentage change in wages and employment can be obtained by differentiating equations (i) and (ii) with respect to the elasticities. Results are summarized in  Exhibit 4.2 .

The  direction  of the percentage change in the wage is determined by the relative magnitudes of the supply and demand shifts; elasticities only affect the  magnitude  of the percentage change in the wage. If the labor demand and supply curves are more responsive to the wage (i.e., more elastic), then only a small change in the wage will be needed to restore the labor market to equilibrium. For example, consider the response of the economy if there is a positive demand shift. More workers will be demanded. Wages will rise. If the labor supply curve is very elastic, just a small increase in the wage will be sufficient to draw enough new workers into the labor market to satisfy the increased demand. Alternatively, consider the response of the economy if there is a positive supply shift. Wages will fall. If the labor demand curve is elastic, a small decrease in the wage will be sufficient to increase the quantity of labor demanded to absorb the increased supply. In either case, the equilibrium will be restored with a small change in the wage. Regardless of the relative magnitude of the demand and supply shifts, a higher elasticity of demand and/or supply will result in a smaller absolute change in the wage.   In equation (i) (the  % D employment  equation), if the demand shift is greater than the supply shift  (% D demand > % D supply ), then a higher elasticity of demand will result in a lower percentage change in employment, while a higher elasticity of supply will have the opposite effect. If the supply shift is greater than the demand shift ( % D supply > % D demand ), the results are reversed: the higher the elasticity of demand, the higher the percentage change in employment, and the higher the elasticity of supply, then the lower the percentage change in employment.    C. Unemployment Rate    One purpose of this project is to assess the impact of welfare reform on the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), is an estimate of the percentage of persons who want to work who are not employed. Hence, it is intended to capture “involuntary” unemployment and does not include those who do not want to work (i.e., who are voluntarily unemployed).   In the conceptual model we have presented thus far, there is no involuntary unemployment, by definition. When shifts to the demand or supply curves occur, wages adjust so that everyone who is willing to work at the prevailing wage is employed. While there are some who might be willing to work only at a higher wage, they are voluntarily unemployed.   As discussed above, the influx of workers into the labor market as a result of welfare reform will lead to the displacement of existing workers unless the expansion of demand is sufficient to completely offset the negative effect of the supply shift on wages. Displacement occurs because workers who were employed before welfare reform lose their jobs to welfare recipients who are willing to work for a lower wage. From a theoretical standpoint, displaced workers might be voluntarily unemployed, because they are not willing to work at the lower wage that now prevails in the labor market. However, from a practical standpoint, BLS defines displaced workers as unemployed as long as they are looking for work. If displaced workers eventually decide that they cannot get a job at a wage they would be willing to accept, they might drop out of the labor force and no longer be counted as involuntarily unemployed by BLS.   We assume that job displacement does increase the unemployment rate in the short-run, as displaced workers are not perfectly aware that the prevailing wage in the labor market has fallen. Displaced workers are replaced by welfare recipients who are willing to work for a lower wage. We assume displacement is the primary means through which welfare reform leads to unemployment in the low-skill labor market.   An inability of wages to adjust to new conditions in the long run would, however, result in long-term unemployment. One reason why this might occur is downward wage rigidity, an issue that we turn to next.    D. Downward Wage Rigidity    The above discussion assumes that the responsiveness of wage adjustments to shifts in either curve are symmetric: in percentage terms, the effects of a positive shift in a curve on wages and employment are equal, but opposite in sign, to the effects of a negative shift of the same size. Economists have long argued, however, that institutional factors, such as the minimum wage and union contracts, result in asymmetric responses to demand shifts. More specifically, a downward shift in demand, induced by a recession or some other factor, might have very little negative impact on wages, but result in large reductions in employment, while an outward shift in demand of equivalent size, starting from the same point, results in higher wages and small increases in employment.   This phenomenon is very relevant for our analysis because many low-skill workers receive wages that are close to the minimum wage and because the starting point of our analysis, 1993, is near the beginning of a recovery from a major recession. If unemployment in an area in 1993 is still high relative to historical values, then the number of low-skill workers who are willing to work at current wage rates might be substantially higher than the number who are employed, and outward demand shifts are likely to increase employment, with little effect on wages, while outward supply shifts might simply result in greater unemployment, with little effect on employment or wages.   This is illustrated in  Exhibit 4.3 , in a stylized fashion. The initial supply curve is “kinked;” it is horizontal at wage level W 0 , to the left of Point B, then follows the upward sloping LS 0 . W 0  represents a “peak” wage from the most recent expansionary period. The demand curve that generated that wage rate (i.e., pre-recession peak demand) is represented by LD -1 , and peak employment is E -1 . The initial demand curve LD 0  passes through the horizontal portion of the initial supply curve at E 0  (Point A).    Exhibit 4.3  Demand and Supply for Low-Skill Labor in the Presence of Downward Wage Rigidity        Consider first an outward shift in demand (LD 1 ), holding supply constant. The wage remains constant until the demand curve shifts past the previous peak demand curve at Point B, then rises along LS 0  to Point C, where LD 1  intersects LS 0 . This scenario can be used to illustrate what happens if we ignore the kinked supply curve in the analysis. Suppose we, mistakenly, assume that the initial supply curve is LS* — which also passes through LD 0  at Point A, but is not kinked. The employment and wage change generated by the fixed kinked supply curve and the shift in demand is identical to what would be observed if LS* was the initial supply curve and supply shifted from LS* to LS 0  as demand shifted from LD 0  to LD 1  (Point C). Thus, if we ignored the kinked nature of the hypothetical true supply curve, we could easily mistake an increase in employment and wages that is due solely to a demand shift as the result of both a shift in demand and a smaller shift in supply. The size of the false supply shift is the horizontal distance from Point A to Point B. In this stylized model, this is identical to the drop in employment from peak pre-recession employment, E -1 , to E 0 . While the increase in employment from E 0  to E 1  is entirely due to the demand shift, the analysis would attribute part of the change to the false supply shift — represented by the distance between E 1  and E*.   Next, consider an outward shift in supply, to LS 1 , holding demand constant, again starting at Point A. As the wage rate is already at the pre-expansion peak, it cannot decline further. There is no increase in employment, because demand does not shift. The number of persons seeking jobs at the existing wage rate is E 3  (Point D), and E 3  – E 1  workers are unemployed. Hence, under this stylized scenario, the push of welfare reform would just increase unemployment without increasing employment or depressing wages. This scenario further illustrates what happens if the analysis were to ignore the kinked supply curve. It would appear that the shift in supply due to welfare push was the horizontal distance from LS* to LS 1 , greater than the horizontal distance which represents the actual shift, from LS 0  to LS 1 , again by amount E -1  – E 0 .   The analysis becomes more complex if there is both a demand and a supply shift, because the order in which they shift matters. If supply shifts first, to LS 1 , then demand shifts to LD 1 , the wage rate stays constant and employment expands to E 2 ; E 3  – E 2  workers are unemployed. If, instead, demand shift firsts, then supply, wages increase to W1, employment increases to E1, and the shift in supply has no impact on wages or employment, but results in unemployment of E 4  – E 1 .   In a less stylized version of the above example, the supply curve would be more elastic at wage rates below previous peaks, and less elastic at higher wage rates. Such a supply curve would yield findings that are qualitatively similar to the stylized version presented above, with outward shifts in supply generating only modest wage reductions and outward shifts in demand generating only modest increases up to the point where demand passes the previous peak, and more pronounced increases thereafter.   In the decomposition of employment and wage changes into changes due to welfare push and changes due to the economy, we do not attempt to model kinks in the supply curve like those that appear in this stylized example, because we do not have a sound empirical basis for differentiating between the supply elasticity for low-skill workers during the early recovery from a recession and the elasticity as economic expansion passes the earlier peak. Instead, we use a constant elasticity model with an elasticity based on findings in the literature. The analysis of the kinked supply curve, above, is very important, however, in helping us interpret the findings.    E. Summary    The economic model presented here provides a framework for analyzing the entry of large numbers of welfare recipients into the low-skill labor market. Better job opportunities and welfare reform are the two main reasons for this phenomenon.   The economic model is an equilibrium model of low-skill labor demand and labor supply. In the economic model, a shift in labor demand represents the increase in job opportunities and a shift in labor supply represents the increase in labor market entry of welfare recipients due to work requirements and time limits. Both of these changes increase employment, but have opposite impacts on prevailing wages.   If the equilibrium wage falls, some former workers will be displaced; i.e., their employers will replace them with welfare recipients who have entered the labor market and are willing to work for lower wages. This is likely to result in short-term unemployment, as those displaced continue to seek work at a higher wage. In the long-term some of these individuals are likely to become discouraged and leave the labor force, mitigating the impact on the unemployment rate.      II. Calculating Low-Skill Employment and Wages      To calculate low-skill employment and wages, we calculated employment and wages by occupation. We first classified occupations as low-skill, medium-skill, and high-skill, and then aggregated employment and wages across all occupations that were classified as low-skill.    A. Calculating Employment and Wages by Occupation    To estimate employment and wages by occupation, we obtained employment and wage data by industry from the BLS Covered Employment and Wages (ES-202) system. We distributed employment and wages in each industry across occupations using the National Industry Staffing Patterns (NISP).   It would have been preferable to use employment and wage data by occupation instead of by industry, obviating the need for an industry to occupation conversion. The Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, on which the NISP is based, tabulates employment and wage data by occupation. However, wage data are only available for 1998. In addition, the OES did not survey all agricultural, forestry, fishing, and private household industries. Therefore, we used the ES-202 for employment and wages.    1.Covered Employment and Wages (ES-202)    The ES-202 program provides comprehensive employment and wage information by industry for workers covered by state Unemployment Insurance laws and federal workers covered by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program. Employment is reported monthly for covered workers who were working or who received pay during the pay period including the 12 th  of the month. Wages, from payroll records, are reported quarterly for all covered workers who received pay during the quarter.   The ES-202 data are coded according to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, which classifies establishments by industry activity. While a four-digit SIC level is assigned to all reporting establishments, employment and wages are often aggregated to the two-digit or one-digit level. Examples of industries in these categories include the following:                   Four-Digit                   Two-Digit                   One-Digit                                   Wheat Grains                   Agricultural Production Crops                   Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing                                   Creamery Butter                   Food and Kindred Products                   Manufacturing                                   Women’s Clothing                   Stores Apparel & Accessory Stores                   Retail Trade                                   Junior Colleges                   Educational Services                   Services               Because of confidentiality concerns, ES-202 data are not disclosed for any level in which the universe has three or fewer employers or is dominated by a single employer that represents more than 80 percent of employment. We obtained ES-202 data at the two-digit SIC level rather than four-digit SIC to reduce the number of undisclosed employment records. (34)  When we encountered undisclosed cells at the two-digit SIC level, we allocated the remaining employment and payroll at the one-digit SIC level (total minus all disclosed employment within an industry level) equally across all undisclosed cells.    2.National Industry Staffing Patterns (NISP)    For this study, we use the NISP’s occupational estimates by industry, which are produced from the national OES, to convert employment and payroll (total wages) by industry for each region to employment and payroll by occupation. Prior to 1996, the OES surveyed only one-third of the industries in the sample each year, taking three years to fully complete the survey. This was done to reduce respondent burden. In addition, it only collected employment data. In 1996, OES began to survey all industries in each year, but recommended using three years of data to reduce sampling error. As discussed above, it began collecting wage information in 1996.   We obtained the NISP at the two-digit level from BLS for 1990 through 1998. We combined 1990 to 1992, 1993 to 1995, and 1996 to 1998 NISPs to obtain the industry occupation matrix for 1993, 1996, and 1998. Because NISP is only produced at the national level, we made the implicit assumption that there were no significant regional differences in the occupational distribution for each industry. We tested this assumption using the Current Population Survey (CPS), and found a consistent pattern of occupational employment in each industry across four regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, West) and in urban versus rural areas. These results are presented in  Appendix A.    The 1998 NISP was used to distribute payroll for 1993, 1996, and 1998. We assumed there were no significant differences in the occupational distribution within an industry over time. We tested this assumption using the CPS. The CPS shows a declining percentage of payroll in low-skill occupations over time, while we assumed no decline in the proportion of total payroll allocated to low-skill occupations (see  Appendix B ). We are not too concerned about the latter assumption because there is no decline in the share of employment in low-skill occupations from the CPS, while there is an increase over time from the NISP (i.e., we found employment in low-skill occupations grew at a faster rate than employment in high-skill occupations). Thus, in both cases, wages per low-skill worker grew at a slower rate than wages per high-skill worker.    B. Classifying Occupations by Education and Training Requirements    We classified occupations into three skill categories (low, medium, and high) using the BLS education and training requirements for occupation groups. The BLS requirements are straightforward and consistent with the CPS and OES. BLS classifies occupations in 11 groups according to their education and training requirements. We grouped occupations that require short-term (less than one month) on-the-job training as low-skill. This is the occupation category that requires the least level of education and training in the BLS classification. Examples of occupations in the low-skill category are retail salespersons, office clerks, cashiers, truck drivers, personal care and home health aides. We grouped occupations that require more than short-term on-the-job training, but less than a bachelor’s degree, as medium-skill. These occupations may require more on-the-job training, more work experience, vocational training, or an associate’s degree. We grouped occupations that require a bachelor’s degree or higher as high-skill.   One disadvantage of the BLS classification is that it does not indicate whether occupations require a high school degree. This should not be a problem, however, as CPS tabulations show that there is a mix of high school graduates and high school drop-outs in the population who received income from TANF in 1998 (see  Exhibit 2.1 ).   Other researchers (Leete and Bania (35) ; Lerman, Loprest, and Ratcliffe (36) ) have defined low-skill jobs to include both short-term and moderate-term training occupations. Leete and Bania also included long-term training occupations in their definition, but limited the percentage of welfare recipients who were eligible for these jobs. We chose to include only short-term training occupations in our definition because we believed these occupations would be affected most by welfare reform.   As discussed above, we assumed there were no regional differences between the occupational distribution of employment within an industry (i.e., differences in skill level resulted from differences in the industry mix of employment across regions).  Appendix C  presents a comparison of the percentage of 1998 employment by skill level from our estimates (ES-202 merged with the NISP) and the OES, which we were able to obtain for selected regions only. The percentage of employment that was low-skill was slightly lower from the ES-202/NISP than from OES.      III. Assumptions of Elasticity of Labor Demand and Labor   Supply      Our assumption is that welfare reform will have the largest effect on the low-skill labor market. Hence, the relevant elasticities of labor demand and labor supply are those for low-skill labor. Bartik presents a summary of elasticity estimates used in studies that examine the effect of welfare reform on wages and displacement. (37)  The three studies cited in the exhibit (Mishel and Schmitt, (38)  Holzer, (39)  and Bernstein (40) )used a labor demand elasticity of -0.3. Holzer and Bernstein used a labor supply elasticity of 0.4; Mishel and Schmitt used a labor supply elasticity of zero. All three studies repeated their calculations for alternative labor demand and labor supply elasticity assumptions.   Because elasticities for different types of labor can vary, it is necessary to use an elasticity estimate for workers who are similar in characteristics to welfare recipients. The labor demand estimates used in the studies cited above are taken from the minimum wage literature. The labor supply estimates used in these studies are taken from the literature on the decline in employment among low-skill adult males in the 1980s.   Based on these studies, we used a labor demand elasticity of -0.3 and a labor supply elasticity of 0.4. We were not able to find any studies that compared the differences in the elasticities across rural and urban areas. We were also not able to find any studies that compared the differences in the elasticity of labor supply before and after welfare reform.   Assumptions about the elasticity of labor supply and labor demand are critical to our analysis. As was discussed in Section 4.A and will be discussed in more detail in  Chapter 5 , the elasticity assumptions are instrumental in determining the size of the demand and supply shifts from the employment and wage data that we collected. Therefore, we used alternative labor demand and labor supply elasticities to test the sensitivity of our results to the elasticity assumptions. These results are presented in  Appendix D . We found that our basic findings are not affected much by reasonable changes in the elasticities as a result of the small size of the increase in employment due to welfare reform relative to the low-skill labor market.      IV. Estimating Welfare Recipients in Labor Force      To estimate the number of welfare recipients in the labor force, we collected caseload information from all regions and estimated labor force participation from a combination of caseload employment reports, state estimates produced by DHHS, and a study of TANF leavers from the National Survey of America’s Families (NSAF).   The change in welfare caseloads over time is due to two effects: the change in the number of welfare recipients who enter the welfare rolls (inflow) and the change in the number of welfare recipients who leave the rolls (outflow).    Change in Inflow     Changes in inflow can be caused by the economy and by welfare reform. For example, potential welfare recipients who might have entered the rolls under previous economic conditions (e.g., the 1991 recession) may be less likely to apply if they can find jobs easily in a strong economy. Potential welfare recipients might also be diverted from welfare due to welfare reforms, such as time limits, stringent work requirements, and state welfare diversion programs that either require an applicant to look for work before being approved for benefits or offer a one-time lump sum payment to help potential clients to avoid welfare altogether. These potential recipients might instead rely on family support for income or enter the labor market.    Change in Outflow     Changes in outflow also are due to the economy and welfare reform. For example, in a strong economy, more recipients might leave welfare due to better job opportunities in the labor market. Welfare reform policies also play a role.   More recipients might leave welfare due to time limits and stringent work requirements. Recipients who leave may rely on family support for income or might enter the labor market. Some might have been working “off the books” while on welfare and could continue to rely on their shadow labor market activities for income after they leave the rolls.   For this analysis, we are measuring the change in  stock  between two points in time and not focusing on changes in  flows . Therefore, our analysis assumes there is no net effect on the labor market when a person leaves welfare, but is replaced by another person who enters welfare.   Our analysis uses the number of welfare recipients who are  newly  employed. That is, our estimates include those who were not in the labor force initially (e.g., in a given month in 1993), but who entered at a later point in time (e.g., in a given month in 1996). The number of welfare recipients entering the labor market is estimated using the following equation:   (vi) (C 0  – C 1 ) *(L 1  – W 0 ) + C 1  * (W 1  – W 0 )   where:   C 0  = Caseload at time(0)  C 1  = Caseload at time(1)  W 0  = Percent of caseload in labor force at time(0)  W 1  = Percent of caseload in labor force at time(1)  L 1  = Percent of leavers in labor force at time(1)   Note that C 0  – C 1  represents the change as a result of welfare recipients leaving (net of those arriving) and others diverted from entering the rolls. While the formula appears to assume that welfare leavers and welfare stayers — those who continued to be on the rolls at time(1) — had equal labor force participation rates at time(0), this is not a necessary condition. We can assume that welfare leavers had a higher rate of labor force participation in the initial period than did stayers and still get the same results. (41)     Exhibit 4.4  presents each region’s monthly caseload, for each relevant year, along with estimates of the percentage of welfare recipients and welfare leavers who were in the labor force. These estimates came from the following sources:           The state welfare agencies supplied the average monthly caseload estimates     for the specific study regions.         A few of the state welfare agencies (Alabama, Missouri, New York, and Wisconsin)     were able to estimate the percent of the caseload employed in the study regions.     For Mississippi, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Vermont regions,     we used the state average, reported by DHHS.         The Urban Institute analyzed the NSAF, which surveyed families between February     and November 1997. Approximately 61 percent of the families that had been     on welfare at some point since 1995 and had left and remained off welfare     at the survey date were     employed. (42)  Similar rates were     found in the studies of welfare leavers funded by ASPE.         We estimated that a smaller percent of leavers (50 percent) were employed     between 1993 and 1996. We know of no study that has estimated this percentage     for this pre-PRWORA time period.     As this exhibit shows, New York, Vermont, and Wisconsin welfare recipients were more likely to be in the labor force while on welfare. These states offer relatively high cash grants that enable individuals with earnings to remain eligible for welfare. The Southern states, on the other hand, offer lower grants and have a lower share of the welfare population employed.

Endnotes       (32)  Technically, there are two supply curves behind the supply curve drawn, one for each of the population groups. The sum of labor supplied at a given wage from the two groups corresponds to total labor supplied at that wage on the supply curve shown. The shift in the labor supply curve for the welfare target group corresponds to the shift in the total labor supply curve. [Back To  Text ]    (33)  The derivation of these equations can be found in Freeman (1977). They hold only approximately, except for infinitesimally small shifts. A simple way to derive them is to begin with the assumption that the demand and supply curves are linear in natural logarithms (i.e., assume that the wage and employment axes in Exhibit 4.1 are natural log scales). For small changes, changes in logs are equivalent to percentage changes in levels. The slope of the supply curve on the log scales is the inverse of the supply elasticity and the slope of the demand curve is the negative of the inverse of the demand elasticity. Given these slopes, Equations (i) and (ii) can be derived via the use of geometry. If percentage changes in the equation are replaced by changes in logarithms, and if the demand and supply curves are linear in the logarithms, the equations apply exactly.

The following identity also holds:   (viii) ( C 0  – C 1 ) * W L0  + C 1  * W S0  = W 0  * C 0  {total employed at time(0)}   Substituting the right-hand side of Eq. (viii) in Eq.

GX003-68-13229810	How Well Have Rural and Small Metropolitan Labor Markets    Absorbed Welfare Recipients?        Executive Summary      [  Main Page of Report  |  Contents of Report  ]       Contents               Study Regions           Basic Findings on Employment and Wages           Approach to Measuring the Impact of Welfare Reform on     Labor Markets           Effect of Shift in Demand and Shift in Supply on Employment     and Wages           Effect of Welfare Reform on Employment and Wages           Projecting the Effect of a Recession           Summary and Implications for Further Research      Since 1993, welfare recipients have been leaving the welfare rolls for work in record numbers. From January 1993 to January 1998, welfare caseloads declined by 33 percent nationally, and several studies have estimated that over half of the adults who have left welfare have entered the labor market. (1)  The inflow of welfare recipients into the labor market can be attributed to two basic factors: welfare reform and the strong economy. Welfare reform is widely perceived to have begun with the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) in mid-1996, which increased the number of welfare recipients who were required to seek work. But even prior to this legislation, many states were reshaping their Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) programs under waivers, which likely increased the number of welfare recipients entering the labor force in at least some of these states. In addition, the strong economy from 1993 to 1998 increased the availability of low-skill jobs and undoubtedly lured many welfare recipients into the low-skill labor market.   Several other factors may have contributed to changes in labor market participation of welfare recipients and are worth mentioning. First, the federal government expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for working low-income families in the early- and mid-1990s, which most likely encouraged some welfare recipients to enter the labor force. Second, the minimum wage increased in 1997, which could have offset downward wage pressure from the entry of welfare recipients into the labor force. Third, some regions of the country experienced significant changes in population, which reduced or increased the number of low-skill workers in these areas. Finally, the recession of the early 1990s created a pool of unemployed low-skill workers who were available to take new jobs when the economy began to recover.   Policy-makers have been concerned about whether enough jobs will be available to employ the additional welfare recipients entering the labor market as a result of welfare reform. If a surplus of jobs is not available in particular areas, welfare recipients’ entry into the labor force might reduce low-skill wages and displace some workers. Policy-makers are especially concerned about the impact of welfare reform on rural and small metropolitan labor markets, because these markets might be less able to absorb the inflow of welfare recipients than urban labor markets.   The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) contracted with The Lewin Group to examine how well rural and small metropolitan labor markets can absorb welfare recipients, and to the extent feasible, estimate the impact of welfare reform on rural and small-metropolitan regions since 1993. This study uses an economic model to estimate the impact of welfare reform and improvements in the economy on the low-skill labor market, where most welfare recipients seek work. A major challenge facing researchers in this area is to distinguish between entry due to reforms (“welfare push”) and entry due to the strong economy (“demand pull”). This decomposition is necessary if we are to anticipate future conditions in the low-skill labor market, when the economy might not be so strong. We attempted such a decomposition in this report.      Study Regions      We selected 12 regions for this study, which include a mix of rural and small metropolitan areas (the latter are defined as having fewer than 200,000 residents). The regions vary widely in population characteristics and labor market conditions and implemented a wide range of welfare policies. We considered only areas for which we could obtain required labor and welfare data and that were large enough in size for meaningful statistical analysis. In several instances, this meant combining neighboring counties to obtain a region that had an adequate size population. The study regions are listed below.                      Decatur and Florence , Alabama : two of the smallest metropolitan       statistical areas (MSAs) in Alabama including Colbert, Lauderdale, Lawrence,       and Morgan counties.                    Central Oregon : a nonmetropolitan area including Crook, Deschutes,       and Jefferson counties in central Oregon.                            Rural Mississippi : encompasses the entire state, except Biloxi and       Jackson MSAs. It is comprised primarily of nonmetropolitan areas.                    Medford-Ashland, Oregon : a small MSA in southwest Oregon encompassing       Jackson County.                             Joplin, Missouri : a small MSA in southwest Missouri, including Jasper       and Newton counties.

Southeast Missouri : a non- metropolitan area including 23 counties       in southeast Missouri.

Wausau, Wisconsin : a small MSA in central Wisconsin encompassing Marathon       County.                 Because of variation in the demographics, economic conditions, and welfare policies across the regions, we observed variation in the percent reduction in welfare caseloads. As   Exhibit ES.1   shows, all regions experienced reductions in the number of families receiving cash assistance, and most of the regions experienced steeper declines than the U.S. average. In addition, some regions experienced particularly large reductions. Eau Claire and Wausau, Wisconsin reduced caseloads by 45 and 32 percent, respectively, between 1993 and 1996 and another 73 and 70 percent between 1996 and 1998. Medford-Ashland, Oregon, Decatur and Florence, Alabama, and Rural Mississippi also experienced significant reductions. Vermont experienced a relatively small caseload reduction, perhaps due to the statewide waiver that allowed welfare recipients with higher earnings to continue to receive cash benefits.    Exhibit ES.1  Percent Reductions in AFDC/TANF Caseloads        [ Go to  Contents  ]      Basic Findings on Employment and Wages      Our approach begins by comparing the increase of welfare recipients entering the labor market to changes in the low-skill labor force in each of the regions. Essentially, we attempted to answer the following question: Were there enough jobs to absorb the increase of welfare recipients who left for work or who combined welfare and work?   We examined employment and wages at three points in time: 1993, 1996, and 1998. Between 1993 and 1996, we expected to see the effect of the stronger labor market as well as the effect of federal waivers and possible anticipation of PRWORA. Between 1996 and 1998, we expected to see the beginning effects of PRWORA along with the effects of continued growth in the economy. The findings are as follows:            Low-skill employment increased from 1993 to 1996 and from 1996 to 1998     in almost all regions, although the magnitude of the increase varied by     region.      For this study, we defined low-skill employment to include employment in occupations requiring less than one month of on-the-job training and no postsecondary education. Low-skill employment grew at a faster rate than employment in higher-skill occupations. Growth of low-skill employment varied by region, ranging from relatively small increases in the New York regions (and negative growth in North Country between 1993 and 1996) to large increases in the Oregon regions.            Real wages for low-skill workers declined between 1993 and 1996 in many     of the regions, but increased from 1996 to 1998 in all regions.      Between 1993 and 1996, real wages declined in 8 of the 12 regions, with an average annual decline in wages of 0.1 percent. Between 1996 and 1998, wages increased in all regions, with an average annual increase of 1.1 percent. The study regions experienced lower wage growth, on average, than the United States, which experienced no decline between 1993 and 1996 and a 1.9 percent increase between 1996 and 1998. The slower wage growth in the study regions might be due to the characteristics of the population and the trends in industry growth. As is true of rural areas nationally, the share of employment in the manufacturing sector in the study regions declined from 1993 to 1998 and was replaced, in part, by employment in the service sector, which traditionally pays lower wages.            The increase in low-skill jobs exceeded the number of welfare recipients     entering the labor force in all but one region. While welfare recipients     have been leaving welfare for employment in record numbers, they comprise     only a fraction of the employment increase.Because unemployment was not     increasing during this period, it appears that rural labor markets were able     to absorb the increase of welfare recipients.       Exhibit ES.2  presents estimates of the number of welfare recipients newly entering employment and the increase in low-skill employment. The estimate of welfare recipients includes former and current recipients and nets out the number who were in the labor force in 1993. (2)  It also includes individuals who would have entered welfare, but who were diverted from receiving benefits, either because of the growth of the economy or the welfare reform provisions. (3)    As this exhibit shows, the increase in low-skill employment exceeded the number of welfare recipients entering the labor force for all regions, except North Country, between 1993 and 1996. (4)  The average employment growth accounted for by welfare recipients in these regions is roughly 10 percent from 1993 to 1996 and 24 percent from 1996 to 1998. Coupled with the fact that unemployment declined in each of these regions between 1996 and 1998, it appears that the regions could accommodate the inflow of welfare recipients.    Exhibit ES.2   Increase in Low-Skill Employment and Welfare Recipients in Labor Force  As Percent of Low-Skill Employment            Overall, the increase in low-skill employment during the 1993 to 1996 period dwarfed the increase of welfare recipients in the labor market. With the exception of Vermont, the study regions implemented waivers to the AFDC program too late to have had much impact on welfare caseloads during this period. We analyze the 1993 to 1996 period in the body of the report, but limit the remaining discussion here to the 1996 to 1998 period, when welfare reform was clearly a more important factor.   [ Go to  Contents  ]      Approach to Measuring the Impact of     Welfare Reform on Labor Markets      We attempted to estimate the separate contributions of welfare reform and the improved economy to changes in employment and wages in each of the regions. The effect of welfare reform is represented by a shift in the labor supply curve — at every wage, more individuals are seeking work, due to the new welfare policies (see  Exhibit ES.3 ). The improvement in the economy is represented by a shift in the labor demand curve — at every wage, employers are seeking to hire more workers than previously. In  Exhibit ES.3 , under a scenario of economic growth, but without welfare reform, we move from Point A to Point B; welfare reform pushes us to Point C.    Exhibit ES.3  Demand and Supply for Low-Skill Labor        We applied the economic model described above, using employment and wage data collected from U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and state employment security agencies (SESAs), and welfare data collected from state welfare agencies covering the 12 study regions.   Distinguishing between the effects of welfare push and demand pull is difficult, for several reasons. One is that, for the most part, these areas still had historically high unemployment rates in 1993, following the 1991 recession. Hence, they could be reasonably characterized as having an excess supply of labor at going wage rates, which makes application of the demand/supply analysis problematic. In addition, factors other than welfare reform and economic expansion affected some of these areas’ low-skill labor markets during this period. We are aware of three such factors: expansion of the EITC, population growth, and increases in the minimum wage.   [ Go to  Contents  ]      Effect of Shift in Demand and Shift in Supply     on Employment and Wages               The economic expansion, which increased the demand for labor, played a     much larger role in increasing low-skill employment than the shift in     supply.      We decomposed the percentage change in employment into the percentage change as a result of the shift in demand, primarily due to the economic expansion, and the percentage change as a result of the shift in supply, which included both the effects of welfare reform and the effects of other factors, which are discussed below. Between 1996 and 1998, about two-thirds of the increase in employment in these regions was due to the shift in demand and one-third was due to the shift in supply (see  Exhibit ES.4 ). The shift in demand accounted for the greatest share of employment increase in Eau Claire, Wisconsin (82 percent) and the smallest share in Florence, South Carolina (59 percent).    Exhibit ES.4  Percent Change in Employment in Low-Skill Labor Markets, 1996-1998                 The shift in labor supply slowed wage growth, although wages continued     to increase as a result of the economic expansion.       Exhibit ES.5  decomposes the percentage change in wages into the percentage change as a result of the shift in demand (the economic expansion), and the percentage change as a result of the shift in supply (welfare reform, along with other supply factors). As this exhibit shows, between 1996 and 1998, the greater effect of economic expansion offset any reduction in wages due to the shift in the supply.    Exhibit ES.5  Percent Change in Wages in Low-Skill Labor Markets, 1996-1998        [ Go to  Contents  ]      Effect of Welfare Reform on Employment and Wages               Welfare reform likely increased employment and slowed wage growth, but     the effects were small relative to the effects of the economic expansion     and other factors that increased the supply of low-skill labor.      In the discussion above, we noted that the effect of the shift in supply on employment and wages — part of which was due to welfare reform — was smaller than the effect of the economic expansion. We separated out the effect of welfare reform from other factors that contributed to the shift in supply. For this analysis, we assumed that the increase of welfare recipients in the labor force was a direct result of welfare reform, although clearly this overestimates the effect of welfare reform because some of the increase of welfare recipients in the labor force is due to the economic expansion and other factors. However, even using this inflated estimate,  Exhibit ES.6  shows that welfare reform in the study regions increased employment by only 0.6 percent, and reduced wage growth by 2 percentage points. This is less than one-third of the effect, on average, of other supply factors. Also, as we saw above, the effect on employment and wages from the economic expansion exceeded the effect from the entire shift in labor supply.    Exhibit ES.6  Maximum Impact of Welfare Reform and Other Supply Factors  on Changes in Employment and Wages, 1996-1998                   Population growth and net job loss from the 1991 recession also contributed     to the outward shift in labor supply.       Exhibit ES.7  presents the average contribution of three supply factors — welfare reform, population growth, and net job loss from the earlier recession — to the change in employment, with the residual accounting for the remaining unknown factors (each is defined below).    Exhibit ES.7  Factors Contributing to Estimated Shift in Supply on Changes in Employment,  Average Across All Regions, 1996-1998                  Welfare reform:  the maximum effect of welfare reform, assuming the     increase of welfare recipients in the labor force was due to welfare reform.     We estimated that on average, welfare reform accounted for, at most, 29 percent     of the shift in supply.          Net job loss:  the percent reduction in employment between 1989 and     1996. This estimates the number of workers who were available to work in     1996, but who were not working due to the earlier recession. In some regions,     the economy had not recovered to the 1989 levels, so presumably there was     an excess supply of workers who were willing to work at the prevailing wage,     but who were unemployed because wages did not adjust downward. When the economy     began to recover, employers began to demand more labor, and the pool of     unemployed workers in the low-skill labor market likely facilitated an increase     in employment without an increase in wages. Averaged across all 12 regions,     net job loss accounted for 16 percent of the shift in supply on changes in     employment between 1996 and 1998.          Population growth:  the percentage increase in population. Population     growth accounted for about 24 percent of the shift in supply, although this     varied greatly by region.          Residual:  the difference between the total and three identified factors.     The expansion of the EITC, as well as measurement error, may account for     some share of the residual. Approximately 31 percent of the shift in supply     could not be explained by the three other factors.      Exhibit ES.8  presents the contribution by region and the total contribution of the shift in supply on changes in employment. As this exhibit shows, there was significant variation across the regions. For example, we found net job loss in the Oregon regions, Florence, South Carolina, and Vermont, but not in the other regions (the other regions had recovered to the 1989 levels). Population growth occurred in all regions except in the New York regions.    Exhibit ES.8  Factors Contributing to Estimated Shift in Supply on Changes in Employment  By Region, 1996-1998                   In the absence of the economic expansion, welfare recipients would have     taken jobs from other low-skill workers, but the percent of workers displaced     would have been small. Due to the strong economy, no measurable displacement     occurred in any of the regions.      Displacement represents the percentage of low-skill workers who became unemployed because other low-skill workers entered the labor market and drove wages down. If no other factors had affected supply and demand for low-skill workers from 1996 to 1998, we estimated that welfare reform would have displaced no more than 1.7 percent of low-skill workers in any one of the regions, and an average of 0.8 percent across all regions — slightly below the national value of 1.0 percent. The number of welfare recipients who entered employment because of welfare reform is small as a share of the entire low-skill labor force, accounting for little displacement. After considering the effects of demand and other supply factors, we observe no displacement at all, as wages increased in all regions. While the estimates might overlook displacement that occurs at a level of market detail we are not able to observe (e.g., in sub areas of the region, or in specific occupations), we have to conclude that the low-skill labor market in each of these areas had little difficulty in absorbing welfare recipients who entered the market because of welfare reform.   [ Go to  Contents  ]      Projecting the Effect of a Recession      We estimated that, overall, a recession comparable to the recession that occurred in the early 1990s would result in a 5 percent decline in employment in the low-skill labor markets, and a 13 percent decline in wages. (5)  This assumes that wages adjust downward to clear the labor market, which is unlikely. As a result, the decline in employment is likely to be greater.   While the model estimates the decline in employment and wages, it does not predict the effect on former welfare recipients versus other low-skill workers. The effect on former welfare recipients might be disproportionately large if many have not yet firmly established themselves in the labor force. On the other hand, welfare recipients might be more willing to continue work than other low-skill workers as the recession exerts downward pressure on wages or have better work supports that help them maintain employment during an economic downturn.   We also assessed whether welfare reform made the low-skill labor market more sensitive to the impact of a recession than under a scenario with no welfare reform. We conclude that welfare reform would have little consequence for the impact of a recession on the low-skill labor market in these areas because the increase in employment induced by welfare reform is very small as a share of employment, and because wages will have already adjusted to that increase.   [ Go to  Contents  ]      Summary and Implications for Further Research      Overall, we found that between 1993 and 1996, welfare reform had a minimal impact on job displacement and wage reduction. It could have more adversely affected labor markets after 1996, when PRWORA was enacted, but even during this period, the strong economy helped rural and small metropolitan labor markets absorb the inflow of welfare recipients. Even regions that experienced dramatic declines in caseloads, such as the Wisconsin regions, experienced no adverse effects. In a less robust economy, welfare reform likely would have depressed low-skill wage growth and displaced some low-skill workers who were not welfare recipients. The size of these effects, however, appears to be small relative to the effects of other factors whose fluctuations affect low-skill labor markets — such as population growth and the business cycle — because welfare recipients who enter the labor market are a fairly small share of the low-skill labor force in each area.    Several limitations of this study deserve mention:            The magnitude of the estimated effects of welfare reform and the economy     are dependent on the estimates of the elasticity of labor demand and labor     supply. Only national-level estimates are available, and even among these     there is a significant range. Differences in elasticities across rural and     urban areas may exist. We conducted a sensitivity analysis (incrementing     and decrementing the elasticities by 0.1) and found that our basic findings     are not affected much by reasonable changes in the elasticities as a result     of the small size of the increase in employment due to welfare reform relative     to the low-skill labor market.         The estimates of welfare recipients who entered the labor market relied on     estimates obtained from a national leaver study. If differences in the percent     of leavers who entered the labor market differ between rural and urban areas,     then the maximum effect of welfare reform on employment and wages could differ     from the ones presented.         We cannot account for the effect of the EITC in our estimates. We believe     the expansion primarily affected the 1993 to 1996 period, and may have affected     some of the unexplained shift in the supply curve during this period. A recent     study separated the effect of EITC expansions from the effect of welfare     policies and local labor market conditions, and found that EITC expansions     have a large positive effect on employment of adults from welfare     families. (6)          We allocated industry payroll to low-skill, medium-skill, and high-skill     occupations in each of the three years based on the payroll distribution     of occupations within industries in 1998; distributions for earlier years     did not exist. The extent to which the percent distribution differed between     1993 and 1998 affects our low-skill wage estimates, but not the employment     estimates.         We found that welfare reform did not significantly affect the market for     low-skill labor because the market is large relative to the number of welfare     recipients entering it. Because we defined the low-skill market narrowly      — assuming that welfare recipients sought jobs that required little     education or on-the-job training — we believe we might be     over-estimating, and not under-estimating, the effect of welfare reform on     labor markets.     Future studies could augment this study by collecting additional information and using other data sources not available to us at the time of this study. In addition, more will be learned about the effect of time limits on reducing caseloads and the effect of welfare reform during periods of slow economic growth. Future studies could address the following:           In the next few years, as more welfare recipients reach time limits and as     the economy slows and, perhaps, enters a recession, will welfare recipients     begin to displace low-skill workers and affect wage levels? Will they be     more or less vulnerable to job loss than other low-skill workers? To conduct     future analysis, researchers will be able to rely on the Occupational Employment     Statistics survey, which began collecting wage information starting in 1996.     This survey is also a better source for employment information by occupation.     Finally, some of the confounding factors we encountered — such     as the EITC and the effects of the earlier recession — will not     have as large an effect on the estimates going forward.         Are welfare leavers in rural areas more or less likely to enter the labor     force than their counterparts in urban areas? To date, leaver studies have     focused primarily on urban areas and offer little information on the labor     force participation of welfare leavers living in more rural areas. An analysis     of national data sets, such as the National Survey of America’s Families,     focusing on welfare recipients living in rural areas could supplement this     study. In addition, some leaver studies include an adequate sample size of     individuals residing in rural areas; future research could analyze these     subsamples in more detail.         Are welfare offices in rural areas able to offer the job search and job training     assistance available in urban areas? What percent of the welfare population     in rural areas are exempt from time limits and work participation requirements     because of the lack of services? Field research or phone surveys targeting     these study regions could provide useful information on the issues facing     welfare offices in rural labor markets, and provide context for some of the     findings from this study.         What types of jobs are welfare recipients taking? Did we narrow the field     to the correct set of occupations? Are these jobs likely to evaporate during     a downturn? Field research conducted in some of these study regions would     supplement the analysis from this study.     [ Go to  Contents  ]      Endnotes       (1)   From P. Loprest and S. Brauner (1999).

GX247-24-7579610	"© Copyright 1999 by the Wyoming Department of Employment, Research & Planning       Tough Times for Texas Oil  (*)   by:   Larry Jones and Mark Dermit  introduction by:   Carol Kjar, Statistical Technician       ""According to the Energy Information Administration, a slight rise in oil prices from their historically low levels is anticipated.""       I n the course of our research, we often compare the economies and industries of Wyoming with other states. For example, consider the similarities and differences between Texas and Wyoming oil industries.  There are counties in Texas that are heavily dependent on the oil industry and have been seriously affected by the low oil prices of the past year.  The following article describes the economic situations in those counties.  While Wyoming has a large oil industry as well, we also have large quantities of natural gas and coal that are helping our economy remain more stable than in parts of Texas.  Economic diversity appears to counterbalance industry fluctuations.  Without this stabilizing influence, some of Wyomings counties could face the same economic declines as certain counties in Texas.       A t the beginning of this century, in January of 1901, when the historic Spindletop well gushed its first of many millions of barrels of oil, the Texas oil industry was in its infancy, and the price of oil soon plummeted to a mere three cents per barrel. Having reached a peak of $38 per barrel in the early 1980s, the posted price for West Texas Intermediate crude has now fallen to a modern-day low of $9.30 for the month of February 1999. In turn, this has had a drastic effect on local labor markets and economies hard hit by the dismal state of world oil prices and associated layoffs.   This current state of affairs was precipitated by events largely external to Texas, as North Sea oil producers stepped up their output along with others in South America, Africa, and to a lesser extent, the Middle East. This, combined with the less-than-normal demand for home heating oil across North America during the fall and winter of 1998-1999, has led to far-reaching effects here in Texas. Finally, several mergers of some of the worlds largest oil companies have resulted in consolidations, which potentially will cause more layoffs.                                               The oil and gas industry, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 13, includes both the exploration for, and extraction of, oil and natural gas, the production of oil and gas from various sources up to the point of shipment, and oil and gas field services. Employment in the Texas oil and gas industry hit its heyday in January 1982 with a peak of 313,700 jobs out of 6,271,400 total Nonagricultural Wage and Salary jobs statewide. This represented fully 5.0 percent of the total Texas labor market. Ensuing worldwide competition in oil production and increased efficiencies in exploration and drilling techniques have subsequently caused a significant drop in Texas oil and gas industry employment since that period. In fact, in January 1999, employment had fallen by more than half to 152,300 jobs while Total Nonagricultural Wage and Salary Employment grew by more than 2.7 million jobs to a total of 8,988,200. Today, the oil and gas industry accounts for only 1.7 percent of the total. One of the principal indicators of the health of the oil and gas industry along with employment is the oil and gas drilling rig count. Understandably, the rig count closely mirrored employment in the oil and gas industry, peaking in 1981 at nearly 1,450 rigs in service. That figure fell to as little as 380 in March 1998 (its high point for the year) and now stands at a paltry 199, a 47.6 percent drop in eleven months. Oil and gas losses in some West Texas counties have been severe recently, affecting not just the level of employment, but adversely impacting property appraisals as well. The loss of tax revenues has a domino effect on the local community, which will constrain local government budgets including numerous independent school districts. These effects are often most prominent in counties which have a less-diversified economy and which have small or medium-sized populations.   The sudden upturn in unemployment is now having a detrimental impact on local communities. This includes not only the obvious effects of idled rigs, businesses cutting back, and people being laid off and filing claims for unemployment insurance benefits or public assistance, but other not-so-obvious consequences. As previously mentioned, local tax revenues in parts of the state are being severely affected by this downturn. Several independent school districts in West Texas are estimating their losses upwards of $5,000,000. In addition, some rural hospitals supported by county budgets are being hard hit by the reduction in revenue, and will have to consider alternative funding or cutbacks. Likewise, some city and county governments will have to trim budgets, and perhaps services, to account for the expected loss in revenue. Finally, many private individuals in Texas will suffer losses of revenue from oil leases and royalties.   Is there room for optimism? According to the Energy Information Administration, a slight rise in oil prices from their historically low levels is anticipated. Domestic producers have stated they need at least $12 to $15 per barrel to break even and considerably above that to begin new drilling. Aided by increased demand from recovering Asian markets and from other emerging economies, the world price for crude oil is expected to rise to $14.25 per barrel by the year 2000. Some state revenue estimators have echoed that forecast, predicting that prices could increase by as much as 25 percent by the end of the year. Beyond the millennium, economists are predicting gradual but steady growth in world demand.  Along with increased demand though, will come an increase in the world supply as North Sea producers, some South American countries, and offshore production near Africa and Asia will all contribute added output. In short, if world demand grows faster than world supply, the Texas oil and gas industry can presumably hold its own, but any recovery from our current position will likely occur over a matter of years and not months.    *   Reprinted with permission from the  February 1999 issue  of  The Texas Labor Market Review , a monthly publication produced by the Labor Market Information Department of the Texas Workforce Commission ( http://www.twc.state.tx.us/ ).

A shrinking budget deficit, low interest rates, a stable macroeconomic environment, expanding international trade with fewer barriers, and effective private sector management are all credited with playing a role in this healthy economic performance. Many observers believe advances in information technology (IT), driven by the growth of the Internet,*1 have also contributed to creating this healthier-than-expected economy. In recent testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan noted, ""...our nation has been experiencing a higher growth rate of productivity--output per hour--worked in recent years. The dramatic improvements in computing power and communication and information technology appear to have been a major force behind this beneficial trend.""1 Some have even suggested that these advances will create a ""long boom""2 which will take the economy to new heights over the next quarter century. Other economists remain skeptical about the contribution of the IT industry to overall productivity. As yet, there is limited direct evidence in government data that investments in IT have substantially raised productivity in many non-IT industries.3 While the full economic impact of information impact is significant. IT industries have been economy-- a trend that is likely to continue. all business equipment investment. Declining inflation. technology cannot yet be precisely evaluated, its growing at more than double the rate of the overall Investments in IT now represent over 45 percent of prices for IT products have lowered overall  This report also begins a discussion about the potential impact on the economy of the Internet and electronic commerce. Recent rapid growth of the Internet is in part attributable to its strength as a medium of communication, education and entertainment, and, more recently, as a tool for electronic commerce.  * The Internet is a global matrix of interconnected computer networks using the Internet Protocol (IP) to communicate with each other. For simplicity, the term ""Internet"" is used throughout this paper to encompass all such data networks and hundreds of applications such as the World Wide Web and e-mail that run on those networks, even though some electronic commerce activities may take place on proprietary or other networks that are not technically part of the Internet. 1   Businesses in virtually every sector of the economy are beginning to use the Internet to cut the cost of purchasing, manage supplier relationships, streamline logistics and inventory, plan production, and reach new and existing customers more effectively. Cost savings, increased consumer choice and improved consumer convenience are driving growth in the sale of physical goods and in the digital delivery of goods and services via the Internet. Because the Internet is new and its uses are developing very rapidly, reliable economy-wide statistics are hard to find. Further research is needed. This report therefore uses industry and company examples to illustrate the rapid pace at which Internet commerce is being deployed and the benefits being realized. Examples showing the growth of the Internet and electronic commerce this past year are numerous:  Fewer than 40 million people around the world were connected to the Internet during 1996. By the end of 1997, more than 100 million people were using the Internet.4 As of December 1996, about 627,000 Internet domain names had been registered. By the end of 1997, the number of domain names more than doubled to reach 1.5 million.5 Traffic on the Internet has been doubling every 100 days.6 Cisco Systems closed 1996 having booked just over $100 million in sales on the Internet. By the end of 1997, its Internet sales were running at a $3.2 billion annual rate. In 1996, Amazon.com, the first Internet bookstore, recorded sales of less than $16 million. In 1997, it sold $148 million worth of books to Internet customers. One of the nation's largest book retailers, Barnes and Noble, launched its own online bookstore in 1997 to compete with Amazon for this rapidly growing online market. In January 1997, Dell Computers was selling less than $1 million of computers per day on the Internet. The company reported reaching daily sales of $6 million several times during the December 1997 holiday period. Auto-by-Tel, a Web-based automotive marketplace, processed a total of 345,000 purchase requests for autos through its Web site in 1996, for $1.8 billion in auto sales. As of the end of November 1997, the Web site was generating $500 million a month in auto sales ($6 billion annualized) and processed over 100,000 purchase requests each month.             If the trends suggested by this preliminary analysis continue, IT and electronic commerce can be expected to drive economic growth for many years to come. To realize this potential, however, the private sector and governments must work together to create a predictable, market-driven legal framework to facilitate electronic commerce; to create non-bureaucratic means that ensure that the Internet is a safe environment; and to create human resource policies that endow students and workers with the skills necessary for jobs in the new digital economy. 2   CHAPTER ONE: THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION  The Industrial Revolution was powered by the steam engine, invented in 1712,7 and electricity, first harnessed in 1831.8 Harnessing the power of steam meant less labor was needed for manual work; it also meant that factories could locate anywhere, not just in geographical areas with strong wind and water resources. Because it required a network to contain and transmit its power, electricity's potential had to wait until 50 years after it was first harnessed before the first power station was built in 1882.9 It took another 50 years before electricity powered 80 percent of factories and households across the country (Figure 1).10  Figure 1. Diffusion of Electric Power in the U.S., 1899-1939 100 90 80 Percentage diffusion 70 60 50 40 30 20  factories households  Early uses of electricity were limited. While factories used 10 generators for lighting, their 0 primary power still came from line 1899 1919 1929 1939 shafts and belt drives up to 1907. Factories - primary and secondary electric motor HP's as proportion of total mechanical drive in mfg. Household - proportion of U.S. dwellings wired for electric lighting. It was not until factories replaced Source: David, Paul. ""The Dynamo and the Computer: An Historical Perspective on the Modern Productivity Paradox."" the old power system for electric motors that fundamental changes in production occurred. Factory structures were streamlined, and key processes, such as materials handling and manufacturing flows, were made more efficient.11 The digital revolution is happening much more quickly. The harnessing of light for nearly instantaneous communications and the ability to use microscopic circuits to process and store huge amounts of information are enabling this current economic transformation. In 1946, the world's first programmable computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), stood 10 feet tall, stretched 150 feet wide, cost millions of dollars, and could execute up to 5,000 operations per second. Twenty-five years later, in 1971, Intel packed 12 times ENIAC's processing power into a 12 mm2 chip with a $200 price tag.12 Today's personal computers (PCs) with Pentium processors perform in excess of 400 million instructions per second (MIPS). At the current pace of development, by 2012, PCs will be able to handle 100,000 million instructions per second.13 3   As late as 1980, phone conversations only traveled over copper wires which carried less than one page of information per second. Today, a strand of optical fiber as thin as a human hair can transmit in a single second the equivalent of over 90,000 volumes of an encyclopedia.14 By 2002, a constellation of several hundred satellites orbiting hundreds of miles above the earth is expected to bring high-bandwidth15 communications to businesses, schools and individuals everywhere on the planet. A global digital network using new packet switching technology16 combines the power of these remarkable innovations in computing and communication. The Internet ties together the computing power on desks, in factories and in offices around the world through a high-speed communications infrastructure. More than 100 million people around the world, most of whom had never heard of the Internet four years ago, now use it to do research, send e-mail to friends, make requests for bids to suppliers, and shop for cars or books. The Internet's pace of adoption eclipses all other technologies that preceded it. Radio was in existence 38 years before 50 million people tuned in; TV took 13 years to reach that benchmark. Sixteen years after the first PC kit came out, 50 million people were using one.17 Once it was opened to the general public, the Internet crossed that line in four years.18 Growing Economic Importance of the IT Sector: One of the most notable economic developments in recent years has been the rapid increase Figure 2. IT's Share of the Economy Grows in the IT sector's (computing and communications) share of 9 investment activity and of the 8.2 8 gross domestic product (GDP). 7 It grew from 4.9 percent of the 6.4 6.1 6 economy in 1985 to 6.1 percent 4.9 5 4.5 by 1990 as the PC began to 4.2 4 penetrate homes and offices. The 3 next spurt started in 1993, with 2 the burst of commercial activity 1 driven by the Internet. From 0 1993 to 1998, the IT share of the 1977 1980 1985 1990 1993 1998 economy will have risen from 6.4 Source: U.S. Department of Commerce Economics and Statistics Administration percent to an estimated 8.2 Estimates based on Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census data percent (Figure 2). With such rapid expansion, IT's share of total nominal GDP growth has been running almost double its share of the economy, at close to 15 percent. % of GDP  4   What makes this rise in IT's nominal share of the economy even more remarkable is the fact that IT prices, adjusted for quality and performance improvements, have been falling while prices in the rest of the economy have been rising. Computing power has been doubling every 18 months for the past 30 years. At the same time, the average price of a transistor has fallen by six orders of magnitude, due to microprocessor development. In just six years' time, the cost of microprocessor computing power has decreased from $230 to $3.42 per MIPS (Figure 3). No other manufactured item has decreased in cost so far, so fast.19  Figure 3. Microprocessor Prices Plummet from $230 per MIPS to $3.42 per MIPS in 6 years 250 230  200 $ per MIPS  150  100  50  50 16 3.42  0 1991 1994  1995  1997  Source: Intel  Year-to-Year Price Change* (%)  In 1996 and 1997, declining prices in IT industries lowered overall inflation by one full percentage point (Figure 4). Without the contribution of the IT sector, overall inflation, at 2.0 percent, would have been 3.1 percent in 1997.  Figure 4.

In recent years, IT industries have been responsible for more than one-quarter of real economic growth (Figure 5).20 % of Real Economic Growth  Figure 5.

In the 1960s, business spending on IT equipment represented only 3 percent of total business equipment investment. In 1996, IT's share rose to 45 percent (Figure 6). For some industries like communications, insurance and investment brokerages, IT equipment constitutes over threequarters of all equipment investment. Information technology supports high-paying jobs. In 1996, 7.4 million people worked in IT industries and in IT-related occupations across the economy. They earned close to $46,000 per year, compared to an average of $28,000 for the private sector. The impact of IT is also reflected in the capital IT firms currently represent. The collective market capitalizations of five major companies, Microsoft, Intel, Compaq, Dell and Cisco, has grown to over $588 billion in 1997 from under $12 billion in 1987,21 close to a fifty-fold increase in the space of a decade.

Growth could accelerate in the coming years not only in the IT sector itself, but across all sectors of the economy as the number of people connected to the Internet multiplies and as its commercial use grows. The growth will be driven by four types of economic activity:  Building out the Internet: In 1994, three million people, most of them in the United States, used the Internet.22 In 1998, 100 million people around the world use the Internet.23 Some experts believe that one billion people may be connected to the Internet by 2005.24 This expansion is driving dramatic increases in computer, software, services and communications investments. Electronic commerce among businesses: Businesses began using the Internet for commercial transactions with their business partners about two years ago. Early users already report significant productivity improvements from using electronic networks to create, buy, distribute, sell, and service products and services. By 2002, the Internet may be used for more than $300 billion worth of commerce between businesses.25 Digital delivery of goods and services: Software programs, newspapers, and music CDs no longer need to be packaged and delivered to stores, homes or news kiosks. They can be delivered electronically over the Internet. Airline tickets and securities transactions over the Internet already occur in large numbers. Other industries such as consulting services, entertainment, banking and insurance, education and health care face some hurdles but are also beginning to use the Internet to change the way they do business. Over time, the sale and transmission of goods and services electronically is likely to be the largest and most visible driver of the new digital economy. Retail sale of tangible goods: The Internet can also be used to order tangible goods and services that are produced, stored and physically delivered. Though Internet sales are less than 1 percent of total retail sales today, sales of certain products such as computers, software, cars, books and flowers are growing rapidly.        7   CHAPTER TWO: BUILDING OUT THE INTERNET  Where advances in telecommunications and computing largely occurred side-by-side in the past, today, they converge in the Internet. Soon, virtually all information technology investment will be part of interlinked communications systems, whether internal to a business, between businesses, between individuals and businesses, or individual to individual. However measured, the Internet is expanding at a very rapid pace. For instance, the number of Americans using the Internet has grown from fewer than 5 million in 1993 to as many as 62 million by 1997.26 UUNET, one of the largest Internet backbone providers, estimates that Internet traffic doubles every 100 days.27 The number of names registered in the domain name system grew from 26,000 in July 1993 to 1.3 million in four years. Over the same period, the number of hosts connected to the Internet expanded from under 1.8 million to over 19.5 million (Table 1). Table 1. Growth of Internet Hosts and Domain Names* (000s) # Hosts July 93 July 94 July 95 July 96 July 97 1,776 3,212 6,642 12,881 19,540 # Domains 26 46 120 488 1,301  * Internet host refers to a computer that is connected to the Internet that has a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address. A domain name represents a record within the Domain Name System. Source: Network Wizards http://www.nw.com  In January 1995, just over 27,000 top-level commercial (.com) domain names were assigned. Most businesses used them for little more than posting product and company descriptions, store locations, annual reports and information about how to contact corporate headquarters. Two and a half years later, commercial domain names number 764,000.28 Static brochures and bulletin boards are giving way to full-fledged businesses offering financial services, news and information, manufactured goods, and travel and entertainment to individuals and businesses. To meet this increased demand, consumer electronics companies, media giants, phone companies, computer companies, software firms, satellite builders, cell phone businesses, Internet service providers, television cable companies and, in a few cases, electric utilities, are aggressively investing to build out the Internet.  8   Hundreds of new firms are starting up around the country to help businesses use the World Wide Web effectively. They design Web sites and advertising banners, create Web-based catalogs, build security tools, create and track direct marketing campaigns, provide consulting services, and develop technology to speed the flow of data and information across the network. Venture capitalists gave just under $12 billion to hundreds of information technology start-ups in 1996 and 1997.29  Making the Internet Faster and More Accessible Households typically connect to the Internet through a PC and a telephone line. This method of access means that most households without PCs (just under 60 percent of all U.S. households30) do not have Internet access. It also means that most Internet connections from the home are slow.31 To illustrate the importance of speed, it takes 46 minutes to download a 3.5-minute video using a 28.8 kbps (thousand bits per second) modem, the modem most commonly used by households today (Table 2). Table 2. Time to Download 3.5-Minute Video Clip Using Different Technologies Transfer Time 28.8 Kbps modem 128 Kbps ISDN 4 Mbps cable modem 8 Mbps ADSL 10 Mbps cable modem 46 minutes 10 minutes 20 seconds 10 seconds 8 seconds  Telephone companies, satellite companies, cable service providers and others are Source: FCC, CS Docket No. 96-496, 1997; ADSL from Werbach working to create faster Internet 1997, p. 75. connections and expand the means by which users can access the Internet. New technologies such as ADSL (Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line) enable copper telephone lines to send data at speeds up to 8 million bits per second (mbps). At this speed, that same 3.5 minute video takes 10 seconds to download.32 PC manufacturers and software developers are also taking steps to make home computers cheaper and easier to use.33 Some PCs can now be purchased for less than $1,000 apiece. New network computers are expected to be introduced at prices of a few hundred dollars apiece. At the same time, new and enhanced software programs (for instance, better graphical user interfaces, search tools, and voice recognition technology) will make the PC and the Internet easier to use and thereby able to reach a broader community of consumers. Soon, many Americans will be using their televisions to access the Internet. Present in nearly every household, TVs are easy to operate and require little or no maintenance. Digital broadcasting services (high-definition television, or HDTV) will be available in the top ten markets by November 1999, and broadcasters are expected to make the transition to digital 9   broadcasting by 2006.34 With digital broadcasting, TV viewers will be able to interact with their televisions and surf the Web, pay bills, plan a weekend trip, or make dinner reservations. Already, satellite dishes and signals carried over cable television lines enable consumers to receive data from the Internet through their TVs and television programming through their personal computers. At speeds of 10 million bits per second, a household connected to the Internet via a cable modem can download a 3.5-minute video in 8 seconds.35 In most cases today, however, the outgoing communication (the speed at which the Internet receives the commands by the user) is still limited to the fastest modem speeds that copper telephone wires will support. Two-way cable traffic would be much faster, but only 9 percent of the 103 million cable subscribers in the U.S. and Canada (9 million homes) live in zones where two-way cable connectivity exists. And, only a small number of them--111,000--have actually subscribed to the service. By 2000, analysts estimate that two-way cable connectivity will be available to 34 million households, of which 1.6 million are expected to subscribe to the service.36 Cable operators are planning to make significant investments in the next few years to upgrade their systems to carry two-way Internet traffic. The wait for broadband Internet access to households is measured in years, not decades. Within the next five to ten years, the vast majority of Americans should be able to interact with the Internet from their television sets, watch television on their PCs, and make telephone calls from both devices. These combined services will be brought to homes by satellite, wireless, microwave, television cable and telephone lines, all interconnected in one overall system. People will also access the Internet away from their homes or offices. Cellular telephones and portable digital assistants (PDAs) have become very sophisticated devices capable of sending faxes, receiving e-mail and electronic pages, and now, accessing the Internet. Industry experts predict that users of cellular phones and digital personal communications devices will more than triple from 77 million to 251 million by 1999.37 Technology already exists to enable many appliances and consumer electronics devices to transmit and receive data. The first products to link home appliances with PCs should become available this year. Entering a simple message into a computer on a desk will be able to turn off the television or pre-heat the oven for dinner. Automobiles with video monitors will receive data from overhead satellites to warn about traffic jams, give directions to the nearest gas station, and deliver the latest news and information. The U.S. Government's FY 1999 budget calls for $850 million to be invested in high-performance computing and communications. As part of this effort, the budget provides $110 million for the Next Generation Internet Initiative, which will create a research network that is 100 to 1,000 times faster than today's Internet, and invests in R&D for smarter, faster networks that support new applications, such as telemedicine, distance learning and real-time collaboration.  10   Table 3. The Race to Build Out the Communications Infrastructure of the Internet During the 19th and 20th centuries, governments played a key role in helping build or actively regulate much of the country's transportation, communication and energy infrastructure powering the Industrial Revolution. Although the Internet originated in U.S. Defense Department research, private sector investments will largely drive its future expansion. Telecommunications: Manufacturers and software companies have been developing new technologies to allow higher-bandwidth communications across the existing copper network infrastructure, including DSL technologies, compression and faster electronic switches. Communications carriers around the world are building out fiber optic networks; technological advancements including optical amplification and new photonic switches make these high-speed networks more powerful and more efficient. Satellite: Satellite, telecommunications, electronics and aerospace companies plan to spend close to $27 billion to build out a global broadband network in the sky between 1998-2002 to reach most of the two billion people that live in areas around the world where phone service is unavailable. Cable: Thick cable wires pass more than 90 percent of U.S. households, piping in TV programming at speeds much faster than telephone copper carries voice traffic. Four years ago, many cable companies began to prepare the cable network for two-way Internet traffic, investing in fiber optic cable and set-top boxes to decipher voice, video and data sent in digital form. Wireless: Over time, wireless networks will be integrated with the Internet. Investments in satellites and repeater stations are now being made at a rapid rate to accomplish this. Cellular phones, pagers and hand-held computers will be able to transmit and receive voice, data and Internet traffic. Electric utilities: A number of utility companies around the country are beginning to lay thousands of miles of new fiber cable for Internet access at speeds ten times faster than today's high-speed phone connections.  As the number of Internet users grows, accessing the Internet becomes faster and easier to do, and as the number of Internet-enabled devices multiplies, the IT industry's share of the economy can be expected to continue to expand rapidly.  11   CHAPTER THREE: ELECTRONIC COMMERCE BETWEEN BUSINESSES  Internet commerce is growing fastest among businesses. It is used for coordination between the purchasing operations of a company and its suppliers; the logistics planners in a company and the transportation companies that warehouse and move its products; the sales organizations and the wholesalers or retailers that sell its products; and the customer service and maintenance operations and the company's final customers. Early computers were used for scientific and military purposes, not for commerce. They first made their way into commercial applications in the 1960s, with ERMA (the Electronic Recording Machine--Accounting). Banks were swamped with the growing volume of checks that needed to be processed (between 1943 and 1952, check use had doubled from 4 billion to 8 billion checks written each year). By automating the function with ERMA, the first bank to use the computer, Bank of America, reported that nine employees could do the job that previously took 50 people.38 The commercial use of computers quickly spread as companies in a variety of industries used them to keep accounting ledgers, administer payroll, create management reports, and schedule production. In the 1970s and 1980s, businesses extended their computing power beyond the company's walls, sending and receiving purchase orders, invoices and shipping notifications electronically via EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). EDI is a standard for compiling and transmitting information between computers, often over private communications networks called value-added networks (VANs). The 1980s also brought the introduction of computer-aided design (CAD), computeraided engineering (CAE) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems that enabled engineers, designers and technicians to access and work on design specifications, engineering drawings and technical documentation via internal corporate communications networks. The cost of installation and maintenance of VANs put electronic communication out of the reach of many small and medium-sized businesses. For the most part, these businesses relied on the fax and telephone for their business communications. Even larger companies that used EDI often did not realize the full potential savings because many of their business partners did not use it. The Internet makes electronic commerce affordable to even the smallest home office. Companies of all sizes can now communicate with each other electronically, through the public Internet, networks for company-use only (intranets) or for use by a company and its business partners (extranets), and private value-added networks. Companies are quickly moving to utilize the expanded opportunities created by the Internet. For instance, Cisco Systems, Dell Computers and Boeing's spare parts business report almost 12   immediate benefits after putting their ordering and customer service operations on the Internet. They are so convinced of its benefit to their own companies and their customers that they believe most of their business will involve the Internet in the next three to five years.39 Although still in an embryonic stage, analysts predict businesses will trade as much as $300 billion annually over the Internet in the next five years.40 Some believe the volume of Internet commerce will be much higher. As statistically valid sampling data are not yet available, determining the actual growth rate is very difficult to do. This report does not attempt to size the current market or predict the size of the future market. Instead, it describes the underlying drivers of growth of business-to-business electronic commerce, using specific company and industry examples as illustrations. Growth of business-to-business electronic commerce is being driven by lower purchasing costs, reductions in inventories, lower cycle times, more efficient and effective customer service, lower sales and marketing costs and new sales opportunities.  LOWER PURCHASING COSTS Buying materials or services for a corporation can be a complex, multi-step process. First, purchasers have to find suppliers who make the product and determine whether they meet volume, delivery, quality and price requirements. Once a potential supplier has been chosen, detailed drawings and information are transmitted to the supplier so that the product is built to exact customer specifications. Assuming the product sample has been approved and the supplier's manufacturing lines are ready for production, the buyer then transmits a purchase order (P.O.) for a specific quantity of goods. The buyer, meanwhile, receives notification from the supplier that the P.O. was received and confirmation that the order can be met. When the product ships from the supplier, the buyer again receives notification, along with an invoice for goods delivered. The buyer's accounting department matches the invoice with the P.O. and pays the invoice. When changes to the normal order happen--a frequent occurrence in most companies--the process can be much more complicated. Companies lower procurement costs by consolidating purchases and developing relationships with key suppliers to benefit from volume discounts and tighter integration in the manufacturing process. They also cast a wide net for lower-cost sources of supply. Large companies have been using EDI over private networks to reduce labor, printing and mailing costs in the procurement process. Automating routine procurement means the procurement staff has more time to focus on negotiating better prices and building supplier relationships. Analysts estimate that businesses already trade well over $150 billion in goods and services using EDI over VANs.41 Companies using EDI commonly save 5-10 percent in procurement costs.42 The Internet has the potential to further reduce procurement costs. Large companies benefit from lower transmission costs versus private networks. The Internet also opens the door to doing 13   business electronically with new suppliers and with small and medium-sized suppliers who formerly communicated only via fax or phone. Small companies also benefit. The Internet reduces processing costs and opens up new sales opportunities from potential buyers that post requests for bids on the Internet. Procurement via the Internet is new enough that projecting economy-wide savings or other benefits is difficult. Specific company examples suggest that its potential is large and growing. For instance, General Electric's lighting division reports significant gains in responsiveness, improved service, and reduced labor and material costs as a result of shifting purchasing from a largely manual system to an electronic one using Internet protocols. Factories at General Electric's lighting division used to send hundreds of requisitions for quotes (RFQs) to the corporate sourcing department each day for low-value machine parts. For each requisition, the accompanying blueprints had to be requested from storage, retrieved from the vault, transported on site, photocopied, folded, attached to paper requisition forms with quote sheets, stuffed into envelopes and mailed out. The process took at least seven days and was so complex and time-intensive that the sourcing department normally only sent out bid packages to two to three suppliers at a time. In 1996, GE Lighting piloted the company's first online procurement system, TPN Post, an extranet developed by GE Information Services. Now, the sourcing department receives the requisitions electronically from its internal customers and can send off a bid package to suppliers around the world via the Internet. The system automatically pulls the correct drawings and attaches them to the electronic requisition forms. Within two hours from the time the sourcing department starts the process, suppliers are notified of incoming RFQs by e-mail, fax or EDI. A bid can be evaluated and awarded the same day GE receives it. Previously, more than one them with purchase orders beginning to end, invoices modifications that happen out of four invoices had to be investigated and ""reworked"" to reconcile and receipts. With the transaction handled electronically from are now automatically reconciled with purchase orders, reflecting any along the way.  According to GE, the division's labor costs for procurement have declined by 30 percent. Sixty percent of the procurement staff have been redeployed. The sourcing department has at least six to eight additional days a month to concentrate on strategic activities rather than the paperwork, photocopying and envelope stuffing it had to do when the process was manual. Material costs have declined by up to 20 percent as the ability to reach a wider base of suppliers online created more competition and led to lower prices. As of October 1997, eight divisions of General Electric use TPN for some of their procurement. The company bought more than $1 billion worth of goods and supplies via the Internet in 1997. By 2000, GE aims to have all 12 of its business units purchasing its non-production and maintenance, repair and operations materials (MRO) via the Internet, for a total of $5 billion. GE 14   estimates that streamlining these purchases alone could save the company $500-$700 million over the next three years.43 Other companies report plans to use the Internet for procurement. One out of four purchasing managers expects to use the Internet for MRO purchases, up from 10 percent who use it for that purpose today.44  REDUCED INVENTORY/THE RIGHT PRODUCTS IN STOCK The longer it takes for production schedules to reach suppliers, the more inventory a company has to hold to account for delays and errors, and the less quickly it can react to changes in demand. The more inventory a company holds, the higher its operating costs, and the lower its profits. Carrying more inventory does not ensure better customer service, either. Shelves weighed down with size-10 running shoes do not help the customer who wears a size 8. When a customer enters a furniture showroom looking for an armchair with green and white stripes and is told it's on back-order for 12 weeks, he may drive across town to a competitor rather than wait. Managing inventory properly results in better service for the customer and lower operating costs for the company. Increasing the frequency of inventory ""turns"" (the number of times inventory in existing warehouse or store space is sold or used for production each year) reduces inventoryrelated interest, handling and storage costs. Reducing inventory levels also means that existing manufacturing capacity is more efficiently utilized. More efficient production can reduce or eliminate the need for additional investments in plant and equipment. IBM's Personal Systems Group provides an illustration of how the Internet and private networks are helping companies keep stocks of inventory smaller, yet more targeted on likely consumer needs. Each month, the group's marketing departments report information on how many PCs they think will be sold. The production planning departments identify manufacturing and materials capacity in each factory. Armed with inputs from across the company on demand and supply, production schedules are assigned to each factory. The procurement staff uses the same information to negotiate with suppliers. As new information comes in each week, the process is repeated and the production schedule fine-tuned. Electronic communication between factories, marketing and purchasing departments have made this quick response possible. Problems are communicated as they arise and the appropriate adjustments are made. If demand suddenly rises or if one factory cannot meet its production schedule, IBM is aware of it in time to increase production at another factory. The Personal Systems Group has been phasing in this Advanced Planning System (APS) since 1996 and already reports significant results. During the first year of APS, inventory turns 15   increased 40 percent over the previous year, and sales volumes increased by 30 percent. The group anticipates another 50 percent increase in turns and a 20 percent increase in sales volume in 1997. By better utilizing its existing manufacturing capacity, IBM has avoided having to make additional investments to meet the increased volume requirements. The lower investment and operating costs due to improved inventory turns have resulted in savings of $500 million. IBM is not alone in its efforts to use networks to improve communication between the marketing and sales arm of a business and its production units. Manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers are working together to form standards and guidelines for better forecasting and restocking called Collaborative Planning Forecasting Replenishment (CPFR). These standards will allow companies to collaborate in determining future demand for products and to share information about the availability of products in stock. With CPFR, a retailer and its supplier electronically post their latest sets of forecasts for a list of products. A server tied to the Internet compares the forecasts and flags differences in those that exceed a normal safety margin--say 5 percent. Differences are then reconciled by planners at both the retailer and the supplier. To keep that process from becoming too cumbersome, software companies are working to develop programs that automatically handle exception messages based on rules that apply to that business.45 The accounting and consulting firm Ernst & Young believes that CPFR could yield an inventory reduction of $250 billion to $350 billion across the economy. By reducing inventory levels, businesses will realize substantial savings in materials handling, warehousing, and general administrative costs.46  LOWER CYCLE TIMES Cycle time is the total time it takes to build a product. There are certain fixed costs associated with building any product that do not vary with the amount of production, but rather are time dependent. These ""fixed"" costs include depreciation of equipment, most utility and building costs, and most managerial and supervisory time. If the time to build a product can be reduced to seven days instead of ten, then the fixed costs per product are lower since less time was needed. Electronic commerce allows ""cycle times"" to be shortened, allowing more to be produced for the same or lower costs. In the 1980s, the lower cycles times realized by Japanese companies presented American companies with a serious competitive challenge. They responded by breaking down organizational barriers that had grown up between design, manufacturing and sales divisions and improving communications with external partners. Establishing electronic links with their large suppliers and customers enabled companies to transmit and receive purchase orders, invoices and shipping notifications with much shorter lead times than previously. Some also began to share product specifications and drawings over valueadded networks to speed product design and development.  16   The Internet will permit even further reductions by broadening the network of businesses connected electronically and by facilitating collaboration on projects across work teams and geographical locations. Few industries faced a greater challenge to reduce cycle times than the automotive industry in the early 1980s. While Japanese automakers could take a car from concept to mass production in approximately three years, American companies typically took four to six years. First, a full-scale clay model was built to see how the vehicle would look in real life. Incorporating changes to the model could take months. Once approved, single- or multipleprototype vehicles were built by hand to see whether parts fit together correctly and whether the car could be built economically. Engineers worked with the prototype builders to refine the engineering specifications. Once the prototype was ready, the engineers would design the individual components and the tooling needed to make the components. Then, purchasing agents would work with suppliers to produce prototype tooling and parts for assembly of pilot or preproduction vehicles. If everything went smoothly, the manufacturing-engineering team would then assemble the vehicle to discover any assembly problems. Finally, after additional modifications, the vehicle was mass produced.47 Today, all parties involved in designing a new platform or vehicle--designers, engineers, suppliers, and manufacturing and assembly personnel--work as part of a team, contributing to the process from beginning to end. As a result of computerization, steps that used to take weeks or months can now be done in a matter of days. Sharing information electronically allows the different members of the group to work on projects together, rather than having to wait for each member to finish his step before the next one can be taken. Through the use of computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and computer-aided engineering (CAE), the whole team can share computer files and use 3-D modeling techniques to design the vehicle and see how parts fit without building prototypes by hand. Changes to the components can be made without building sample tooling and parts. When the final design is agreed on, CAM data is loaded into machines that build the tooling and prototype parts. The same techniques are being used to reconfigure and retool assembly plants. Working as a team and sharing information electronically has cut the time it takes to develop and build a new vehicle to about 30 months.48 Automotive companies now want to shorten the design cycle to less than 24 months by setting up platform teams in different parts of the world and linking them electronically. By using global communication links, engineers in Detroit can assign a problem to engineers on their team in India. With the time zone difference, the engineers in the Far East can work on the problem and get an answer back to their Detroit counterparts by the next business day.49 Cycle times are also being shortened for production. Before the use of EDI, automotive companies communicated production requirements and schedules to their suppliers by phone, fax or mail. This meant time-consuming manual data entry, photocopying and information hand-offs 17   from one supplier to another. It could take several weeks to get the manufacturing schedule and requirements to all component factories and vendors. To minimize the impact of delays and errors caused by miscommunication, the assembly plant kept a large inventory of parts on-hand. Today, automobile manufacturers and their large suppliers communicate production and scheduling requirements via EDI. The assembly plant electronically sends the supplier an 8- to 12-week forecast or build plan. Daily production requirements detailing the number of parts needed at each plant at specific scheduled times are also communicated electronically. When the parts are ready and loaded in the trailer, the supplier notifies the assembly plant that the parts are on their way. The plant schedules its lines to coincide with the arrival of the trailers. By changing its assembly process to take advantage of the more accurate and timely information they receive electronically, most North American assembly locations turn inventory 130 times per year, up from 7 to 10 times per year in the past.50 In January 1994, Chrysler, Ford, GM, Johnson Controls and 12 of their suppliers began working together as part of the Manufacturing Assembly Pilot (MAP) to further improve material flow within a pilot four-tier seat assembly supply chain. At the project's outset, it took four to six weeks for material release information to reach the bottom of the supply chain. Along the way, information was distorted and truncated. The resulting late, inaccurate and untrusted information cost millions of dollars in the form of ""just-in-case"" inventories, premium freight, unplanned setups and changeovers, and other inefficiencies. By electronically connecting the MAP participants, production schedules reached the bottom of the supply chain in less than two weeks. On-time shipments improved 6 percent. Error rates were reduced by 72 percent. Up to eight hours per week per customer was saved in labor costs. Connecting all levels of suppliers through the entire industry via EDI could save nearly $1.1 billion annually--a cost savings of $71 or more per car--and decrease information lead-time to just one day between each tier of the supply chain.51 The automotive industry is now investing in a new venture, the Automotive Network Exchange (ANX), a managed ""virtual private network"" that runs over the Internet and links manufacturers and suppliers worldwide. ANX will electronically link those suppliers who still communicate to the automotive manufacturers by fax, phone and mail. And, it will replace the thousands of direct dial connections with a single network, considerably lowering the transmission costs borne by the manufacturers and the suppliers. Scheduled to be fully implemented by 2000, the network will electronically route product shipment schedules, CAD files for product designs, purchase orders, payments and other business information. Participating automobile manufacturers believe that ANX has the potential to reduce the product development and manufacturing cycles even further, as well as improve many other key business processes. The results achieved by the auto industry through EDI can be, and are being, replicated in many other industries. Because of its low cost and ease of use, the Internet will help accelerate the pace at which businesses communicate with each other electronically and the benefits they can realize. 18   MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE Companies are beginning to use the Internet for customer service. Having product descriptions, technical support and order status information online not only saves money by freeing up a company's own customer service staff to handle more complicated questions and manage customer relations, it can also lead to more satisfied customers. Companies have long gathered and stored information about customers and products in databases that only certain authorized employees can access. Innovative businesses are finding ways to tap the potential of that information, making it available to those who need it most--whether it's a customer service representative answering a phone call or a customer looking for account information or technical support online. Few things are more frustrating to a customer than uncertainty about when an important purchase will arrive. Too often, phone calls to a supplier result in a series of transfers from one department to another and an eventual promise to check on the status of the order and to call the customer back. This pattern consumes time and money for the customer and the seller. Delivery companies are helping their business partners solve this problem via the Internet. A customer can go to the company's Web site, enter his order number, and find out that the product is already on a FedEx or a UPS truck and is expected to arrive the next morning. This information can be retrieved from the company's Web site in less than a minute. In addition to improved customer satisfaction, companies using the Internet for customer service report savings from putting order tracking, software downloads and technical support information online. For instance, Cisco reports that its customer service productivity has increased by 200 to 300 percent, resulting in savings of $125 million in customer service costs. Dell estimates that it saves several million dollars a year by having basic customer service and technical support functions available on the Internet.  LOWER SALES AND MARKETING COSTS An individual sales person can support as many customer accounts as he can physically visit or contact by telephone. Therefore, as the number of accounts increases, so does the size of the sales force. Even direct marketing companies increase staffing as telephone order volume increases. By contrast, a Web business can add new customers with little or no additional cost. Because its sales function is housed in a computer server rather than physical store locations or sales people, its reach is bounded only by the capacity of the servers to respond to inquiries and orders. The Internet can also make traditional sales organizations, layered distribution channels, catalog sales and advertising more efficient. With automated ordering capabilities, sales representatives no longer have to prepare time-consuming manual orders. Instead, they can spend time building 19   and maintaining customer relationships. Electronic catalogs present far more information and options than their paper counterparts. Direct marketing online can shorten repurchase cycles and increase the ability to sell additional items. Some recent business examples suggest the potential of the Internet as an efficient sales tool. Boeing's spare parts business debuted its PART Page on the Internet in November 1996, allowing its airline customers around the world to check parts availability and pricing, order parts, and track the status of their orders. Less than a year later, about 50 percent of Boeing's customers use the Internet for 9 percent of all parts orders and a much larger percentage of customer service inquiries. The Boeing spare parts business processes about 20 percent more shipments per month in 1997 than it did in 1996 with the same number of data entry people. And, because customers can satisfy many service requests online, as many as 600 phone calls to customer service representatives are avoided each day. Cisco builds virtually all its products (routers, switches and other network interconnect devices) to order, so there are very few off-the-shelf products. Before the company established an Internet sales capability, ordering a product could be complicated. Generally, an engineer at the customer site knew what type of product was needed and how it should be configured. The engineer communicated this information to his procurement department who then created the purchase order and sent it to Cisco via fax, phone or e-mail. A Cisco customer service administrator entered the order into Cisco's system. If the order went through ""clean"", it would be booked and production scheduled within 24 hours. Nearly one out of four orders didn't get a ""clean"" bill of health, however. Instead, when Cisco's system tried to validate the order, it discovered an error in how the product was configured. The ""dirty"" order would be rejected, the customer contacted and the procurement cycle would begin again. In July 1996, Cisco rolled out its Web-based ordering and configuring system. Today, that same engineer can sit down at a PC, configure the product online, know immediately if there are any errors, and route the order to the procurement department. Because the customer's pricing structure is already programmed into the Cisco site, the authorized purchaser can complete the order with a few keystrokes. And, rather than calling Cisco to find out the status of the order, invoice or account information, a customer with the proper authorization can access the information directly on the Web site. With the online pricing and configuration tools, about 98 percent of the orders go through the system the first time, saving time both at Cisco and the customer's site. Lead times have dropped two to three days, and customers' productivity has increased an average of 20 percent per order.  NEW SALES OPPORTUNITIES The Internet operates around the clock and around the world. As a result, businesses on the Web can reach new markets they could not reach effectively with an in-person sales force or advertising campaigns. 20   For instance, a plastics commodity specialist at a large manufacturer can sit down at his PC, click on a Web browser and search for suppliers selling industrial plastics online. A small supplier with a limited sales force can now reach that buyer, getting its first introduction online. Similarly, a vendor's sales force may not be able to reach the millions of home offices and small offices around the country. By having an online presence and creating customized services for the small business market, that vendor may develop a new, lucrative market, both within the U.S. and globally. Companies using the Internet to sell products find that they attract new customers. For example, eighty percent of the consumers and half of the small businesses who purchased from Dell's Web site had never purchased from Dell before. One out of four say that if not for the Web site, they would not have made the purchase. And, their average purchase value is higher than Dell's typical customer. W.W. Grainger, the leading distributor of MRO supplies in North America, describes similar results. The company launched its Web business in the spring of 1995. Today, more than 30 percent of the company's online sales are to new customers or incremental sales to existing customers. Because the virtual store is open seven days a week, 24 hours a day, customers who wouldn't otherwise be able to order from a Grainger store are now able to do so. In fact, more than 50 percent of all orders are placed after 5 PM and before 7 AM when the local store is closed.  THE FUTURE Businesses that use the Internet to buy, sell, distribute and maintain products and services are realizing significant cost savings and increased sales opportunities. And, the benefits only increase as the network of businesses conducting electronic commerce grows. Investments are already taking place to realize the $300 billion in business-to-business Internet commerce analysts predict by 2002.52 Three of the companies discussed in this chapter--Cisco, Dell and General Electric--were responsible for about $3 billion in Internet commerce in 1997. If their current projections prove accurate, these three companies alone will conduct more than $17 billion in Internet commerce within three to five years.53 The experiences of these and other companies are quickly spreading through the rest of U.S. industry through conferences and consulting firms who assist companies to design and implement Internet-based business solutions. Even at $300 billion, Internet commerce will only represent 3 percent of total GDP.54 This means that the greater efficiencies companies are experiencing from electronic commerce are likely to continue to diffuse through the U.S. economy for decades to come. Meeting legal and technical hurdles Businesses have raised three potential inhibitors to the widespread adoption of Internet commerce: the lack of a predictable legal environment, concerns that governments will overtax the Internet, and uncertainty about the Internet's performance, reliability and security. 21   For a business to feel comfortable about using the Internet in communications with its suppliers and customers, it needs to be sure of the identity of the party at the other end of the transaction and that any agreement made electronically is binding. Today, a business verifies identities with passwords, electronic signatures and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Initiatives are currently underway to develop a more effective system of digital certification and authentication. The U.S. Government is promoting the development of an international convention to legally recognize digital authentication. The U.S. government also supports the development of both a domestic and global uniform commercial legal framework that will recognize, facilitate and enforce electronic transactions worldwide. Internationally, the U.S. government is working with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) which has completed work on a model law that supports the commercial use of international contracts in electronic commerce. The government is also encouraging the work of the International Chamber of Commerce which has issued model commercial code guidelines. Companies are also concerned about the potential for excessive taxation of the Internet. The U.S. Government believes that no new discriminatory taxes should be imposed on Internet commerce. It also believes that no customs duties should be imposed on electronic transmissions. The application of existing taxation on commerce conducted over the Internet should be consistent with the established principles of international taxation, should be neutral with respect to other forms of commerce, should avoid inconsistent national tax jurisdictions and double taxation, and should be simple to administer and easy to understand. Some companies express conduct EDI transactions information will arrive at network service provider concern about the Internet's current technical limitations. Those who over VANs have the confidence and experience that important its destination, on schedule, intact. If any problems do arise, a single is accountable and responsible for resolving them.  Companies expecting this level of service worry that the Internet offers no such guarantees. Because it is a public network that connects many smaller, interconnected networks and service providers, there is no single entity responsible for ensuring that a message leaves one point and arrives, intact, at another. And, because companies have a need to transmit confidential information, they want assurance that it remains secure. Companies are taking different approaches to address the current technical limitations. Some use the Internet to purchase lower-value, indirect materials while keeping their higher-value, direct material purchases over VANs. Some rely on extranets, or ""virtual private networks,"" that limit access to a certain pre-qualified set of businesses and their partners. Sophisticated encryption products and firewalls are being used by some companies to protect privacy and ensure the security of Internet transactions. Many others await a resolution of current export limitations on encryption software before they plan to increase their Internet business. 22   The automotive industry's ANX is an example of an extranet that will provide automotive trading partners with a single, secure network for electronic commerce and data transfer. The industry has created a management structure and business rules to ensure that the network meets the performance, reliability and security requirements the industry has put forward. The ANX Overseer, Bellcore, has direct operations and management responsibilities over the network. Participating Internet Service Providers and Network Exchange Points have been certified and will operate according to the terms of the ANX. A common set of business practices, including ""acceptable use"" policies and common network level security methods are additional conditions of participation in the ANX. Businesses will pursue alternatives most suitable for their immediate business requirements. For some, standard off-the-shelf solutions running over the public Internet are satisfactory. For others, customized solutions--along with explicit rules and operating procedures--may be the answer. As the Internet's performance and reliability improves over time, and as predictable legal frameworks emerge, the growth of business-to-business electronic commerce will accelerate.  23   CHAPTER FOUR: DIGITAL DELIVERY OF GOODS AND SERVICES  Software, CDs, magazine articles, news broadcasts, stocks, airline tickets and insurance policies are all intangible goods whose value does not rely on a physical form. Much of today's intellectual property is produced, packaged, stored somewhere and then physically delivered to its final destination. The technology exists (or soon will exist) to transfer the content of these products in digital form over the Internet.  CONTENT News from around the world is now available on the Internet, usually free of charge. More than 2,700 newspapers have online businesses, of which over 60 percent are U.S.-based.55 All but three of the top 50 magazines in the country (as defined by paid circulation) had a Web presence as of January 1998.56 More than 800 TV stations across the U.S. have Web sites.57 UltimateTV.com lists 151 U.S. cable channels including CNN, fX, HBO, MTV, the Weather Channel and a host of others.58 AudioNet calls itself the leader in Internet broadcasting, with live continuous broadcasts of over 175 radio and television stations, play-by-play of thousands of college and professional sporting events, live music, on-demand music from the CD Jukebox (over 1,600 full-length CDs), live and on-demand shows and Internet-only Webcasts and live and on-demand corporate and special events. The rapid emergence of information services on the Internet is being driven by consumer demand, more effective distribution, and an expected shift in advertising revenues away from traditional media to the Internet.  Consumer Demand Nearly 90 percent of Web users go online to get news and information.59 There, they can find obscure or limited circulation journals online as well as the top sellers. Articles limited to text and perhaps a picture in a print edition may be supplemented in the online version with video or audio clips, maps or in-depth background research. Still somewhat difficult to navigate, the Internet's wide selection of content sites save individuals time when conducting research, and yield much more complete and up-to-date information than offline alternatives. As technology advances and search tools become easier to use, individuals can be expected to increasingly turn to the Internet's content sites to do research, to learn about the day's news, and to be entertained.  24   How quickly individuals change their behavior in favor of the Internet, and away from other media, is difficult to determine. Recent studies indicate that as use of the Internet increases, television viewing declines.60 However, some of today's Web businesses point out that circulation for their existing newspapers and magazines has not dropped, even while their Web audiences increase. They state that some in the online audience are also found among their most loyal print readers, but look to each medium to satisfy different purposes. For instance, Business Week reports that visitors to its Web site read the front page article and then use the site to research the magazine's archives and special report sections, features they do not have in the print version. It may take a number of years before the impact is felt. For instance, McGraw-Hill's financial information services division began to distribute its products electronically over ten years ago. Up until three years ago, print revenues made up 85 percent of the division's sales. Today, digital products account for more than 50 percent of sales. Lower Capital and Distribution Costs The New York Times invested $350 million in its new printing press. Readers can now see frontpage photos in color instead of black and white. Readers accessing the New York Times on the Web not only see color photos from the print version's front page, they get radio clips, color spreads on special feature sections for the Web only, and the chance to interact with other New York Times readers interested in the day's or week's hot topics. Web content businesses require a much lower capital investment than their print counterparts, lowering the barrier to entry in this online industry. With the Internet, the content of a newspaper or a magazine does not have to be printed and delivered to news stands or doorsteps across the city in order to be consumed--steps that add 30 to 40 percent to the cost of the product. Instead, content delivered via the Internet can be entered directly into a computer, stored digitally on a server and appear directly on a reader's computer screen with a few simple commands the reader enters on the Web site. The consumer can then read the information on the screen or print it out. The publisher's distribution costs include paying off the investment in the Web servers and other technology that ensures that when someone enters the site, it responds quickly. Unlike newspaper or magazine content that gets used once, digitally-stored content offers the potential for repeated repackaging and reuse. Once the content has been created and stored, there is little or no extra cost to send it to one reader or 1,000 readers. That increases the efficiency of the newspaper and magazine businesses dramatically. However, simply establishing a presence on the Internet does not guarantee that a business will succeed. Building brand awareness through advertising and marketing is critical to success in a new and rapidly evolving market, particularly on the Internet where consumers have the choice of spending their time and money at thousands of different sites. If the Internet evolves in such a way that a limited number of sites become the ""funnel"" that guides a viewer through its vast content, businesses looking to appeal to mass audiences may have to pay large fees to secure ""shelf space"" on those sites. Or, they may be excluded altogether. In this scenario, advertising 25   and marketing costs may become too expensive for some to bear. If, on the other hand, technology and consumer preference evolves so that consumers access and navigate the Internet using a variety of devices and tools (perhaps personal software ""agents""), then high rents might be avoided. Statistics on Web traffic indicate that the ""funnel"" model is winning out today. Over time, as people begin to access the Web via their TVs, telephones and personal digital assistants, and as the Web becomes easier to navigate, this may change and lower advertising and marketing costs may result.  Shift of revenue sources to the Internet Even with their lower costs of operation, content businesses on the Web do not yet generate adequate revenues. Unlike newspapers and magazines that rely on subscriptions for some of their revenue, most Web businesses currently shy away from charging subscriptions in favor of building an audience and attracting advertising and direct marketing/transactions revenues. Though growing, these revenue sources are still small. At this early stage of development, it is unclear how quickly Internet content businesses will draw readers or viewers away from traditional media sources such as newspapers, magazines and television. As it happens, advertising and subscription revenues flowing to the Internet are likely to increase. Even if the total audience for a newspaper or a TV sitcom does not decline, advertisers may shift spending to the Internet if they feel that it provides a more effective means to reach their audiences. Current trends in classified and local advertising spending indicate a shift already taking place. Newspapers have been watching their share of classified advertising dollars shrink as real estate agents, car dealers and owners, and businesses looking to hire employees increase their advertising in niche publications, direct mail and online services. A 1996 Newspaper Association of America study points out that newspaper publishers could lose as much as 50 percent of their classified ad dollars in the next five years if current trends continue. If that happens, the average newspaper's operating margin, now 14 percent, would drop to 3 percent.61 To maintain revenues from classifieds and to attract local advertising dollars, newspapers have been quick to establish Web sites featuring classified ads and city guides. Other industries are also seeking a share of classified and local advertising revenues. Software companies, telephone companies, Internet service providers, television networks and newspapers are gearing up to compete for a share of this potentially large market. A New York-based research firm, Find/SVP, reported that more than 60 corporations ranging from Warner Brothers and PacTel to NBC and U.S. West have launched, or are in the process of organizing, Web sites with a strong emphasis on local content.62  26   Software companies and search engines feature city guides listing movies and restaurants, arts and music, current events, places to go, local sports, weather and news. Some broadcast and cable networks combine coverage of national news and entertainment with local news from affiliates and searchable databases of online classified ads. Directory listings and mapping services partner with newspapers, software companies and others to offer their own city guides. Telephone companies have their own directory listings and mapping services and are partnering with others for real estate listings, restaurant guides, and other local information and services. Analysts project significant growth in revenues available for online content businesses. Forrester Research predicts that revenues from advertising, subscriptions and transactions fees will grow to $8.5 billion within five years,63 or almost 5 percent of the $175 billion advertisers spent in newspapers, TV, radio, direct mail, billboards, and other traditional media in 1996.64  TRAVEL Vacationers and business travelers can now find information on the Internet about cities they plan to visit, from driving directions and recommended itineraries to weather patterns and business telephone numbers and addresses. Many hotels have detailed property descriptions, along with photos of the property's grounds, public rooms and bedrooms. Rental cars can be reserved online. Top travel magazines offer online suggestions for the best week-end getaways. The largest initial online travel business is the sale of airline tickets. Web-based travel services offer the reservations engines that airline customer service representatives and travel agents use directly to leisure and business travelers. Customers enter point-to-point destinations, desired travel times and dates, preferred airlines, and other preferences into the reservation system. The system processes the information and delivers a choice of options, along with a secure transactions environment for customers who wish to purchase the ticket online. In 1996, Web users booked $276 million worth of travel this way. For 1997, online travel sales are estimated to have reached $816 million. By the year 2000, online travel sales could reach $5 billion,65 or close to 7 percent of U.S. airlines' revenues for passenger air travel.66 According to a survey released in November 1997 by the Travel Industry Association of America, 13.8 million Americans used the Internet to plan their trips and 6.3 million made reservations on the Internet. And, consumer acceptance is growing. In 1996, 10 percent of Internet users used the Internet to make travel plans and purchases. When polled in 1997, nearly 70 percent of Internet users said they planned to use the Internet for travel in the upcoming year. Acceptance is high among the general population, as well. Thirty-eight percent of all adults said they would consider using the Internet for their travel in 1998. Lower sales and marketing costs, and increased consumer choice and convenience are driving the Internet's increased use in travel planning and reservations.  27   Lower sales and marketing costs It is cheaper for an airline to process a ticket sale online than to use a travel agent or a reservations center. Not only are transaction fees reduced, but savings are also realized when cheaper electronic tickets can be substituted for more expensive paper tickets. Through the use of the Internet and other information technology, airlines expect to be able to significantly cut distribution costs. At $12 billion, distribution--travel agent commissions, marketing and advertising expenses, labor and other expenses for airline central reservations services--is the airline industry's second largest operating expense.67 Figure 7. Cost to Process Airline Tickets $8.00: Travel agent books, using computer reservation system $6.00: Travel agent books direct with airline $1.00: Customer books ""electronic ticket"" direct with airline Source: Air Transport Association of America, 11/20/97  How a ticket is sold, through an agent or by the airline directly, and whether the ticket is paper or electronic, can mean the difference between paying $8.00 or $1.00 to process a ticket (Figure 7).68  Airlines are pursuing various strategies to drive their distribution costs down: lowering travel agent commissions, selling through the Internet and promoting electronic ticketing. Southwest Airlines was the first major U.S. airline to let passengers buy tickets directly on their Internet site in 1996, bypassing the agent and the commission. New Web travel services quickly emerged: online travel sites sponsored by airlines themselves, ""virtual"" travel agents like Microsoft's Expedia.com and The SABRE Group's Travelocity.com, and travel agents' own sites. Whether customers purchase tickets on an airline's site or through online travel agents, the airlines save money since their own travel reservations centers do not have to be involved in the purchase. In addition, the commissions they pay to online agents are about half what they pay to traditional agents.69 While the airlines' ability to move customers away from paper tickets to lower-cost electronic tickets does not depend on the Internet, it is proving to be a useful vehicle for accelerating the shift. Some airlines encourage their Internet customers to use electronic tickets by offering frequent flyer miles for travel booked online with an electronic ticket. Because Internet customers reserve their tickets, select seats and give credit card information online, getting an electronic ticket rather than a paper one seems natural. Airlines also use the Web to generate additional revenues. No matter how precise an airline's forecasting, seats still go unsold on some flights. Auctioning airline seats to the highest bidder and offering special ""cyberfares"" for leisure travel are two techniques made possible by the Internet. 28   Every Monday or Tuesday, American Airlines looks at its yield management results and picks out low-performing markets. Midweek, more than one million ""NetSAAver"" subscribers receive an e-mail from American Airlines listing special discounted fares for travel in selected markets during the upcoming weekend. The NetSAAver program has generated tens of millions of incremental dollars for the airline since its launch in March 1996.  RETAIL BANKING Internet banking is still in its infancy. Although most of the top 100 banks in the U.S. have a Web site, the Online Banking Report classifies 24 of them as ""True Internet Banks""--banks that let their customers review balances, transfer funds and pay bills on their Web sites. Smaller banks also have Web presences. In Online Banking's list of 133 ""True Internet Banks,"" 109 do not make the list of the top 100 U.S. banks ranked by assets.70 Before the decade is out, customers are likely to be able to do most of their banking transactions on the Web. According to a 1996 Booz-Allen & Hamilton survey of North American financial institutions with Web sites, 80 percent of respondents planned to allow their customers to conduct most traditional banking transactions over the Internet within three years.71 Online retail banking is being driven by lower operating costs, the ability to offer new services, and the ability to do one-to-one marketing.  Lower operating costs Online banking services are less expensive to offer to customers than other forms of banking. Checking an account balance or transferring funds from a checking account to a savings account can be done in person at a branch bank, over the telephone, with an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM), at home using a PC, or, in some cases, on a bank's Web site. A branch bank can serve as many customers as it has staff to handle. Once the investment is made to create a fully functioning Internet site (for a  Figure 8. Internet Banking is Cheaper for Banks  1.2 1.07  1 Cost per Transaction ($) 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.27  0.52  0.2 0 0.01 0.015  Internet  PC Banking  ATM  Telephone  Branch  Source: Booz-Allen & Hamilton  29   large bank, the initial investment could be millions of dollars; a more limited solution for a small bank might cost tens of thousands of dollars), the bank's Web site can handle one customer inquiry or tens of thousands a day. Booz-Allen & Hamilton estimates that it costs about a penny to conduct a banking transaction using the Internet and more than one dollar if handled by a teller at a branch bank (Figure 8).72 New Services Today's online banking allows customers to check account balances, transfer funds, and update customer information--transactions that can already be performed through traditional banking channels. For some customers, the convenience of banking from home or the office is preferable to calling the bank's automated phone service or going to a branch bank. Others do not find the services offered online today reason enough to change their banking habits. In the future, analysts expect that Internet banking will be enhanced with new services that make online banking easier and more convenient than banking by ATM, by phone, or visiting the branch bank. Paying bills electronically is one such example. Checks are the preferred method of bill payment in the United States.73 For a business, preparing and sending paper bills can be costly. For a consumer, paying bills by check can take a great deal of time. Billers print out and mail the bills to a consumer's home. The consumer writes a check, records the check number and amount paid, balances the checkbook, finds a stamp and mails the check back to the biller. The biller receives the check, updates his accounts and sends the check to the bank to credit to his account. Handling paper bills and checks can cost a biller between $1.65 and $2.70 each time he sends out a bill.74 It costs the customer time and the price of a stamp to pay each bill. Today's Internet-based bill payment services take some of the paperwork out of the process. Rather than writing a paper check and mailing it to the vendor, a customer authorizes his bank to pay bills on his behalf. This saves the customer some time, and may save the vendor some money, if all steps are completed electronically. However, vendors still incur the costs of mailing the bill to the customer. And, smaller vendors without an electronic connection still have a series of manual and paper-based steps to complete. Some banks believe that future Web-based bill payment services can make the entire process paperless. The vendor will send an electronic image of the bill to the customer's bank. The customer will electronically authorize the bank to pay the bill, the bank will debit the customer's account, and the vendor will receive payment electronically. The vendor's printing and mailing costs are eliminated, and processing costs are greatly reduced. The customer enjoys the convenience of paying bills without having to keep stamps and envelopes on hand. With services that automatically update account balances, the customer also saves time he formerly spent balancing his checkbook.  30   One-to-one Marketing Today, most banks are still equipping their Web sites with basic transactions processing and do little with tailored or one-to-one marketing. However, some now realize that through the Internet, a bank can get to know a customer's banking priorities and preferences even better than it could when banking was done in small neighborhood branches. Bank of America's ""Build Your Own Bank"" provides an example of how one-to-one marketing could work. Internet customers using this service provide the bank with basic information about their place of residence, occupation, age, income and gender, whether they own or rent a home, and what types of accounts they have with the bank. They then indicate their financial interests and priorities--whether saving and investing, home buying/improvement, building a business, retirement, economic and financial markets, electronic commerce, or simply better financial organization and budgeting. Based on these inputs, the bank responds with Money Tips and news items geared to the customer's interests, and special offers for the services the customer has prioritized. These and similar mechanisms give banks the opportunity to cross-sell products and services. Ideally, the customer benefits from these tailored offerings, as well. At a minimum, he should benefit from greater convenience. Because his account profile automatically gets called up when the customer logs into a personalized site, he wastes no time entering account information. Having up-to-date information about balances in each account gives the customer a snapshot of his holdings with the bank without having to do the math himself. The personalized tips and special offers may help the customer to make important financial decisions.  The Future Over the next few years, a growing number of American households are expected to do their banking online--whether through a dial-up connection to their bank or through the Internet. Roughly 4.5 million households were banking online in 1997. By the year 2000, as many as 16 million households are expected to bank online.75  INSURANCE Insurance carriers' Web sites typically provide customers with basic corporate and policy information, but refer customers to offline agents or customer service phone representatives in order to make a purchase. A more limited number of carriers' sites, and other sites, including banks, securities brokerages, real estate companies and automobile marketplaces, allow Internet customers to purchase term life, automobile and homeowners' insurance online.  31   Table 4. Internet Sales of Personal Insurance Projected to Grow 1997 $21 M $17 M $1.1 M $39.1 M 2001 $850 $108 $152 $1.1 By 2001, analysts project that more than $1 billion in premiums will be generated via the Internet (Table 4).76 The rapid increase in sales will be driven by cost savings, increased competition and growing consumer acceptance.  Auto Term life Homeowner Total  M M M B  Source: Forrester Research  Cost savings Distribution costs for life and property and casualty policies can be as high as 33 percent or more of the product's price.77 Selling policies and providing customer service over the Internet is much less expensive than via an agent or a telephone representative--as much as 58-71 percent lower over the lifetime of a customer.78 In a direct online sale by the carrier, the agent commission is avoided. If the sale is completed by an online agent such as Quicken InsureMarket, it can be more than cut in half. Even if a traditional agent completes the transaction started on the Internet, the transaction is less expensive. The Internet prequalifies the customer for the agent, saving sales time and expense. The Internet can also be used for electronic communication between agents and carriers, reducing time spent on routine tasks such as applications processing, updating customer account information, and reporting on the status of claims. In addition to saving money, the Internet can generate new sales opportunities. Carriers that traditionally sell through agents may pick up new customers on the Internet that agents cannot effectively reach. Because of the time needed to acquire a new customer, agents tend to focus on clients they believe will buy larger policies. One insurer, Lincoln Benefit Life, reports differences in the face value of the policies it sells via the Internet and through independent agents. The majority of policies sold by an agent have face values of $500,000 or greater. Online, Lincoln reaches customers who wish to purchase policies with face values of $500,000 and under.  Increased competition Banks and securities brokerages have begun to sell insurance in their aim to be the one-stop shop for consumers' financial services needs. Whether through alliances with insurers or in direct competition with them, these new entrants will affect how insurers go to market. At the moment, both banks and securities brokerages are embracing the Internet more rapidly than insurers.  32   Growing consumer demand Surveys indicate that people would like to be able to get quotes, pay premiums and update their policies online--functions that are not yet provided on most insurance carriers' sites today. Insurance executives believe that within five years, their customers will prefer to receive auto and term life policies online to purchasing from an agent. They will get product information and quotes, pay premiums, compare prices, access their access and update their policy information, and get advice from financial service purchase and use the Web to claims status, experts.79  THE FUTURE Most industry watchers predict that the market for the digital delivery of products and services will evolve quickly. The rate varies considerably by industry, however. Selling travel online appears to have the fewest constraints, perhaps because computer reservations systems have been in place for years. Analysts predict rapid growth in travel services, from less than $1 billion in 1997 to close to $8 billion within three to five years.80 Similarly, the financial services area is poised for quick growth. Nearly 5 million people actively trade stocks online and pay $8 - $30 per trade (traditional brokerages charge an average of $80 per trade).81 Investment bank Piper Jaffrey estimates that $614 million in broker commissions were generated online in 1997. This represents more than 4 percent of total retail brokerage commissions and 29 percent of the $2.1 billion in commissions attributable to the discount brokerage sector.82 Analysts predict that 10-16 million households will bank online by 2000, more than double the number in 1997.83 Internet-generated premiums for insurance are expected to grow from $39 million in 1997 to $1.1 billion by 2001.84 Other digital products and services have significant growth potential, but their long-term success is tied to solutions for protecting copyrights and to improvements in the Internet infrastructure. Intellectual property holders--software developers, recording artists and record companies, movie studios, authors and publishers--worry that digital copies sold or transmitted over the Internet may be prone to copyright infringement and piracy. The Internet is a natural, low-cost distribution channel for these digital products, but the uncertainty of whether their products can be protected impedes growth. Companies are working with technological solutions such as ""watermarks"" and ""digital object identifiers"" so that they can keep track of their products online. In December 1996, governments negotiated treaties at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to address the question of how copyright should be recognized and protected in global Internet commerce. The U.S. government is working to have these treaties ratified in the U.S. and around the world.  33   For the multimedia industry, the question of bandwidth is crucial. Until Web users can download a video in a matter or seconds, Web sites will not create many video products to sell online and Web users will prefer to read text, watch television or use their VCR. Increased bandwidth will also benefit education and health care services. Educational services will be able to use more video programming to supplement other online resources. The Web can also be a very useful tool in medical education and for the delivery of health care diagnostic services. Today's Web users can access some information from their health plans and physicians about medical conditions, symptoms and suggested treatments. Increasingly, they will be able to schedule appointments, pay bills, and check the status of their claims online. As new equipment is developed for remote diagnosis, doctors will be able to diagnose some medical conditions and recommend treatments to patients via the Internet (state laws and regulations regarding telemedicine and licensure may limit how widely remote diagnosis is used). However, because some medical diagnostics require very high-quality images (poor resolution could give the impression of a tumor or a fracture where none exists, for instance), improvements in bandwidth, image quality and reliability will need to occur before telemedicine and remote medical diagnostics emerge as viable industries on the Internet.  34   CHAPTER FIVE: RETAIL SALE OF TANGIBLE GOODS  In addition to goods and services that can be delivered electronically, the Internet is also used to sell physical goods. Increasing demands on leisure time and the improvement of overnight and second-day delivery services that spurred the growth of catalog shopping in the 1980s and 1990s are now leading people to shop over the Internet. A fall/winter 1997 CommerceNet/Nielsen study found that 10 million Web users in the U.S. and Canada (about 16 percent of all Internet users in North America) have actually purchased something on the Web, up from 7.4 million six months earlier. A much larger number use the Web to shop, but they still close the transaction over the telephone or at a store.85 Internet consumers report that they shop on the Web because of convenience, ease of research and good prices.86 Where most Internet shoppers bought computer software and hardware a year ago, today's shoppers buy more mainstream items. America Online (AOL), the largest Internet Service Provider with 11 million customers, reported a shift in online buying patterns during the 1997 holiday season. Apparel climbed to the top spot, and books, to third place this year. Also popular were food, flowers, music and toys.87 Internet retailers pursue a variety of strategies to attract customers. Just as one would find in traditional retailing, specialty retailers, large discounters and malls/marketplaces have their places online. Internet consumers may also visit online auction houses or use a ""personal agent"" to help with their shopping. Most Internet stores try to make online shopping as familiar and as easy as possible. Physical products arranged on store shelves are replaced with electronic catalogs that include photographs, detailed product descriptions, pricing and size information. Third-party reviews may be available to assist the buyer in choosing between different brands or models. When ready to make a purchase, the customer clicks on the product and puts it into a virtual ""shopping cart,"" and may continue shopping or proceed directly to check out. First-time customers enter basic name and address information, along with a credit card, hit the enter key on the computer, and the transaction is completed. Recognizing that customers may want to speak with a company representative directly in some instances, many Internet retail sites offer toll-free customer service numbers. Just as traditional bookstores feature tables of bestsellers and gift books, and organize racks of books by subject area, Internet bookstores also provide guides through their vast virtual selection. For those who know the title or the author of the book, a keyword search scans the entire inventory in a matter of moments, retrieves the title, along with a brief description and review of the book, and a button to add it to the customer's shopping cart. Visitors may also browse for a 35   book according to topic. The topic can be as broadly defined as ""history"" or as narrowly defined as ""Civil War."" At the same time they borrow from concepts familiar to traditional retail, Internet merchants do not think that merely duplicating what can be found offline is enough to convince customers to shop online. Early pioneers of Internet retail talk about attracting customers with additional value, selection and entertainment. The Cendant Corporation, a $5.3 billion consumer goods and services company, sells over one million products and services on its Web site, from cars to electronics and cameras, books, appliances, luggage, perfume, flowers and gifts, computer hardware and software, video games and a variety of other goods and services. For an annual membership fee of $69, Cendant claims that its netMarket Web site satisfies 20 percent of the average family's shopping needs. Because the company's business model relies almost entirely on membership fees, Cendant reports that it sells products to retail customers at, or near, wholesale prices. In 1997, Cendant facilitated the sale of more than $1.2 billion worth of products and services over the Internet. Before the decade comes to a close, the company plans to offer a product selection which will cover 95 percent of the products a typical household would buy. Internet Shopping Network's First Auction site aims to attract Internet users looking for adventure, entertainment, and seeking a bargain. People from all over the country bid against each other in real-time to ""win"" products. First Auction starts many of its bids at $1.00, well below a product's cost. Bidders quickly bid up the price, competing with each other to take possession of golf clubs, CD players, television sets, jewelry and a range of other items. Launched in July 1997, First Auction's membership roster approached 100,000 people by the end of 1997, and 30,00 people visited the site each day. An Internet shopper need not go to a ""store"" in order to buy something. In fact, the concept of retail is blurring. Some media sites, online service providers and search engines prominently feature retailers and provide direct links to their sites. Some give customers the ability to buy goods directly from their own sites. Time Warner, the media and entertainment company, has a marketplace on its Web site featuring retailers selling books, music, travel, computers and electronics, vitamins and more. Visitors using Yahoo!'s search engine can buy products from The Visa Shopping Guide by Yahoo!. A shopper who wants to buy a pair of ladies' shoes, but does not want to go from Web store to Web store to shop, can use the ""one search"" option and a software agent scans the offerings of participating retailers for selection and price information in one trip. An interested buyer can click on the ""buy"" button and be transported to the Web page featuring a picture and a more detailed description of the shoes at the retailer's site to finish the transaction. Even buying a car, more of an investment than a typical retail purchase, is possible to do through a number of auto marketplaces, online classified sites, and manufacturers' own sites. JD Power & Associates, a marketing information firm specializing in the automotive industry, estimates that roughly 16 percent of all new car and truck buyers used the Internet as part of their shopping 36   process in 1997, up from 10 percent in 1996. By 2000, they project that the Internet will be used in at least 21 percent of all new car and truck purchases.88 As in other areas, the growth of online retailing is being driven by cost savings, the ability to customize marketing, and increased consumer convenience. Virtual stores report lower operating costs than their physical counterparts. Costs of supporting a store infrastructure--rent and depreciation, labor, utilities and other expenses - - are almost entirely avoided online. 1-800-FLOWERS sells flowers through its own flower shops, affiliated flower shops in major cities across the country, by telephone sales and online. Although its online business generates only 10 percent of its total revenues, its profit contribution to the overall business is nearly that of its store-based business which generates 20 percent of total revenues.89 Direct marketing in traditional retail is already quite sophisticated: retailers can access and manipulate extensive databases made up of warranty information for cars, appliances and consumer electronics. Retailers can use this information to attract new customers by sending mailings to consumers living in certain zip codes that fit given demographic or other specialized profiles. Databases of existing customers may be even more detailed, allowing retailers to send more targeted offers. In either case, these direct mailings often take time and significant expense to compile, mail and then review their effectiveness. Though not really in practice yet, the Internet offers the opportunity to take direct marketing to the next level: to market directly to narrow bands of customers--even to individuals--and to do so profitably. When a customer visits a site, for example, the site may say ""hello"" and state the visitor's name. It knows who is there because of a technology that records the Internet address of the visitor and matches it to a name if the visitor has already registered or purchased something at the site. Web businesses also keep track of what an individual customer purchases. Increasingly, Web businesses will send a message to the buyer of a 28.8 kbps modem that the company now offers the latest 56 kbps modem; the person who buys a certain style and size of pants and sweaters will receive notices of new merchandise in that style or size, along with suggestions for accessories to match; the adventure traveler whose last trip was to Nepal at the height of trekking season may receive information about the newest hiking boots and multi-day packs to hit the market or an invitation to join a team traveling to Patagonia. Right now, many consumers are wary of this type of marketing, fearing a loss of personal privacy. If Web users become convinced that they can protect their privacy online at the same time they make these offers, targeted marketing will likely become commonplace. Amazon.com has taken some first steps in this direction. It greets site visitors by name, informs customers by e-mail when a particular book has arrived or sends them reviews of ""best new books"" in areas where the customer has indicated an interest. An ""instant recommendations"" feature proposes books to customers based on purchases they have made at Amazon. Customers can also get an accounting of their purchases at Amazon or see the status of their orders. 37   THE FUTURE Analysts believe that Internet retailing (where sales are actually completed on the Internet) will grow quickly, but they vary widely on just how quickly. On the conservative end, it is expected to reach $7 billion by the year 2000.90 If mail order sales are used to determine the potential for Web retail sales, as some suggest, the figure could reach $115 billion in five to eight years.91 If online shopping provides customers with a larger assortment, better prices, and greater choice than mail order companies, the figure may even exceed that projection. To make the most of the potential of the Internet, retailers will have to overcome a number of challenges. Among others, they will need to increase consumer confidence in relying on computer images and information to determine the quality and fit of a product, and simplify the process of returning defective or unwanted merchandise. They will also need to address the question of credit card security and consumer privacy.  Making Virtual Purchases More ""Real"" How can virtual images on the Internet replicate the sensation of picking up a product, feeling the material and its texture or sturdiness, trying it on (in the case of clothing) or sitting down on it (in the case of a sofa) before making the decision to buy? As described earlier, Internet retailers offer very detailed product descriptions online. Many provide toll-free numbers for customers who prefer to speak with a sales representative before making a purchase. As video and voice become more widely used, some Internet sites can be expected to give customers the choice to click on a button and speak directly with a customer service or sales representative via the Internet. As bandwidth increases, three-dimensional images that show the product from a variety of angles will supplement or replace the flat photos on most sites today. Customers visiting Internet furniture stores will be able to furnish their own homes and apartments by ""dragging and dropping"" furniture and accessory icons into rooms the customer has made to resemble those in his home. This feature will enable customers to gauge how well different pieces of furniture fit into a room of a given size, and which furniture styles or colors work best together. How well will Internet retailers satisfy demands, particularly in the U.S., for immediate gratification, no-fuss returns, and a strong customer service policy? Customers are generally interested in speed of delivery and ease of return. The emergence of extensive overnight shipping in many parts of the world already allows retailers--including those on the Internet--to provide quick, reliable service. As Web retailing increases, overnight delivery and ""drop shipping"" services from manufacturers to the customer's home are likely to grow as well. Customers who worry that they will have to make an extra trip to the post office or parcel delivery company if a product they order via the Internet is not what they had in mind may be surprised to learn that some companies will actually send packaging overnight, free of charge, 38   to a customer's home, along with instructions to return the product, free of charge, to the company.  Making transactions secure Most Internet purchases are currently made by entering credit card and delivery information on a computerized form and transmitting it electronically to the retailer. Even though consumers are accustomed to giving credit card information over the telephone, many are reluctant to give it online for fear that it will be stolen or misused. This reluctance is often cited as the largest barrier to the growth of retail sales on the Internet. Web retailers believe that concerns about credit card security will lessen, particularly as more people shop online, have trouble-free experiences, and tell their friends and relatives about them. In fact, some already detect greater comfort among their consumers this year as compared to one year ago. (1-800-FLOWERS recently reported that fewer than one-third of its customers worry about credit card security, compared to almost 75 percent in 1996.92) Word of mouth, combined with technology and standards for safeguarding sensitive information, should help to alleviate these concerns. Smart cards and digital cash will also be used for electronic commerce. Instead of reentering name, address and credit card information each time a purchase is made at a different Web site, information already stored on the smart card will be transmitted to the merchant electronically, saving steps for the consumer and reducing fraud by automatically validating the consumer's identity. For those consumers who wish to purchase goods or services anonymously, digital cash and stored value cards (cards worth a set amount of money) will also be available at banks and other companies for use over the network.  Ensuring Privacy of Personal Information Consumers worry about protecting the privacy of their personal information, as well. A majority of respondents to a recent Business Week/Harris poll mentioned privacy as the main reason they do not use the Internet. More than three-quarters of current users say they would use the Web more if privacy were guaranteed.93 Some sites request that new visitors volunteer personal information upon entering the site. In exchange for that information, they may offer ""membership"" services such as birthday reminder emails, new product announcements or newsletters. A purchase may trigger the gathering and creation of a customer profile, as Internet retailers need basic personal information in order to deliver a physical good to a customer. Or, an Internet user may leave an electronic ""footprint"" of visits to different Web sites and purchases he has made and not even be aware of doing so.  39   Often today, consumers are not given the opportunity to block the gathering of information or, when they freely give it, to indicate how they would like that information to be used (for instance, whether the company should restrict its use to internal purposes, whether it can be disseminated to external companies if specific conditions are met, or whether it can be widely disseminated). Some realize that their information has been sold without their knowledge or consent when they receive unwanted e-mail. Some may see the positive side to data collection and direct marketing the next time they go to buy a book and are presented with suggestions of new releases in keeping with their interests and past purchases. Nevertheless, they want some control over when and how their data are collected and used. In order to empower consumers to have control of their own personal information, the U.S. government is encouraging the private sector to establish codes of conduct and self-regulation. To be meaningful, the government believes that self-regulation must do more than articulate broad policies or guidelines. Effective self-regulation involves substantive rules, as well as the means to ensure that consumers know the rules, that companies comply with them, and that consumers have appropriate recourse when there is noncompliance. Consumers need to know the identity of the collector of their personal information, the intended uses of the information, and the means by which they may limit its disclosure. They should be given the opportunity to exercise choice with respect to whether and how their personal information is used. Companies creating, maintaining, using or disseminating records of identifiable personal information must take reasonable measures to assure its reliability for its intended use and must take reasonable precautions to protect it from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. In addition, consumers should have the opportunity for reasonable, appropriate access to information about them that a company holds, and be able to correct or amend that information when necessary.  Consumer retail on the Internet is already showing signs of rapid growth. As retailers address the challenges outlined above and as consumers become more familiar and comfortable with buying goods online, the Internet could emerge as an important retail channel.  40   CHAPTER SIX: CONSUMERS IN THE DIGITAL AGE  Businesses invest in information technology and electronic commerce to increase productivity, cut costs and enhance customer service. Consumers shop on the Internet because they find their choices dramatically increased. They have access to much more information when making purchasing decisions. Busy consumers can save time and find shopping more convenient as merchants serve their needs individually. Better information and greater selection, combined with lower operating costs for many Internet business may, in turn, drive reductions in prices or improvements in quality.  CHOICE The sheer number of stores that can be ""visited"" online far exceeds even the most densely populated retail areas in the country. No longer do customers find their shopping limited to the stores within a reasonable driving or walking distance or to the catalogues they receive in the mail. Online, customers can shop at stores in other states, in other countries, and at stores that do not exist in traditional formats. News and newspapers provide a vivid example. Residents of large cities already benefit by being able to buy a number of different national and regional newspapers from coin-operated machines and specialty news outlets. Outside large cities, however, the selection is much more limited. Online, readers can access news from thousands of newspapers around the world. An online reader interested in news about the 1998 winter Olympics in Nagano can access coverage in Japan's Asahi Shimbun as well as turning to coverage in the American media. The vast selection is not limited to products and services that can be delivered digitally. Web sites selling consumer electronics, gardening supplies, office supplies and other hard goods also offer larger selections than do their counterparts in traditional retail. The largest chain bookstores carry about 150,000 different books. On the Web, readers can choose from 2.5 million titles under one roof, covering both in-print and out-of-print books. In addition to general purpose bookstores, specialty stores carry books on antiques, books written in foreign languages, rare editions, and other books that would require extensive phone calls and physical trips to obtain. On the Web, readers can enter the keywords identifying the types of books they want, choose some promising sites, search their inventories, and often have the book delivered within a few days or a week.  41   CONVENIENCE Consumers cite convenience as the number one reason for making a purchase online. Shopping on the Internet can save time. A consumer does not have to travel to a store site or adjust his schedule around the store's hours. No longer does a consumer have to wait on hold for a customer service representative to answer the phone. Recognizing that customers may want products delivered as soon as possible, many sites offer next day or second-day delivery. Online support tools--order status, product availability and pricing, technical support and troubleshooting tips--are generally supplemented with toll-free numbers that customers may call for further information. The example of Garden Escape, an Internet-based gardening company, shows how combining products and services in a virtual ""store"" can save consumers a great deal of time and effort. The founders of Garden Escape wanted to create a one-stop shop for gardening needs. They began by taking an inventory of all the resources a gardener uses today: nurseries and seed catalogs for plants and tools, other retailers for specialty outdoor products; books and magazines for tips on the plants and flowers that flourish or perish in certain soil and climate conditions; gardening clubs where hobbyist gardeners share suggestions with other enthusiasts; and the extensive array of catalogs, books and CD-ROMs that help gardeners in designing a garden. By offering a virtual, rather than real, inventory, Garden Escape offers a selection of products that even the largest nursery could not possibly stock--a selection of 10,000 seeds, perennials, roses, bulbs, greenhouses, tools and other gardening products from around the world. Serious gardeners can use online software tools to design their ideal garden. For suggestions and tips, there's an online magazine, a chat room and new daily tips from the magazine's editors. A consumer with a question about a horticultural term can check out the glossary, or call Garden Escape's toll-free number.  BETTER AND MORE COMPLETE INFORMATION Web consumers are often better informed than their offline counterparts. Two examples--shopping for a car and shopping for an insurance policy--illustrate the differences between purchasing via the Internet and purchasing through traditional means. Shopping for a car can be a very complex process. model of car, outfitting it with different accessories options (whether to lease or buy and how to obtain insurance policy, and negotiating a fair price. Prior could take a lot of time, and many consumers went changes the dynamic. It involves choosing a particular make and and performance options, choosing financing the best rates), purchasing or updating an auto to the Internet, gathering that information to dealer showrooms ill-prepared. The Web  Web shoppers can view pictures of different car models and read extensive information on the car's features and performance. Financing and insurance options are also available online. 42   At Auto-by-Tel, a leading Web-based auto marketplace, shoppers can access model and pricing information, including dealer invoice pricing and manufacturer rebate information on all new and used cars from 2,700 accredited dealers from across the country. Along with a picture of the car and brief descriptions, the customer can access new-car and used-car pricing from third party sources like AutoSite, Edmund's, CarCenter and the Kelley Blue Book. After deciding which car to buy, the customer enters the zip code where he or she lives and the make and model of the car desired. A screen pops up requesting that the customer indicate what color exterior and interior he wants, the type of transmission, the number of cylinders, and when they prefer a 2-door or 4-door model. Then the customer completes a new car purchase request, selecting the manufacturer options to include on the car (radio, power windows, anti-lock brakes, sunroof, etc.) After making these selections and providing contact information, the customer's request is transmitted to the Auto-by-Tel dealer closest to the customer's home. Within 24 hours, the dealer contacts the customer with a firm price. Internet businesses selling life insurance products arm consumers with software tools that help them determine what types of insurance they might need, as well as information to enable them make educated choices between one insurer's policy and another's. Quicken InsureMarket, an Internet-based insurance marketplace, provides one illustration. Visitors maneuver through the InsureMarket site, accessing only the information they want; for example, an explanation of a term they do not understand, information about the carrier's rating, or how much and which type of insurance is suitable for them, given their family's financial profile. A consumer can comparison shop for term life policies by clicking on a button and answering some basic questions about residence, age, health, income, family situation, and the amount of insurance desired. In a matter of moments, the customer receives personalized quotes from up to seven carriers and up to four agent contact options. The system randomly generates the order of the insurance carriers providing quotes and referrals the visitor sees so as not to give an advantage to any single carrier. At a glance, the customer can compare the policies and the prices of several different carriers. Another few clicks of the mouse, and the customer has more information about each carrier and policy to determine whether a price difference between apparently similar policies is really justified. LOWER PRICES Commerce, and therefore competition, on the Internet is still undeveloped. A good deal of Internet retail is being driven by convenience, the search for a broader selection, or the opportunity to find items not readily available in ordinary retail outlets. Despite its infancy, some Internet retailers offer discounts from traditional channels. For instance, online booksellers discount some books by 40 percent over typical bookstore prices.94 (Depending on the cost of delivery, the total cost of an item may be higher on the Internet than at a store.) Consumers buying and selling stocks through the Internet commonly pay $8- $30 per trade, while traditional brokerages charge approximately $80 per trade on average.95 Internet users can access most online news and information free of charge. 43   This pattern of lower prices is not universal. Some retailers have determined that their current Internet customers buy products from them primarily because of convenience, selection or quality. In the short term, they do not feel that lowering prices would lead to additional sales. Some traditional store-based retailers set their prices for products they sell through the Internet at the level found in their stores in order not to adversely impact their store-based business. If retailing continues to grow on the Internet, competition and the favorable economics of the Internet are likely to translate into lower prices for the average consumer.  CUSTOMIZATION The Internet offers the potential for increased customization. Some Web businesses, particularly media businesses, already customize the product to an audience of one. Readers can select only the news they want to read, and it gets ""delivered"" to their personalized Web page on the site, to an e-mail box, or as a service that the computer defaults to when at rest. Music and computers are other products where the combination of innovation and economics is encouraging increased customization. Customers at online music stores have the choice of purchasing CDs available at record stores. Or, if they desire, they can create their own CDs from a growing number of digital recordings. Buying a laptop computer is no longer limited to what a store or a manufacturer has in stock. Instead, consumers can choose from a variety of base models, and purchase the standard configuration or customize the machine according to price and performance requirements. (For instance, the customer can decide whether to pay extra for a speedy 266MHz processor or save some money with a somewhat slower 166MHz processor. Similarly, the base model may have 48 MB of memory (RAM), but additional memory is available for those who need it. Different modems, network adaptors, extra batteries and software packages can be installed by the factory at the customer's request. Even the service package can be tailored to the customer's needs. Traditional retail and mail order outlets, in addition to Web businesses, offer customers the opportunity to customize their computers; the Internet and private networks speed the flow of information and thereby improve the economics of customization. Web-based clothing stores may soon incorporate technology that allows customers to ""try on"" clothing. Deciding between a Large or Extra-Large sweater may be as simple using the computer mouse to ""drag"" the virtual sweater over a 3-D image of oneself to see whether it is too snug or a perfect fit. For retailers and manufacturers who continue to produce standard sizes for their customers, this technology will simulate the physical act of trying on clothing in a store's dressing room. Other businesses may decide to build a business around tailored clothing, using the 3-D image to customize the size and fit of the sweater to that individual customer. The Internet and other new technologies may encourage businesses to explore the feasibility of mass customization; whether and how extensively retailers and manufacturers start to customize clothing, furniture, and other products based on individual customer specifications will ultimately depend on market demand. 44   THE FUTURE Today's Web consumers benefit from a selection of products and services unparalleled in traditional channels. Without leaving home or an office, consumers can access thousands of Web sites to become informed about breaking news and events, research products, and purchase everything from groceries to books to insurance policies. Whether they complete the transaction online or make the purchase at a store after using the Web to help narrow the search for a particular product, the Web arms the consumer with much more knowledge about choices and prices available to them. Despite these advantages, many consumers today still remain wary of the Internet. They are concerned about protecting their privacy and the security of their credit card information. Many do not have computers, or find them too difficult to use. Or, they prefer the experience of shopping and selecting products they can see, feel, or try on in person. For these reasons, shopping in stores will likely be the main way that consumers purchase goods for many years to come. However, the barriers to Internet shopping are likely to be lower for younger consumers. Children today are growing up with the Internet. Over the next decade, as today's children become adults, shopping on the Internet will be easy and natural to them. The growth in the numbers of individuals using the Internet provides strong evidence that consumers perceive its benefits. As more individuals come online, as the Internet becomes easier to access, as Internet commerce increases, and as today's children become adults, the combined effect will be to further enhance the already-present benefits the Internet has to offer.  45   CHAPTER SEVEN: WORKERS IN THE DIGITAL AGE  The rapid growth of the computing and telecommunications industries has already created a large and growing demand for programmers, systems analysts, computer scientists and engineers. If electronic commerce begins to substitute for more conventional sales and services, it will shift employment from traditional occupations to those requiring IT skills and, in many instances, other higher-level cognitive reasoning abilities. Electronic commerce is very much part of a broader national trend that requires more skills in the work place and an improved basic education in mathematics and science. The digital age will also create greater opportunities for telecommuting, and already strong trends towards globalization will accelerate.  CHANGING SKILL REQUIREMENTS Demand for workers in IT industries and workers with occupations focused on the design, programming, maintenance and repair of the computing and communications infrastructure will continue to grow. In 1996, more than 7 million people worked in these jobs and they earned an average annual wage of just under $46,000. Over the next ten years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that an additional 2 million workers will be needed to fill these jobs. Companies already report difficulties in filling these positions today. Workers with information technology skills are needed across the economy. An analysis of IT occupations shows that the demand for workers to fill higher-skilled IT jobs (computer engineers, scientists, and systems analysts) is expected to grow from 874,000 in 1996 to 1.8 million by 2006.96 These positions typically require a four-year undergraduate degree, often in a field of science, mathematics or engineering, and in many cases, advanced training or a graduate degree. Employment in lesser-skilled jobs like computer operators and duplicating machine operators is expected to decline from 481,000 in 1996 to 342,000 by 2006. As electronic commerce becomes more widespread, it, too, will likely drive changes in the labor market. In most cases, the share of sales generated by a company's Web business is still only a small fraction of the company's total business. As it increases, however, the composition of the workforce required to produce and deliver a product or service may shift. For instance, if online delivery of news services replaces some portion of the conventionally delivered news, workers may gradually shift away from the printing or delivery of newspapers to the creation of content or managing of computers. Workers manning printing presses, driving trucks, and staffing news stands have no role in online news distribution. Their function is 46   performed by new workers responsible for programming, operating and maintaining the computer servers that ""distribute"" the news to Web readers. The same could be true for retail as online sales begin to substitute for in-store sales. Today, a super store might be staffed by a few hundred employees. Warehouse personnel receive new merchandise into the store and keep the shelves and bins filled. Salespeople advise customers on product features, check availability of merchandise not found on the shop floor, and book special orders. Cashiers ring up the sale and bag the goods. Back-office staff keep track of inventory and sales patterns, pay vendors and payroll, deposit sales receipts, and manage the day-to-day store operations. Other workers keep the store and its grounds clean and well-maintained. A retail sale via the Internet does not require the presence of a physical store or the same intensity of staff in order to generate the sale. Virtual retailers will hire people with IT skills to develop and program software, and operate and maintain computer servers and networks. They will also need marketing staff, accounting departments, customer service representatives and people skilled in graphic design to keep their Web site, or ""storefront,"" attractive and user friendly. Whether a retailer handles the physical distribution of its own products or contracts with another company to perform that function, warehouse and distribution personnel will continue to be necessary to transport products from the manufacturer's site to the customer's home. Retailers with an existing store infrastructure are likely to position the online business as complementary to their traditional store business, at least in the near term. Until online sales are of a size to warrant a dedicated distribution strategy, traditional retailers may choose to deliver goods to Web customers from the nearest store location, adding to the workload of existing warehouse personnel. Other retailers may choose to have manufacturers package and mail or ""drop ship"" goods directly to customers without going through any intermediate steps. Or, they may outsource the entire logistics process for the online business to a third party. In any of these scenarios, few store personnel would be involved in an online sale. Jobs characterized by a transfer of information from one party to another--travel agents, insurance agents, stock brokers, customer service representatives--will likely see routine tasks like order taking disappear, and more complicated tasks replacing them. For instance, a leisure traveler making plans to go home for the holidays usually knows all the carriers flying that route and simply needs to make the reservation and pay for the flight. That would be a case of order taking, a function as easily performed online as by calling the airline or a travel agent. On the other hand, a couple planning a trip to South Africa might seek the advice of someone who has been to the region, who can recommend hotels in the wine country near Cape Town and safaris in Kruger. Similarly, someone purchasing a term life policy with a face value of $400,000 may feel comfortable enough researching and purchasing that policy online. To help make the decision of whether to buy a whole or variable life insurance policy or put the money into an Individual Retirement Account or other investment vehicle, however, he might prefer to consult an expert in person.  47   WORKFORCE FLEXIBILITY Workforce flexibility refers to a company's ability to produce products and services with less rigid organizational structures. It also refers to a worker's ability to work without being tied to a desk or an office. The growth in information technology has played an important role in both driving the need for a new work force and in enabling greater flexibility in the work place. In the old model of industrial organization, production workers performed tasks by rote, over and over again throughout a shift. A car frame rolled down an assembly line, a worker attached a part, it proceeded to the next worker who performed the next process, and on it continued until a completed car emerged at the other end. A bank teller opened accounts, accepted deposits and provided account balance information. Someone else handled transactions involving Certificates of Deposit, Money Market Accounts and safety deposit boxes. Bureaucratic work organizations are giving way to flexible ""cells"" and teams that cross the oncerigid lines of job description, management reporting structures, and business units. This transformation often results from a corporate objective to implement total quality management (TQM) and Six Sigma (a benchmark of nearly zero defects) systems throughout their organizations. Reducing errors and return rates, lowering cycle times and reducing costs means getting it done right the first time. People on the ""front lines"" - - the factory floor, the sales department, the customer service organization - - need to have the education and information to make decisions and solve problems. Companies with successful TQM and Six Sigma initiatives invest heavily in training and education. They also give employees the tools they need: clearlystated objectives and real-time feedback on how well those objectives are being met. A robust computer network with online training and support tools can reinforce (or substitute for) inclassroom training sessions. It also keeps workers up-to-date with the latest forecasts, the current day's production or sales requirements, materials shortages, and other information in order to better perform the day's tasks and anticipate future needs. As more companies move to this method of work organization, the need to share information and knowledge across the enterprise will increase. Internal corporate networks and the Internet will play an important role in enabling this transition. Thanks to personal computers, fax machines, modems and cellular phones, as many as seven million workers in the United States work at home in ""virtual offices.""97 The Department of Transportation estimates that up to 15 million workers may be telecommuting in the next decade. Organizations with telecommuting programs report an increase in productivity, faster completion of assignments, fewer sick or absent days, better time management and increased morale and commitment to the company. They also benefit from reduced office space needs and associated costs, an enhanced ability to attract and retain quality employees, and improved customer service.98  48   Telecommuting benefits employees, as well. For those who need to balance work commitments with family commitments, telecommuting provides the means for working and communicating with coworkers and clients from home. Employees working part-time can manage their time more effectively, spending less time driving to one or more offices, and instead focusing on completing work assignments.  GLOBALIZATION Information technology has opened up new opportunities for global commerce. The signals transmitted over the Internet do not recognize national borders. Work on the same project can be done in several places or several countries without workers having to physically relocate. Organizations can now deploy resources and operations around the world. Information about new product introductions, corporate earnings, forecasted sales patterns, and materials requirements can be shared almost instantaneously via corporate e-mail systems and value-added networks, and now, over the Internet. Developing software, designing a car, providing consulting services to a client, can be done collaboratively by teams of employees from different parts of the world. For instance, an engineer in California can send an e-mail at the close of her business day to a colleague in Singapore, asking him to look over the attached design specifications for a new product. By the time she arrives for work the next morning, a reply could be sitting in her ""in-box"" with a marked-up set of specifications. With the opportunities come serious challenges. Countries that have an insufficient supply of skilled workers will see high-skilled, high-paying jobs migrate to countries that can supply the needed talent. Those that have a surplus will find job opportunities opening for their workers in overseas organizations. Even though the United States has led the world into the digital age, we face these same realities. Without a concerted effort to develop students and workers to meet the new challenges of the digital economy, the United States could face a migration of high-skilled, high-wage jobs to other countries.  49   CHAPTER EIGHT: CHALLENGES AHEAD  This report has focused on the emergence of the digital economy--the promise it contains and some of the challenges it poses. Some of the challenges are technical, others involve the development of standards, and still others require significant capital investments. The digital revolution is also changing the respective roles of government and the private sector. In the 19th and for much of the 20th centuries, governments played a key role in helping build or actively regulate much of the country's infrastructure. The federal government made extensive land grants to encourage private capital to expand the nation's rail network. Government subsidies were used to stimulate the development of an airline industry. Federal and state dollars combined to build and maintain the interstate highway system. In communications, the government granted a virtual monopoly to a single company and regulated the industry after its breakup. Most power companies have been regulated monopolies at the state or federal level. The federal government funded and developed early versions of the Internet for national security and research purposes. It will continue to provide funding for research and development on future Internet and high-performance computing technologies. However, most of the capital to build the computing and telecommunications infrastructure is being provided by the private sector. The pace of technological development and the borderless environment created by the Internet drives a new paradigm for government and private sector responsibilities. Creating the optimal conditions for the new digital economy to flourish requires a new, much less restrictive approach to the setting of rules.  Governments must allow electronic commerce to grow up in an environment driven by markets, not burdened with extensive regulation, taxation or censorship. While government actions will not stop the growth of electronic commerce, if they are too intrusive, progress can be substantially impeded. Where possible, rules for the Internet and electronic commerce should result from private collection action, not government regulation. Governments do have a role to play in supporting the creation of a predictable legal environment globally for doing business on the Internet, but must exercise this role in a non-bureaucratic fashion. Greater competition in telecommunications and broadcast industries should be encouraged so that high-bandwidth services are brought to homes and offices around the world and so 50         that the new converged market place of broadcast, telephony and the Internet operate based on laws of competition and consumer choice rather than those of government regulation.   There should be no discriminatory taxation against Internet commerce. The Internet should function as a seamless global marketplace with no artificial barriers erected by governments.  As with any major societal transformation, the digital economy will foster change and some upheaval. The Industrial Revolution brought great economic and social benefit, but it also brought about massive dislocations of people, increased industrial pollution, unhealthy child labor and unsafe work environments. Societies were often slow in responding to these negative side effects. Similarly, the digital economy may bring potential invasions of privacy, easier access by children to pornographic and violent materials and hate speech, more sophisticated and far-reaching criminal activity and a host of other as-yet unknown problems. The private sector and government, working together, must address these problems in ways that make the Internet a safe environment while not impeding its commercial development. The U.S. Government's ""Global Framework for Electronic Commerce,"" posted on the Internet at http://www.ecommerce.gov, describes a market-driven framework that will stimulate the growth of the digital economy while offering flexible, industry-driven solutions that will effectively address problems that may arise. Steps are now being taken in the United States and around the world to meet these public policy goals. Perhaps the greatest challenge the U.S. faces, however, is to put in place the human resource policies necessary for the digital economy. If the trends described in this study continue, millions of jobs will likely be created, while millions of others will be lost. The good news is that the net economic growth anticipated by this digital revolution will likely create more jobs than those that are lost. Further, the jobs created are likely to be higher-skilled and higher-paying than those that will be displaced. However, it is clear that we will face great challenges in preparing the current workforce and future workers to fill the new jobs that will be created. If we do not have a sufficient number of well-educated and trained people to fill these jobs, then the good news can turn to bad. If these public policy issues can be resolved, and electronic commerce is allowed to flourish, the digital economy could accelerate world economic growth well into the next century.  51   ENDNOTES  1.

Forbes. July 7, 1997. pp.144-171. Thomas Newcomen developed the first practical steam engine in 1712, used primarily for pumping water out of mines. This engine was only practical near a source of wood or coals. James Watt's steam engine of 1769 added a separate condenser which increased the fuel efficiency by a factor of four. Due to this addition, a steam engine could be put anywhere and the fuel hauled to it. In 1782, Watt modified the engine by introducing a rotary motion that could turn a shaft. Michael Faraday first harnessed electricity in 1831 by means of motion in a magnetic field.

In the early days of the Internet, most messages were simple text that did not require large amounts of bandwidth. Bandwidth requirements have increased as people began to send images, sound, software, video and voice over the Internet. In a packet-switched system, a message is broken into chunks and each chunk or ""packet"" is individually addressed and individually routed across the network to its destination. At the destination, the message is reassembled. Packets that do not arrive at the destination are retransmitted. As Vint Cerf, one of the inventors of the Internet, describes it: Packet switching is conceptually similar to the way the postal service works. That is, each letter or postcard is individually addressed and moves geographically from point-to-point as it travels towards its destination. Two postcards mailed from a post office in San Francisco may take different routes to New York, but once they arrive at the New York City post office, they are assembled with the other mail going to the destination address and delivered. Each ""packet"" is like a postcard and network routers are like the mail stops along the way. Meeker, Mary and Pearson, Sharon. Morgan Stanley U.S. Investment Research: Internet Retail. Morgan Stanley. May 28, 1997. pp.2-2, 2-6. Notes: Data for TV and other media are U.S. figures. PC figures reflect worldwide users. Morgan Stanley uses the launch of HBO in 1976 as their estimate for the beginning of cable. ""Though cable technology was developed in the late 1940's, its initial use was primarily for the improvement of reception in remote areas. It was not until HBO began to distribute its pay-TV movie service via satellite in 1976 that the medium became a distinct content and advertising alternative to broadcast television."" In 1989, the World Wide Web (WWW) protocols for transferring hypertext via the Internet were first used in experimental form at the European Center for Particle Research 53  11. 12. 13. 14. 15.  16.  17.  18.   (CERN) in Switzerland. In 1991, the National Science Foundation lifted the restrictions on the commercial use of the Internet. That same year, the World Wide Web (WWW) was released by CERN. In 1993, the alpha version of Mosaic, the graphical user interface to the WWW, was released, giving non-technical users the ability to navigate the Internet. This report uses 1993 as the date when the Internet became truly open to the public. See: Cerf, Vint. ""The Internet Phenomenon."" National Science Foundation Web page. Http://www.cise.nsf.gov/general/compsci/net/cerf.html No exact figures exist on Internet usage worldwide, but different sources point to 1997 as the year when Internet usage approaches/crosses the 50 million mark. For instance, NUA, an Internet consultancy and developer, compiles figures from different research analysts and finds the following ranges of Internet usage: 1995: 8-30 million, 1996: 28-40 million, 1997: >100 million.

In his book, Digital Economy, Don Tapscott cites the New Paradigm Learning Corporation when he estimates that there should be well over 1 billion Internet users by 2000. Others feel that 2000 may be too optimistic, as much of the developing world does not even have a basic telecommunications infrastructure. As new investments in fiber, satellite, wireless and cable are made, more of the world will be connected to the Internet. One billion people on the Internet by 2005 could therefore be possible.

Forrester Research. July 1997. Forrester Research predicts that business-to-business electronic commerce will reach $327 billion by 2002. A conservative estimate for the combined online transactions for Cisco, Dell and GE in 1997 would be $3 billion. During the first 10 months of 1997, Cisco booked more than $1 billion in sales via the Internet. Although Dell did not report its 1997 sales via the Internet, a rough estimate would place them between $750 million - $1 billion for the year. GE reports having purchased over $1 billion online in 1997. In three to five years' time, Internet commerce for the three companies will, by their own estimates, reach or exceed $17 billion. Cisco expects online sales to grow to 60 percent of total volume over the next year. If analyst projections for Cisco to grow to a $10.5 billion company by July of 1999 are correct, Cisco's online sales will reach $5-6 billion by then. Dell expects to conduct half its total business online shortly after the year 2000. Even taking 50 percent of its current volume ($12 billion in 1997 and growing rapidly) would lead to $6 billion in online sales shortly after the year 2000. By 2000, GE aims to have all 12 of its business units purchasing via the Internet, for a total of $5 billion.  47.  48. 49. 50. 51.  52.  53.  54.

Domestic and worldwide use of computer hardware and software products and communications equipment and services is converging into a single market. This market supports the global information infrastructure (GII), which is dominated by the Internet. Although IT is used by all industries to some degree, industries that support the GII are, for the purpose of this report, considered to be IT industries (Table 1). The criteria for the selection of IT industries and the methodology used to derive the charts below are described in the ""Data and Methodology"" section. IT industries enable electronic commerce (e-commerce), thus their health and/or performance give some indication of the potential size and likely growth of e-commerce. This analysis presents an estimate of the size and growth of IT industries and their importance to overall U.S. economic and employment growth. Growth of IT industries provides us with some idea of the past and probable future success of e-commerce, but should not be interpreted as a direct measure of it. IT Industries and Recent Economic Performance The economy has been performing well lately, in terms of growth, employment, inflation, and productivity. Between 1996 and 1997, the economy grew 3.8 percent in inflation adjusted or real dollars, about 3 million new civilian employees were added, inflation remained low, 2.3 percent,1 and business productivity increased by 1.9 percent. Some analysts believe that growth of the IT sector helps account for a large part of this good performance and the findings in this paper lend support to their assessments. In recent testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Alan Greenspan noted that ""... our nation has been experiencing a higher growth rate of productivity -- output per hour worked -- in recent years. The dramatic improvements in computing power and communication and information technology appear to have been a major force behind this beneficial trend.""2 Other analysts believe, however, that other factors may account for recent good performance and that the data do not yet confirm whether the recent burst of activity in the IT sector has had large positive effects on the rest of the economy. Because of the lags between bursts of investment and their economic effects taking hold, we are not yet able to assess the full economic effects of the recent dramatic growth in IT investment.  A1 - 1   One of the most notable developments in recent years has been the rapid increase in the IT sector's (computing and communications) share of investment activity and the overall economy. IT grew from 4.9 percent of the economy in 1985 to 6.1 percent in 1990. In 1990, the IT share of the economy was proportional to its contribution to overall economic growth. Beginning in 1994, however, the IT sectors contributed twice its share of the economy to overall nominal economic growth. In 1996, IT industries accounted for an estimated 7.5 percent share of the economy3 and an estimated 15.8 percent of the rise in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), in current dollar terms as measured by its earned income. By 1997, IT industries accounted for an estimated 7.8 percent of GDP and 12.4 percent of its nominal growth, while in 1998, IT industries may account for as much as 8.2 percent of the economy and an estimated 14.7 percent of its nominal growth. What makes this rise in IT's nominal share of the economy even more remarkable is the fact that IT prices, adjusted for quality improvements, have been falling while prices in the rest of the economy have been rising. In 1996 and 1997, declining prices in IT industries (as measured by their overall implicit deflator) lowered the annual change in prices in the overall economy by an estimated one full percentage point. Thus, the estimated real contribution of this sector to economic expansion was greater than what the nominal shares indicate. In recent years, an average of over one-quarter of total real economic growth can be attributed to IT industries. In 1996, the IT workforce, as defined by employment in IT industries (Table 1) and employees with IT-related occupations (Table 2), across the economy, was 7.4 million workers (6.2 percent  Table 1.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that the demand for these workers will increase to 9.5 million by 2006. The fastest growing segment of IT workers is in the software and services industries. Between 1985 and 1996, employment in these industries more than doubled from just over one-half million workers to 1.2 million with an average annual wage of about $56,000. By 2006, BLS projects the demand for these workers to double again to 2.5 million. The debate over the relation of IT industries to the health of the economy will continue for some time. Although the results of this paper suggest a healthy relationship, more data and analysis, especially in the area of IT-generated productivity improvements throughout the economy and the contribution to non-inflationary growth, are needed.  A1 - 3   IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, INFLATION, AND BUSINESS INVESTMENT  Share of the Economy and Contribution to Growth The IT share of the economy, in current dollars, hovered between 4and 5-percent from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s (Figure 1). Then, as the personal computer became more common in business and in the home, the IT share of the economy jumped by 1.2 percentage points between 1985 and 1990 to reach 6.1 percent. With the commercialization of the Internet, it started its upward climb again, growing from 6.4 percent in 1993 to an expected 8.2 percent by 1998. Between 1990 and 1998, value added of IT industries are expected to roughly double, growing from $347 billion to $680 billion (Figure 2). Hardware sales, comprised of computer hardware, electronic components, and some instruments, are expected to grow from $116 billion in 1990 to $254 billion by 1998--more than doubling over the period. Software sales are expected to increase by two and one-half times from $60 billion to $152 billion. Value added of the communications industries, by comparison, is expected to increase by about 60 percent, from $171.2 billion in 1990 to $276.5 billion in 1998. Figure 1.

For instance, in 1991, IT industries accounted for 6.1 percent of the economy and 6.2 percent of overall economic growth (Figure 3A). Since the commercialization of the Internet in the mid-1990s, IT's contribution to nominal GDP growth has expanded rapidly. Between 1994 and 1998, IT is responsible for 11-16 percent of overall economic growth, while its share of the economy ranges between 6.8-8.2 percent.  Figure 3A. IT Industries: Contribution to Economic Growth Rises from 6% in 1991 to Around 14% between 1995 and 1998 (percent) 18.0 16.0 14.0 12.0 10.0 8.0 6.0 4.0 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 actual estimated  Source: ESA estimates based on BEA and Census data  The contribution of IT industries to nominal growth in the economy understates its full impact. The difference between the nominal and real contributions to growth results from significant productivity growth in some of these industries. Large gains in the quality of IT products, particularly computers and semiconductors, have been achieved without comparable increases in costs.5 Between 1992 and 1997, IT industries contributed over onequarter of the real growth in the economy.6 (Figure 3B) The IT contribution to real economic growth fluctuates considerably from year to year. From 1992 to 1994, IT growth was only slightly higher than overall economic growth.7 In 1995, a spurt of investment in IT products in combination with a rather lackluster economy resulted in a dramatic increase in the IT contribution to real economic growth. By 1997, the IT contribution to real economic growth dropped back down to just over one-quarter, primarily  Figure 3B.

The inflation adjusted measure of the IT sector may overstate its practical contribution to overall economic growth, as businesses may not yet taking full advantage of the quality improvements in the IT products. Inflation and IT Industries Since 1996, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has adopted quality-adjusted price indexes for computers and semiconductors for use in their real GDP calculations. The need to incorporate quality-adjusted deflators (sometimes called hedonic deflators) arose because of the increasing performance and declining prices of these products. Since the 1960s, the performance of microprocessors has followed Moore's Law--transistor (or microprocessor) density doubling about every 18 months. And during this time of phenomenal growth in performance, the average price of the transistor has fallen by an unprecedented six orders of magnitude. A doubling of microprocessor performance every 18 months is projected to continue for the next 20 years.8 Figure 4.

Industry Use of IT Equipment IT industries not only directly have more than proportional impact on the growth of the economy, but the use of IT products has been an important and growing part of capital investments across all industries. In 1994, of the 53 aggregate industry sectors (across the economy), 40 percent or more of the total capital stock of 15 industries was comprised of IT equipment, 13 between 25 and 39 percent, 20 between 10 to 24 percent, and only 5 had a less than 10 percent share. IT spending, in inflation adjusted dollars,10 as a share of total business equipment spending, grew A1 - 6   from negligible to 45 percent in a little over 30 years (Figure 5). In 1965, business spending for IT equipment was less than 5 percent of total business spending. By the early 1980s, IT spending jumped to about 15 percent. In the early 1990s, IT spending represented about one-third of all business equipment spending, and by 1996, almost half. The slope of the curve suggests that by 2000, business spending for IT equipment should exceed half of all spending on capital equipment. A parallel can be drawn between the proliferation of computers (and other IT equipment) in the last three decades and the spread of electricity in the mid 1800s and early 1900s.11 First harnessed  F i g u re 5. 50% 45% 40% 35% 30%  Infor m a ti o n T e c h n o l o g y S p e n d i n g a s a S h a re of B u s in e s s E q u ip m e n t S p e n d in g C o m m e rcial I nternet  P C I n troduction 25% 20% 15% 10% 5% 0% 1960 Source: 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 * Inflation-adjusted investment in information processing equip ment (office, computing, and accounting machinery, communications equipment, instru ments, and photocopying equipment) as a share of total private equipment investment.  Bureau of Economic Analysis  in 1831, electricity's potential had to wait 50 years until the first power station was built in 1882.12 Industry then began a 50-year transition from using mechanical power to using power generated by electricity. In 1899, less than 5 percent of the power used by industry was from electric power generation. Fifty years later, electricity powered 80 percent of factories and households across the country. The increase in the share of IT-related capital by industries corresponds to a decline in the share of the other categories of business equipment and can be viewed as evidence of basic structural change among and within industries. Between 1977 and 1996, the share of business spending for the major categories of capital equipment (with the exception of IT) declined--the share of business spending for industrial equipment such as engines and machinery dropped by 5 percentage points over this period (year-end estimates); transportation equipment, such as trucks and autos, dropped by 2 percentage points; and other capital equipment, such as office furniture, A1 - 7   dropped 3 percentage points. At the same time, the share of business spending for IT-related equipment increased by 10 percentage points. In some industries such as telecommunications, insurance, and securities brokerages, IT equipment constitutes over eighty percent of all the equipment used (Figure 6). IT equipment used per employee is another measure of IT intensity (Figure 7). The top 15 industries, ranked by this criterion, include telecommunications, real estate, radio and television, nonbank financial companies and utilities. They spend over $10,000 (1987 dollars) per employee compared with an economywide average of $2,500. By this measure, while telecommunications remains at the top, other industries such as banks, petroleum, chemicals, and railroad transportation make it to the top tiers as major users of IT equipment.

A1 - 8   THE IT WORKFORCE  Total employment in IT-related jobs is defined as all employees in IT industries and all employees in IT-related occupations in non-IT industries.13 In 1996, 7.4 million people worked in the IT workforce. Approximately two-thirds of these jobs were in IT industries, the other one-third were spread across the rest of the economy. The sections that follow include a separate analysis of employment in IT industries followed by a discussion of employment in IT-related occupations. Note that workers in IT industries and workers with IT-related occupations are not additive since approximately one-third of the workers with IT-related occupations are in IT industries. Employment in IT Industries Employment in IT industries has remained relatively stable even as its share of the economy has grown (Figure 8). From 1985 to 1990, employment in IT industries grew at only 0.4 percent annually, much slower than the 2.4 percent annual rate of growth for all private industries.  Figure 8.

They supplied over 230,000 of the 2.2 million increase in jobs from 1995 to 1996, or 10.5 percent (Figure 9). Employment in IT industries is projected to increase 3.0 percent annually from 1996 to 2006, more than twice as fast as the U.S. average of 1.4 percent. Although historical employment data suggest little change in aggregate IT employment, there has been a fundamental shift in employment among industries. IT industries that produce computer A1 - 9   hardware and communications equipment have lost jobs as technological changes have made some processes routine, thus eliminating jobs or reducing the need for in-house staff to perform some jobs.14 Increased outsourcing is reflected in increased employment in IT industries that provide maintenance and other support services. Also, more computer assembly is being done at the wholesale level. Among the four IT industry groups, providers of software and services have experienced the most rapid employment growth. From 1985 to 1996, employment in these industries more than doubled from 557,000 to 1.2 million workers, with the fastest growth occurring in the computer programming and prepackaged software industries (Figure 10). By 2006, software and services employment will more than double again to 2.5 million workers, still driven by computer programming and prepackaged software industries. Communications equipment and communications services have seen slow employment growth, despite above average growth in sub-industries such as household audio and video equipment retail stores and cable television. In 1996 there were 116,000 fewer workers in industries that produce computer and related hardware than in 1985. However, employment in several subindustries such as computer retail sellers and manufacturers of laboratory analytical instruments has grown faster than average.  Figure 9.

In 1996, the average annual wages paid to workers in IT industries was almost $48,000 compared with $28,000 for all private employees.  Among the IT industries, workers in the software and services industries earned the highest annual wages, almost $56,000 in 1996 (Figure 12).

Employment in IT Occupations In addition to the IT industries themselves, IT workers are needed across the economy to install, operate, program, repair, maintain, design and develop IT equipment and services (Table 2). Table 2. IT-Related Occupations Engineering, science, and computer systems managers Electrical and electronic engineers Electrical technicians Electrical power line installers and repairers Electronics repairers Communications equipment operators Central office and PBX installers and repairers Calculating machine operators Electronic semiconductor assemblers Telephone and Cable TV installers and repairers Computer engineers, scientists, and systems analysts Computer programmers Computer and peripheral equipment operators Data entry keyers Electronic equipment assemblers Data processing equipment repairers Broadcast technicians Duplicating machine operators Electromechanical equipment assemblers Electrical and electronic assemblers  A1 - 12   In 1996, 4.2 million people worked in IT-related occupations. About one-third of these workers (1.4 million) were employed by IT industries and 2.8 million worked in non-IT industries. As an example, in 1996 there were 1.4 million computer scientists, systems analysts, computer engineers, and computer programmers. The services sector employed 47.7 percent of these workers--primarily in business services, health services, education, and engineering services. Durable goods manufacturing industries, financial services, and government were other large employers (Figure 13). The number of IT workers increased from 3.1 million in 1983 to 3.7 million in 1990 (Figure 14). After the slight decline in the early 1990s, IT jobs grew to 4.2 million by 1996.

Some IT-Related Occupations Engineering, Science, and Computer Systems Managers plan, coordinate, and direct research, development, design, production, and computer-related activities. Many have a bachelor's or master's degree in computer or information science. In 1996, the mean annual wage of these managers was almost $66,000. Computer engineers, scientists, and systems analysts--Computer engineers work with the hardware and software aspects of systems design and development. Computer scientists generally design computers and the software that runs them, and conduct research. Systems analysts use their skill in computers to develop business specific applications. Ph.D.'s or, at least master's degrees, are preferable for scientists and engineers in research labs or academic institutions. In 1996, the mean annual wage of computer engineers was almost $55,000. The mean annual wage of systems analysts and computer programmers, combined, was $48,000. Electrical and Electronics Engineers design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment, including computer hardware, and communications and video equipment. A bachelor's degree is required for beginning engineers. In 1996, their mean annual wage was about $53,000. Computer programmers write and maintain the detailed instructions that computers must execute to perform their functions. There are no universal training requirements for programmers, although the majority hold a four-year degree. In 1996, the mean annual wage of these workers (combined with systems analysts) was $48,000. Communications Equipment Mechanics install, repair, and maintain complex and sophisticated communications equipment. Most employers prefer one to two years of training in electronics. In 1996, the mean annual wage for central office and PBX installers and repairers was about $40,000. Broadcast Technicians install, test, repair, set up, and operate electronic equipment used to record and transmit radio and television programs. Employers prefer workers with training in broadcast technology or in engineering or electronics. A four-year college degree is not a prerequisite. In 1996, their mean annual wage was about $31,000. Computer and Office Machine Repairers install, maintain, and repair computer and office equipment. Most employers prefer applicants with formal one- to two-year training in electronics specializing in computers. In 1996, their mean annual wage was $29,000.  A1 - 14   BLS projects that 5.6 million workers will be needed to fill IT-related jobs by 2006. The demand for higher skilled IT jobs is expected to grow dramatically while the demand for lesser-skilled IT jobs is expected to decline (Figure 15). For instance, jobs for computer engineers, scientists, and systems analysts which typically require at least a four-year college degree, grew from 474,000 in 1990 to 874,000 in 1996. By 2006, BLS projects that 1.8 million people will be needed to fill these jobs. The demand for computer programmers, jobs requiring two to four years of college or advanced training, is expected to increase, rising from 548,000 in 1996 to 665,000 in 2006. On the other hand, lesser-skilled jobs like computer operators and duplicating machine operators, which only require a high school diploma, are expected to decline from 481,000 in 1996 to 342,000 in 2006.

Lower skilled IT workers include computer and office machine operators.  Source: ESA estimates based on BLS data  The Internet is also driving demand for workers with IT skills. Workers are needed to design Web pages, create graphics, code documents in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and program in Internet languages such as Java and C++. Webmasters responsible for the design, development, operation, and maintenance of Web sites earn starting salaries between $35,000 and $50,000; highly experienced webmasters earn $100,000 or more. Web developers, responsible for the actual creation of the Web site, are reported to earn a median salary of $55,000. On the lower end of the skill level in Internet jobs, customer service representatives that work for Internet Service Providers earn from $14,000 to $17,000 per year and up to $35,000 depending on experience.16 The demand for computer engineers, scientists, systems analysts, and computer programmers is expected to continue to increase through 2006. Despite this growth and anticipated demand, the number of U.S. graduates with a bachelor's degree in computer science declined by 40 percent A1 - 15   between 1986 and 1994. However, a bachelor's degree in computer science is not the only path of entry into an IT occupation. Other related academic fields, such as computer engineering and business information systems, can supply workers in these categories and even graduates in many non-science and engineering fields are employed in IT-related occupations. At the same time demand for workers to fill IT-specific jobs is increasing, workers in a variety of non-IT occupations find themselves using computers and computerized devicesPCs, CAD, and CAM machines, computerized measuring and analytical instruments, testing and diagnostic equipmentto perform their jobs. Somewhat dated statistics (1993) show that nearly half of all workers regularly use a computer in their jobs, with even higher usage among more highly-skilled and educated workers.17 Preparing students and workers to meet current and future labor market demand will require a new and determined commitment to education and training in mathematics and science.

In this definition, IT industries produce, process, or transmit information goods and services as either intermediate demand (inputs to production to other industries) or as final products to consumption, investment, government purchases, or exports.18 Other industries were considered to be IT industries since they provide the necessary infrastructure (communications) for the Internet to operate (Table 4). IT industries are classified (and defined) according to the 1987 SIC manual, published by the Office of Management and Budget. IT industries are further separated into categories of Hardware, Software and Services, and Communications. Hardware industries include computers and equipment, including their wholesale and retail sales, office machines, semiconductors, some other electronic component industries, and industries that produce measurement and laboratory analytical instruments. Wholesale sales of computers and equipment was included to capture the sales by manufacturers through their branch offices, accounted for by the Census as a wholesale sale. These sales were considered to be closely aligned with a manufacturer's sale; excluding their sale would result in a serious undercount. Retail sales were included in order to capture all other sales of computers. Software and services industries include those that provide prepackaged software and services associated with computers. There is some concern that direct sales of software are underestimated because government data only detail the sales of prepackaged software for microcomputers. The cost of software loaded onto a mainframe computer for business or government use, therefore, may not be captured. A much greater problem exists with respect to international trade of software. In this case, the software cost reported to the Customs Bureau as an import might include only the cost of the cassette or CD-ROM. Once in the U.S., the software could be copied and resold any number of times. The same might be true for a U.S. manufacturer with foreign affiliates. In this case, the software could be developed in the U.S. and a single copy sent to their foreign affiliate and copied overseas to be used in their computer production. Accounting for these transactions is difficult to do, if not impossible. Communications equipment and services industries were selected as IT industries since they provide the ""infrastructure"" that allows the connections between computers and servers that enable electronic commerce and provide the highways for access and movement. Despite the attempt to cleanly designate the IT sector, there will always be some subjectivity with the data that are used to measure it. As IT goods and services are increasingly incorporated into non-IT goods and services, it is difficult to draw hard-and-fast boundaries. For instance, semiconductors are used in computers, but they are also used in automobiles, home appliances, and a variety of other goods. Because they provide computing power and intelligence to all of these products, we have included the entire semiconductor industry as IT. Similarly, the majority A1 - 18   of revenue by the telecommunications industry is still generated by traditional telephone service. Over time, however, virtually all IT investment will be part of interlinked communication systems.  Table 4.

Due to the difficulty in isolating IT, no standard definition exists. Different governmental and private sector bodies propose their own definitions, sometimes breaking out IT as a separate sector, sometimes including it as part of a set of industries that they consider to be high-tech. A1 - 19   For example, BEA assesses high-technology industries. In addition to computer equipment and communications industries, their high-tech list includes those that produce an array of hardware for the national defense (military aircraft, aircraft engines, and electronics). The Bureau of the Census has just launched the use of the new industry classification system, called the North American Industry Classification (NAICS)replacing the current SIC systemin their 1997 Economic Census. The NAICS provides for a new Information Sector, but its focus is primarily on industries that produce information and not hardware items such as computers or communications equipment. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Statistical Panel of the Committee on Information, Computers, and Communications Policy, in August 1997, proposed a draft definition of the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) sector.19 Industry associations have also produced varying definitions of IT and high-tech industries, but their selection was in part driven by their membership. For example, the American Electronics Association (AEA) provides an extensive list of industries that they consider as High Technology, inclusive of industries considered to be IT.20 The Information Technology Institute's (ITI) list of IT industries includes a number of those that are also considered IT by the AEA, except for electronic component industries. Many of the industries included in these various definitions of IT are common. A number are not (Table 5).  A1 - 20   Table 5.

Output of IT industries is measured in terms of value added. Value added is equal to total receipts (also known as sales or revenues) and other operating income less purchases of intermediate goods and services from other industries (adjusted for salable inventories) and imports minus purchased operating expenses. Value added can be thought of more directly; i.e., value added is the sum of all earned income of an industry including its salaries and wages, benefits, business taxes, and profits. Value added can be added across industries to produce an aggregate measurement of the IT sector. The value added of all industries is equal to the Gross Domestic Income (GDI). This method of estimating these industries' share of the economy is commonly called an ""income"" side approach. A ""product"" side approach could be used as an alternative. The product side approach adds final expenditures (final demand) on commodities produced by industries by major segments of the economy--consumption, investment, net exports, and government. Final demand across all industries is equal to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Theoretically, the estimates from the income and the product sides should be the same. In practice, they are not and the difference between GDI and GDP is officially known as the ""statistical discrepancy.""21 The income, rather than the product, side approach was used in this analysis since the industry detail (shown in Table 4) available using government value added data exceeds the detail of the available data on commodities. Also, the commodity data are not consistently reported across all components of GDP. The income side approach based on industry data, therefore, allows for more precision in measuring industries. On the other hand, the income side approach forces the analyst to make a number of assumptions about the data, detailed in the next section on value added. The IT workforce is defined as all employees in IT industries and all workers in IT-related occupations, across all industries and government. Care was taken to not double count workers with IT-related occupations working in IT industries. IT employment is presented in two parts-(1) total employment across IT industries and (2) total employment in occupations that are considered to be IT-related. Data are based on historical reporting and projections made by the BLS. The occupations chosen as IT-related were selected in consultation with BLS and other agencies (Table 6).  A1 - 22   Table 6.

The specific sources of data that follow are from the Department of Commerce's Bureau of the Census or BEA.22 The following is a description of the data and estimates made to derive value added for the (1) manufacturing IT industries, (2) the software and services IT industries, (3) the communications services IT industries, (4) the wholesale trade of computer equipment and software, and (5) the retail trade of computer equipment and software (Table 7). Value added for IT manufacturing industries, including the hardware and communications equipment IT industries were taken directly from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) and the 1992 Census of Manufacturers (COM) published by the Bureau of the Census. The latest published ASM is for 1995. The 1996 ASM will be available in 1998. The next COM will be for 1997 and will include industries classified according to the NAICS definitions. Value added of the hardware IT sector increased from $116.1 billion in 1990 to $183.6 billion in 1995. The IT communications equipment sector increased from $24.5 billion in 1990 to $39.9 billion in 1995. Value added for the software and services IT industries was derived using the Census series  A1 - 23   Table 7.

Note: Value added estimates from various sources (see text) *GDP as measured by earned income (Gross Domestic Income)   on services--Current Business Report Service Annual Survey (latest available for 1995) and the 1992 Census of Service Industries. The Service Annual Survey provides estimated receipts for taxable firms by 4-digit SIC industries. The value added of the software and services IT sector increased from $59.7 billion in 1990 to $102.6 billion in 1995. Value added for software and services is not separately reported so that estimates of value added are derived using the methodology outlined below: Calculating Receipts Less Cost of Goods Sold--The first part of the value added calculation (receipts less cost of goods sold) for software and services IT industries was derived using the 1990-1995 annual total receipts by industry from the Service Annual Survey and subtracting cost of goods sold based on the proportion of cost of goods sold to receipts that existed in 1992. The 1992 Census of Services Industries provides a Subject Series called Sources of Receipts and Revenue from which the cost of goods sold can be computed. For the software and services IT industries, the cost of goods sold is mostly negligible; i.e., the cost of goods sold for most of these industries was less than 2.0 percent in 1992. Therefore, for these industries, cost of goods sold were made equal to zero. However, there were three software and services IT industries where the cost of goods sold were significant; i.e., exceeded 2.0 percent. They are (1) the computer rental and leasing industry (SIC 7377) where cost of goods sold in 1992 was equal to 8.6 percent of total receipts, (2) the computer maintenance and repair industry (SIC 7378) was 7.6 percent, and (3) the computer services, not elsewhere classified, industry (SIC 7379) was 2.4 percent. Goods sold from these computer services sectors are primarily computers and computer equipment. Subtracting Purchased Operating Expenses--The 1992 Census of Service Industries series includes another Subject Series called Capital Expenditures, Depreciable Assets, and Operating Expenses. This report lists operating expenses by type and kind of business for payroll, benefits, taxes, depreciation and amortization charges, lease and rental payments, telephone and other purchased communications, purchased utilities, purchased office supplies, and advertising services for 1992. Purchased operating expenses include the depreciation charges, utilities, office supplies, and advertising services. Payroll, benefits, and taxes represent value added. Thus the second part of the value added calculation can be made by using the proportion of purchased operating expenses to total receipts for software and services IT industries that existed in 1992 to subtract from the total receipts less cost of goods sold from 1990 through 1995. Specifically, the proportion of value added to total receipts for software and services IT industries in 1992 are as follows: computer programming services (SIC 7371), 72.6 percent; prepackaged software, (SIC 7372), 66.8 percent; computer A1 - 25   integrated systems design (SIC 7373), 75.8 percent; computer processing and data preparation (SIC 7374), 59.8 percent; information retrieval services (SIC 7375), 71.3 percent; computer services management (SIC 7376), 71.3 percent; computer rental and leasing (SIC 7376), 62.4 percent; computer maintenance and repair (SIC 7378), 63.4 percent, and computer related services, nec (SIC 7379), 68.8 percent. Value added used for the IT communications services industries were taken directly from BEA's Gross Product Originating (GPO) by industry time series instead of using a calculated value added from the Census data. The value added of the communications services sector increased from $146.7 billion in 1990 to $191.6 billion in 1995. The reasons for using the BEA data are: (1) the BEA industries and the list of industries used in the study matched exactly,23 (2) the difference from the published BEA value added and the calculated estimates of value added from the revenue and operating expense data from the Bureau of the Census Annual Survey of Communications Services was less than one percent for each year between 1990 and 1995, and (3) the BEA data were published; the derived value added data from Census were not. It was felt that a published number prevails over a computed number and that value added should, theoretically, equal GPO. Value added for wholesale trade of computer equipment and software were added to the list of IT industries, as sales from manufacturers' branch offices are counted by the Census as a wholesale sale and not as a part of manufacturers' shipments. Wholesale sales of computers and equipment increased from $33.6 billion in 1990 to $50.8 billion in 1995. Wholesale sales of computer software increased from $1.7 billion in 1990 to $2.6 billion in 1995. The primary source for these data is the Bureau of the Census Current Business Report's Annual Benchmark Report for Wholesale Trade, January 1987 Through February 1997. In this report, gross margins (sales less cost of goods sold) by wholesale industries at the aggregate level are reported. Thus, the first part of the value added calculation (sales less cost of goods sold) is reported directly as gross margins. To take the aggregate reporting to the 4-digit SIC detail needed for this report, additional computations were made: Computing Gross Margins at 4-Digit SIC Level The annual benchmark report provides gross margins for 3-digit SIC industries only. For purposes of this report, it was necessary to isolate SIC 5045, Wholesale sales of computer equipment and software, which is a subset of SIC 504, Wholesale sales of professional & commercial equipment and supplies. To achieve this, the 1992 Economic Census of Wholesale Trade was used to derive estimates for value added at the 4-digit SIC level (SIC 5045) and incorporate branch office sales. In this report, data at the 4-digit SIC level are provided that include sales and purchased operating expenses of all the wholesale sales of computer equipment A1 - 26   and software--from merchant wholesalers, from manufacturers' sales from branch offices, and from wholesale sales from agents, brokers, and commission merchants. In 1992, manufacturer sales of computer equipment and software from their branch offices represented 53 percent of all wholesale sales. These sales are unreported in the annual data. The 1992 benchmark report also provides separate categories of SIC 5045--wholesale sales of computer equipment and wholesale sales of computer software. Value added at the 4-digit level is calculated using the same proportions of (1) merchant wholesaler sales to manufacturer branch offices' sales over the period and (2) purchased operating expenses (costs of goods sold are already accounted for in the gross margin data) to sales. Gross margin data at the 3-digit level from the annual report are used as controls to derive the 4-digit value added estimates. Value added for retail trade of computer equipment and software (SIC 5734) were derived in almost the same way as the wholesale estimates. Retail sales of computers and equipment increased from $1.9 billion in 1990 to $2.5 billion by 1995. Retail sales of computer software increased from $93.8 million in 1990 to $126.1 million by 1995. In this case, the Bureau of the Census Annual Benchmark Report for Retail Trade: January 1987 Through December 1996 was used to obtain total sales and gross margins by the aggregate industry category--a combination of SICs 5722, 31, 34 (radio, television and computer stores). The 1992 Census of Retail Trade was then used to disaggregate the aggregate sector into its parts and provide operating expenses of the industry. The 1992 report also provides sales data on both retail sales of computers equipment and software. The proportions developed for 1992 were then applied to the controls in the remaining years to provide estimates of retail sales at the 4-digit level, much the same way used to derive the estimates of value added for the wholesale IT industries. The sum of the value added of all the IT industries compared to total nominal GDP24 was used to compute the IT share of the economy. The nominal share of the economy and contribution to nominal economic growth are computed based on GDP, rather than GDI, although GDI would be a more appropriate measure. This was done since (1) GDP is a far more familiar concept than GDI, (2) GDP is thought to be a more accurate measure of the economy, and (3) the difference between the GDP and GDI IT industry share and contribution to growth are small. In 1996, if IT value added were based on GDI, the share of the economy would have been 7.1 percent rather than 7.4 percent (GDP calculation) and the IT contribution to the growth of the economy would have been 13.4 percent instead of 14.5 percent (GDP calculation). The IT contribution to annual economic growth was calculated simply as the proportion of the annual change in IT industries' total value added over the total annual change in GDP. In 1990, value added of the IT sector was $347.0 billion or 6.0 percent of total GDP. In 1995, value added of the IT sector was $517.7 billion, accounting for 7.1 percent of total GDP, and 16.1 A1 - 27   percent of total economic growth. VALUE ADDED OF IT INDUSTRIES, ESTIMATES FOR 1996-98 In order to provide for more recent measurement of value added for IT industries, estimates were made based on projections of industry shipments provided in the ""U.S. Industry and Trade Outlook, `98"" (Outlook) jointly published by the Department of Commerce and DRI/McGrawHill. For each of the IT industries, estimates of shipments (sales), revenue, or receipts were taken directly or derived (for some IT industries, aggregate industry projections needed to be disaggregated to the IT level of industry detail) from the Outlook report. To arrive at the value added for the IT industries for 1996 through 1998, the projected shipments (from the Outlook) were multiplied by the average ratio of value added to either sales, revenue, or receipts, from the 1990 through 1995 value added data. In 1996, total value added of the IT sector was $571.1 billion, 7.5 percent of total GDP, and accounted for $14.6 percent of economic growth. In 1998, it is estimated that total value added of the IT sector will be $682.6 billion, account for 8.2 percent of total GDP, and account for 14.9 percent of total economic growth. VALUE ADDED OF IT INDUSTRIES IN REAL 1992 CHAIN WEIGHTED DOLLARS Nominal value added for IT industries were deflated to constant 1992 chain weighted dollars by using deflators calculated from BEA's published time series on GPO by industry (Table 8). Deflators were calculated by dividing the nominal dollar GPO by the constant dollar GPO for the appropriate industries in the IT sector. Deflators for computer manufacturing were provided separately. Nominal dollar value added of computer manufacturing was deflated using BEA's quality-adjusted ""hedonic"" regression deflators. The regressions relate prices of computer and peripheral equipment models to characteristics of those models, selected to represent factors related to the cost of producing the models. The resulting implicit chain-type deflators for computers and equipment (SIC 3571, 72, 75, 77) used in calculating the real value added of computers were: Year 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Deflator 1.353 1.203 1.000 0.839 0.750 0.593 0.418  A1 - 28   Table 8.

Instead, the wholesale trade and retail trade implicit deflators were used since these industries consist primarily of the wholesale and retail distribution network. The BEA also publishes quality-adjusted price indexes for semiconductors.25 However, to be conservative, the implicit GPO deflator for ""Electronic and other Electric Equipment"" was used for semiconductors. The following implicit GPO deflators were also used for the remaining IT industries: communications services deflator for the communications services industries; the electronic and electric equipment deflator for the communications equipment industries; the business services deflator for the software and services industries; the electronic and other electric equipment deflator for the IT electronics components industries; and the instruments and related products deflator for the IT instrument industries. IT contribution to real economic growth was computed using a methodology described in detail in BEA's May 1997 Survey of Current Business article called ""BEA's Chain Indexes, Time Series, and Measures of Long-Term Economic Growth"" by J. Steven Landefeld and Robert P. Parker. The box on page 63 provides a ""Note on Computing Alternative Chained Dollar Indexes and Contributions to Growth."" The methodology to compute real chain weighted dollar contribution to economic growth is not the same straight forward process used in determining contribution to growth for nominal dollars or if the real dollars would have been fixed. Basically, the chain-type weights require that growth from year-to-year for each of the IT industries' value added be rebased by moving the nominal value added for each of the industries by the change in the real value added. This basically sets each of the years as the base, or equal to 100, so that the difference between the nominal base and the calculated change is equal to the growth of IT industries. The rebased growth of IT industries was calculated in two ways and then averaged. First, growth for one year, say 1995, is based on the change in real growth (from the rebased nominal for 1995) to the next year, 1996. In this study, this is called the ""next year"" method. The changes in real growth from year-to-year, rebasing coefficients, are multiplied by the nominal value added (rebased so that each year equals 100.0) for each of the IT industries. The change from the nominal to the rebased change is the calculated change in the real. Second, growth for 1995 is also calculated on the change in real growth (again from the rebased nominal 1995) from the prior year, 1994. In this study, this is called the ""prior year"" method. The change in IT industries for both of these methods are averaged to derive a rebased change in IT industries for each of the years (Table 9). The contribution to real economic growth is then calculated as the total average change in the rebased IT industries over the annual change in real GDI (Table 10).

Real value added for IT industries for 1997 was estimated based on the relationship between nominal IT and calculated real IT for 1996. IT CONTRIBUTION TO LOWERING INFLATION Since GDI was used in this analysis to calculate the contribution to real economic growth, overall inflation was calculated from the implicit price deflator for GDI; i.e., an overall price index calculated as nominal GDI over real GDI (Table 11). The year-to-year change in the index is the annual change index. Nominal and real value added of IT industries are GDI. The index and the year-to-year change in the index inflation rate, using the implicit deflator for GDI, without in overall prices as measured by the subtracted from total nominal and real are recalculated to determine the overall the value added of IT industries.

BEA defines information processing equipment (IT equipment) to include: office, computing, and accounting machinery, communications equipment, photocopy and related equipment, and instruments. Estimates of IT equipment spending as a share of total business equipment spending were derived from inflation-adjusted investment expenditures on the above assets. BEA recently developed a new, chain-weighted deflation method which is preferable to the fixed-weighted deflators previously used because they allow for changes in prices and output A1 - 33   composition over time.26 However, chain-weighted estimates are not additive and it would be misleading to use the IT capital spending share to approximate a non-IT capital spending share. Also, BEA warns that chain-weighted estimates may lose some accuracy as one moves away from the base period and thus, may not be suitable for time series analysis. Industries that were considered heavy users of IT equipment were determined in two waysthe level of overall use of IT equipment relative to total equipment use and their IT investment per employee. (Tables 12 and 13) Fifty-three industries (exc. farming) were ranked according to both measures of IT intensity and the top 15 industries were designated as ""major users"" of information technology. Net capital stock is the cumulative value of past gross investment less the cumulative value of past depreciation. Total net capital stock of equipment includes non-IT industrial equipment, transportation equipment, etc. in $1987. Investment in IT equipment per employee includes annual purchases of IT equipment ($1987) divided by the number of workers in each industry. The most recent investment and net capital stock data by industry and by asset type are for 1994. BEA expects to release data for 1995 and 1996 in the spring of 1998. EMPLOYMENT TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS The employment numbers used in this analysis are from the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey, conducted monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in conjunction with state employment security agencies (Table 14). Private employment includes all full and part-time employees except those in the agricultural and government sectors. These data can be found at the BLS website (http://www.bls.gov). BLS also collects employment data through the Covered Employment and Wages (ES202) program, which are published annually in Employment and Wages, Annual Averages. When CES employment figures were not available at the necessary level of detail (4-digit SIC level), employment levels were estimated by applying the 4-digit SIC level employment distribution of the ES202 numbers to the aggregate (3-digit SIC level) CES numbers. When CES employment numbers were not available at the 3-digit SIC level, ES202 employment numbers were used. BLS publishes employment projections by industry to 2006, but mainly at the 2- and 3-digit SIC levels. Historical employment trends (1990 to 1996) were used to extrapolate employment demand of 4-digit industries to 2006. Five entire 2- or 3-digit industries were included among our list of IT industries -- computer and office equipment (357), electronic components and accessories (367), communications equipment (366), communications services (48), and computer and data processing services (737). For these industries, the projected employment levels were scaled to match officially published BLS projections. For the remaining industries, the unadjusted extrapolated employment estimates were used.

Readers interested in Census Bureau products issued from 1988 through 1993 should refer to Census Catalog and Guide: 1994, which provides a generally complete record of those years. The Census Catalog and Guide: 1997 also includes a number of guide features, such as a chart on product series in the Product Overview chapter and an extensive Sources of Assistance appendix. Chapters have introductions that provide key information about the censuses, surveys, and other programs that are the sources of data products described in the chapters. Most products are organized by subject into such chapters as agriculture, business, and foreign trade; but a special section combines references for the 1990 Census of Population and Housing. This volume offers many other aids to readers, including indexes to titles and subjects. The abstracts are numbered, and index entries generally cite the numbers of relevant abstracts. These numbers should not be used when ordering data products, though. The word ``New!'' appears above the title of any product which is, in whole or in part, new with this Catalog/Guide. A never-before-issued product will be flagged as new, and so will periodicals, new editions of earlier products, and series in which one or more new items have appeared. Symbols above a title indicate the form(s) in which a product is available: for a printed report or other paper copy, ; for a computer tape reel or tape a cartridge, a ; for a diskette (i.e., ``floppy disk''), a ; for a compact disc with ``read-only memory'' (CD-ROM), a ; and for a map, a .

As a catalog, it describes or lists the products (such as reports and machine-readable files) issued from mid1993 through 1996. (Information about those issued since 1996 appears in  To update bibliographic references in the Catalog/Guide, subscribe to the Monthly Product Announcement (MPA), the free publication which lists all Census Bureau products as they come out. MPA, Census and You (a monthly newsletter), and other useful Census Bureau reference sources are briefly described below. MPA lists all new Bureau products-- primarily publications and data files--and includes ordering information and order forms. Unlike the Catalog/Guide, the MPA does not describe every data product; it usually presents abstracts of one or two new ones, briefly describes several others, and lists the remainder. Each MPA covers products for a month and may be discarded when the annual Catalog/Guide including the period is published. No further reference to the February 1997 MPA (which covers December 1996) or earlier issues is necessary for users of this edition of the Catalog/Guide, since it reports on products released through December 1996. Data users may arrange to receive MPA free of charge by contacting Customer Services at the address or telephone number noted below. MPA and MPA-type listings of new products appear online, as discussed under ``Online Data,'' below. They also are available by E-mail subscription. (See abstract number 44.) Alternatively, users may subscribe to the Daily List, generally issued about three times a week, showing product releases each day and also what is sent to print. (See abstract number 15.5.) Census and You, a monthly newsletter issued by the Bureau of the Census, highlights new statistical findings and keeps data users informed about important new Bureau products, census and survey plans, and other program developments. Readers may subscribe to Census and You ($21 for 12 issues) through the Government Printing Office (GPO). To subscribe, use a GPO order form from the Ordering Products section and cite the List ID ``DUN.'' The record of Bureau of the Census publications from the first census to 1972 appears in the Bureau of the Census   2  INTRODUCTION  Catalog of Publications, 1790-1972. It is available from Customer Services for $8. Annual, noncumulative Census Bureau catalogs were issued during the balance of the 1970's. They are out of print but can be found in some libraries. The Census Catalog and Guide: 1989 covers the period 1980 through 1988. The 1994 edition covers mid-1988 through 1993. Copies of both, at $10 each, may still be available from Customer Services.

For information about the Catalog/Guide, call 301457-4501.  INTERNET A  CCESS  HOW  TO  O  RDER  Readers generally should order publications from GPO or its bookstores (see appendix B), and data files and technical documentation from Customer Services. Individual abstracts in this Catalog/Guide note the exceptions. Before ordering a product, though, it is always wise to check with Customer Service--a report may have sold out, a new edition may have been published, or some other change may have occurred that would affect your order. For more detail about ordering, see the Ordering Products section at the end of the Catalog/Guide. It is followed by copies of order forms. Use the GPO order form (form 3) to order publications or other products from GPO. Use the Census Bureau's publications order form (form 1) for most publications sold by the Bureau. Use form 2 for computer tape, compact disks, diskettes, technical documentation, and selected publications. The Ordering Products section also discusses maps sold by the Census Bureau. In addition, that section describes some convenient alternatives to the general rule that payments must accompany orders. For example, GPO offers a ``standing order service'' for advance orders of future editions of many publications. GPO fills such orders as soon as the publication is printed, often saving buyers weeks. See the discussion of the GPO standing order service in the Ordering Products section for details. Publication series available by subscription are described in abstracts and listed in appendix A. For information on availability and sale of products, call Customer Services, telephone 301-457-4100. Or visit ``CenStore'' at the Census Bureau site on the Internet (http://www.census.gov). For additional information on product content, contact the appropriate specialist (see the ``Census Bureau--Washington''  Data users interested in Census Bureau data online can access a wide selection of data at the Census Bureau's Internet site. Two other avenues for online access have been discontinued. They were CENDATATM and the Census/BEA (Bureau of Economic Analysis) Electronic Forum. The Census Bureau offers an Internet data site that provides access to product descriptions, the Monthly Product Announcement, and a wide cross section of data on subjects ranging from agriculture to industry to population. Figure 1 (page 5) presents the site's home page. All Census Bureau publications released by the Government Printing Office since January 1, 1996, as well as selected reports printed before that date are presented free-of-charge in the ``CenStats'' section of the Census Internet site. CenStats also includes a fee-based subscription service through which the Census Bureau offers certain special products and services that otherwise would be available only by purchasing CD-ROM's or by special arrangement. (See page 6.) The ``CenStore'' section of the site provides up-to-date descriptions, prices, and ordering information on Census Bureau products. The Census Bureau's Internet site can be accessed using these protocols: World-Wide Web: http://www.census.gov ftp: ftp.census.gov For specific technical questions, you may send E-mail to webmaster@census.gov or call 301-457-1242.  Reports by Agency,'' describes the programs of several Federal statistical agencies and highlights some of their data products. The information on Federal reports is followed by a list of Federal agencies with programs likely to be of interest to statistics users, provided by the Association of Public Data Users (APDU). APDU is an organization of users, producers, and distributors of Federal, State, and local government statistical data who are concerned about the availability, use, and interpretation of public data.

Connor, Chief Administrator, Division of Business and Economic Research, University of New Orleans, New Orleans, LA 70148; phone 504-280-3154; E-mail, apdudb@uno.edu.  Depository Libraries Depository libraries sponsored by the Federal Government are valuable sources for Census Bureau documents. These libraries are of two kinds. First are libraries that belong to the U.S. Government Depository Library System. They choose to receive (from the Government Printing Office) those Federal publications which they think their patrons will need. Of the more than 1,400 libraries now in the system, many receive at least some Census Bureau publications. An additional 130 libraries are of the second kind. They belong to the Census Library System. They are given selected publications by the Bureau to help make sure that reference and research collections are conveniently located for most people. The libraries in the two depository systems are listed in appendix B. Since some depositories have few Census Bureau publications, you should check with them before going.  Data/Information Centers The Census Bureau began the State Data Center program in 1978 to make statistical information more readily available to the public. The program now includes all States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The Bureau furnishes data products, training in data access and use, technical assistance, and consultation to the data centers. They, in turn, offer products and assistance to community leaders, planners, business people, and others. A State Data Center (SDC) usually includes a State executive or planning agency, together with a State university, the State library, or both, and several  OTHER SOURCES OF CENSUS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES Users may buy or refer to Census Bureau products and consult with specialists at locations throughout the country.

SDC agencies and affiliates are part of the ``Data/Information Centers'' list in appendix B. A number of States also participate in the Census Bureau's Business/Industry Data Center (BIDC) Program. Participants receive economic data and related assistance and training from the Census Bureau and other Federal agencies to further development in their States and to assist businesses and other users of economic data. BIDC affiliates include such organizations as chambers of commerce and small business development centers. (See the ``Data/ Information Centers'' list, appendix B.) The Census Bureau sponsors the Census Information Centers program, designed to give nonprofit organizations with a focus on minority concerns better access to census data. Participants receive relevant Census Bureau data and disseminate them to their member organizations and the public. For a list of participants, see the ``Data/Information Centers'' list in appendix B. For more information, contact the Customer Liaison Office (301-457-1305).  the TIGER/Linet files. (For more information about TIGER, see the Geography chapter of this Catalog/Guide.) As a service to TIGER users, the Census Bureau maintains an online list on its Web site of these vendors under the subject ``TIGER Vendors.'' Various data centers and clearinghouse organizations also offer TIGER-related services.  R C  ETURNS KEPT ONFIDENTIAL  Census Statistical Areas Committees Census statistical areas committees consist of local data users with an interest in the census statistical areas programs. These committees exist in all metropolitan statistical areas and some other counties. They recommend or approve the boundaries for such geographic statistical units as census tracts, census designated places, and census county divisions. For the name of the committee liaison in your area, contact the Bureau regional office nearest you. (See appendix B.)  Information collected by the Census Bureau from individuals, households, or firms is strictly confidential and may be used only for statistical purposes. By law (Title 13, U.S. Code) the Census Bureau cannot furnish copies of individual returns or issue any statistics which identify or disclose individual information. (See the next section for information on how to obtain official transcripts for such purposes as proof of age.) Confidentiality extends to names and addresses; thus the Census Bureau cannot supply lists of persons or firms reporting to it.  PERSONAL CENSUS RECORDS SERVICE Census staff will search the records of Federal censuses of population from 1910 on, stored at Jeffersonville, IN, and provide, for a fee, official transcripts of personal data to individuals who lack other birth or citizenship documents. Government agencies and employers often accept these transcripts as evidence of age and place of birth for obtaining employment, qualifying for social security benefits, and other purposes. Because of Census Bureau confidentiality requirements, the personal information recorded in these censuses may be furnished only upon the written request of the named individual or his or her legal representative. A fee of $40 covers the cost of making the search and certifying the results. Additional copies of the transcript are $2 each. A full census schedule providing further information recorded about the named individual(s), depending on the particular items shown in a specific census, costs $10 more per name, that is, a minimum total of $50. Application forms, with more detailed information, can be obtained by contacting the Personal Census Search Unit, Bureau of the Census, P. O. Box 1545, Jeffersonville, IN 47131; telephone 812285-5314.  International Trade Administration The U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration has Export Assistance Centers in many large cities. Furnishing services mainly for businesses, these offices keep reference libraries which include some Census publications. For a list of the offices, call 1-800-USA-TRAD.  Federal-State Estimates and Projections Programs The Federal-State Cooperative Programs for Population Estimates and Population Projections include participants in all States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Working in cooperation with the Census Bureau, the participants, normally associated with a State agency or university, prepare population estimates and population projections. For a list of participants, call 301-457-2422.  Census Bureau--Regional Information Services The Bureau's regional offices offer educational, inquiry, and reference services to organizations and the public. Information services specialists in the 12 offices (listed in appendix B) assist data users across the country. They furnish information about Census Bureau reports and data files and make presentations at workshops and conferences.  National Clearinghouse The National Clearinghouse for Census Data Services is a listing of organizations offering census data-related services and assistance. Organizations registered with the Clearinghouse offer assistance ranging from seminars or workshops to tape copies or extracts. They are not franchised, established, or supported by the Bureau. Each determines its own methods of operation, prices, and the clientele eligible for services. Contact Customer Services for a list of these organizations.  Census Bureau--Washington Training activities--The headquarters' staff does not currently offer training. There may be opportunities for training through Census Bureau regional offices. (See above.) Also State Data Centers sometimes offer training. Telephone consultation--The place to call for general information about products and how to order them is Customer Services (301-457-4100; TDD: 301-457-4611). Also, subjectmatter specialists from all areas of the Census Bureau may be consulted by telephone. See the ``Census Bureau-- Washington'' list in appendix B.  SPECIAL S  ERVICES  TIGERt Resource Vendors A number of private companies, universities, and other organizations have notified the Census Bureau that they offer processing and other services relating to the use of a computer-mapping database,  In addition to offering statistical products, the Bureau of the Census can provide special services on a costreimbursable basis. These services can be provided to the extent that (1) they conform to applicable law, (2) they do not interfere with the requirements of Census   4  INTRODUCTION  Bureau work authorized by direct appropriations, and (3) the requester reimburses the Bureau for all associated costs. The Census Bureau can conduct special censuses (discussed later). It also can perform such services as designing and carrying out sample surveys (including collecting data by mail or field enumeration), providing population estimates and projections, making special tabulations of data collected in censuses and surveys, and giving other technical assistance. Send inquiries concerning special services to the Director, Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233.  Conditions for Special Services Special tabulations or transcriptions of data--Special tabulations or transcriptions of data in the files of the Bureau of the Census will be undertaken on a cost basis, insofar as Bureau resources are available. Those requesting special tabulations should understand that the data are based on surveys paid for by public funds. The purpose for which such tabulations are obtained must not be contrary to the public interest or be used to give unfair commercial or other advantage to any person or group. All specially prepared or unpublished data furnished by the Bureau will be accompanied, so far as feasible, by appropriate statements on the limitations of the data. When the condition of the data warrants it, the Bureau may specify that the material is for the information of the purchaser only and may not be published or that publication of such material must be approved by the Bureau before publication. Parties interested in special tabulations should contact the Census Bureau's Customer Services at 301-457-4100 (TDD: 301-457-4611). Staff there will put requesters in contact with the appropriate subject-matter specialists to discuss details. A partial list of these specialists is included in appendix B. Special surveys for original data-- The Bureau of the Census will undertake projects that involve original collections of data on a reimbursable basis when the following conditions are present: 1. The Census Bureau has determined that the results are in the public interest. Before being undertaken by the Bureau, the survey must also be approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the Federal Reports Act. 2. An understanding has been reached between the customer and the Bureau concerning plans for publication or other uses of the data, to maintain appropriate standards of accuracy and quality, and to include qualifications or credits to protect the Bureau and the public interest.  Cost of Special Services To assure that the general public does not bear any of the cost of special services to private groups and individuals, customers are charged at cost for such services. Government agencies also are furnished services at cost. The cost of special services is determined on the basis of such factors as the quantity of data requested, the amount of work required to prepare the data, the complexity of data specifications requested, costs for personnel and equipment, and the medium (photocopies, computer tapes, and so forth) in which the data are made available, as well as planning costs and appropriate charges for overhead expenses. The charge for special services does not include the cost of collecting the data unless special questions have been added to a questionnaire at the customer's request or an entire survey is undertaken for the sponsoring organization.  3. An understanding has been reached between the customer and the Bureau of the Census with respect to the confidential nature of the information furnished by respondents. The individual returns from such surveys must remain the property of the Bureau. Special tabulations may be made available to public or private groups from such returns under the same conditions as for regular Bureau records. Individual returns will be considered confidential, as they are for similar Bureau surveys; that is, no information will be released which might disclose the activities or the identity of any persons or organizations without their specific written approval. The only exception occurs when the Bureau serves as a collecting agency for another government agency (Federal, State, or local), in which case the confidentiality of the information and publication rights are determined by the conditions under which the data are collected. Use of other special facilities--The Census Bureau may act as consultant to, or agent for, other groups on special statistical problems. The same requirements of public interest outlined above for special surveys for original data will govern where applicable.  SPECIAL C  ENSUSES  Priority of Work Priority in reimbursable work will be given to urgent work for matters of national interest, work for other Federal agencies, and work for State and local governments. Other work will be handled in the order in which it is accepted. It may be necessary, because of the pressure of higher priority work, to reject or reschedule projects.  Upon request, the Census Bureau conducts special population censuses for counties, cities, villages, townships, and school districts needing up-to-date census figures. The requesting governments pay all associated expenses. A special census can be conducted only with the authorization of the appropriate State or local government. For example, a countywide census must have the approval of the governing board of the county. A State or county can, however, contract to have a census taken for less than the entire jurisdiction. For more information about special censuses, authorized officials should write or call the Office of Special Censuses, Rm. 1685-3, Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233-5700, telephone 301-457-1429.   INTRODUCTION  5  Figure 1.

Compact Discs The Census Bureau is releasing most data files of the types described above on compact 4 3/4-inch, laser discs, called CD-ROM's (compact disc--read only memory). These discs can be used, with a suitable reader, on personal computers. Retrieval and display software is included on most CD-ROM's. The Census Bureau's new customized product, CountyScopeTM, also is provided on CD-ROM. CountyScopeTM brings together county and subcounty data (such as data for census tracts and ZIP Code areas) from a dozen separate products for the county or counties the user specifies and provides access with WindowsTM software. See the ad on page 46. CD-ROM's also can be prepared on request for data files otherwise available only on computer tape. Such CD-ROM's do not include software. See the Ordering Products section for more information.  Internet Access Many Census Bureau reports and other products, in full or in part, appear on the Internet. For more information, see ``Internet Access'' on page 2.  Printed Reports A great deal of data from censuses and surveys appears in statistical tables in printed reports and, occasionally, printouts and photocopies. Since the amount of data is massive and printing is expensive, the Bureau often issues data in greater statistical and geographic detail on computer tape and other electronic media than in print.  This chapter provides an overview of the numerous series of publications and other data products issued by the Census Bureau. It consists largely of a chart of several pages listing all the Census Bureau's product series. The chart, after listing general and reference sources, presents series by broad, alphabetically arranged subjects, such as ``Agriculture,'' ``Foreign Trade,'' ``Housing,'' ``Mineral Industries,'' and ``Population.'' The chart briefly describes each series and, if it is covered in this Catalog/Guide edition, gives its abstract number(s). Data users should refer to the chart if they want an overview of a Census Bureau program or a general idea of what the Bureau puts out on some subject. The chart helps readers screen out irrelevant references and select useful ones. To make sure a data product has the information needed, check the abstract or contact Customer Services. Users who are trying to locate a specific title or data on particular subjects, such as mobility, roof construction, or household characteristics, should start with the Title Index or Subject Index, respectively.  Computer Tape The Census Bureau issues extensive census and survey results on magnetic tape, a form that allows users with mainframe computers to handle large amounts of data efficiently. The tape is available on reels (``computer tapes'') and cartridges. (See the Ordering Products section for technical specifications.) The Census Bureau provides, on tape, these basic types of data files: Summary files (also referred to as ``summary tapes'') parallel many printed census reports with the same or more tabulations. For the population and housing censuses, summary files include considerable statistical and geographic detail not found in other census products. Public-use microdata files include records for unidentified individual persons, households, and housing units in a form that protects the confidentiality of the responses, but allows users to design their own tabulations. Geographic information is limited. Geographic reference files can be used to assign geographic codes to addresses, create maps by computer, build geographic information systems, and accomplish various other tasks.  Diskettes Some reports and data files appear on 3 1/2- or 5 1/4-inch diskettes--also called ``floppy disks''--for the IBM Personal Computer and compatible microcomputers. The data on diskettes are in a dBase format.  Maps The Bureau prepares outline maps with names and boundaries of areas for which it publishes data and statistical maps that, through color and shading, actually display data. Some maps appear in reports; others are sold separately.  C  ENSUS  G  EOGRAPHY  HOW DATA A PUBLISHED  RE  The symbols used below appear in the chart, beginning on page 9, and are used with abstract titles in other chapters.  The Bureau collects and publishes data for the governmental and statistical areas listed here. Those in italics are ones for which data are obtained only in decennial censuses of population and housing. For more information on geography and geographic products, see   8  PRODUCT OVERVIEW  figure 2 and the Geography section of the following chart. Also, see the Geography and 1990 Census chapters. Governmental areas: United States, Puerto Rico, and outlying areas under U.S. sovereignty or jurisdiction States, counties, and county equivalents Incorporated places (such as cities and villages) and minor civil divisions (MCD's) of counties (such as townships) Congressional districts and voting districts  American Indian reservations, associated trust lands, and Alaska Native Regional Corporations Statistical areas: Four census regions and nine census divisions, all of which are groupings of States Metropolitan areas Census county divisions (CCD's) in States where MCD boundaries are not satisfactory for statistical purposes Census designated places Urbanized areas Alaska Native village statistical areas Tribal designated statistical areas and tribal jurisdiction statistical areas  Census tracts and block numbering areas (BNA's)--Statistical subdivisions of counties. They have an average population of about 4,000. Census tracts are defined mainly in metropolitan areas, and BNA's are defined in counties without census tracts. Block groups (BG's)--Groupings of census blocks within census tracts and BNA's; tabulation BG's have an average population of about 800. Blocks--The smallest census geographic areas, normally bounded by streets or other physical features. They are identified throughout the country and have an average population of under 100.

Abstract numbers after the name of a product refer to relevant abstracts. (Generally, if a product was released before July 1993, it is not abstracted in this Catalog/Guide, so no abstract number is given. See the 1994 Catalog/Guide or call Customer Services, 301-457-4100, for information about such products.) The symbols following the abstract numbers refer to the product forms or media: printed report, computer tape, online, diskette, CD-ROM, and map. (Files on tape only can be transferred to CD-ROM by special arrangement with Customer Services.) Online access is noted when one or more of the reports in a series are available, in whole or in part, online via Internet (see page 2). The chart includes sections on the following subjects presented alphabetically following the General and Reference section: Agriculture; Construction; Economic--General; Economic--Outlying Areas; Financial, Insurance, and Real Estate Industries (FIRE); Foreign Trade; Geography; Governments; Housing; International; Manufactures; Mineral Industries; Population; Retail Trade; Service Industries; Transportation, Communications, and Utilities; and Wholesale Trade. Within each section of this chart, such as the Population section or the Agriculture section, series are generally divided into two broad categories: (1) censuses and other information usually released at intervals of several years and (2) current programs including annual and more frequent surveys and estimates. Specific years cited are the years for which the data were collected; the date of issue may be later.

It covers age, agriculture, and Asian Americans; it includes condominiums, crime, and capital costs. The reason for its variety? It describes reference guides and statistical anthologies, each spanning a myriad of social and economic facts. It also covers data reports--like the Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing, Mining, and  74  75 76  X-11.2 and X-11Q.2 Seasonal Adjustment Software ................... 77.5 9.3   24  (1)  GENERAL AND REFERENCE  Trade Corporations--that defy our subject arrangement by chapter. Overlapping inevitably occurs in other chapters, too. This chapter has three parts: the Economic Census, General Reference, and General Statistics. The Economic Census section describes both statistical and reference products, each based on various components of the 1992 census. The General Reference section describes reference sources, such as guides, without statistics--except to illustrate some point, in methodology, for example. By contrast, the General Statistics section covers sources that include statistics. The Statistical Abstract of the United States appears in the third section because it has statistics--even though it has bibliographies and directories, too. Guides, methodologies, and economic census files and reports that focus on only one subject appear in the chapter on that subject. For example, Maps and More: Your Guide to Census Geography is located in the Geography chapter. To find other references, see the Subject Index and the Title Index. You may also need to refer to other sources. The U.S. Bureau of the Census Library, Washington DC 20233, for example, provides microform for some Census Bureau statistics out of print for many years. In addition, there are other Federal sources of statistics. Appendix B contains a section entitled ``Federal Statistical Reports by Agency,'' which focuses on the most important printed sources. Also Federal agencies with statistical responsibilities are listed with addresses and telephone numbers under ``Other Federal Sources of Statistics'' in appendix B. The National Technical Information Service (703-487-4650) is a Federal source. It publishes geographic codes used with census data--the Federal Information Processing codes. It is also a good source not only for the latest computer tapes on technical topics but also for information out of print. The U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Business Analysis (202-482-1986), issues a quarterly compact disc covering many kinds of data, National Economic, Social, and Environmental Data Bank. Other Federal agencies and Congress issue statistics, too. See the last two sections in appendix B. In addition, the Government Printing Office (GPO) issues such reference series as: Government Depository Libraries (including addresses and telephone numbers not in the library list in appendix B of this catalog) Standard Industrial Classification Manual (and supplements)  Standard Occupational Classification Manual For GPO ordering information, see the Government Periodicals and Subscription Services, Price List 36, free from GPO (202-512-1800); guidance in the ``Ordering Products'' section at the end of this catalog; and the GPO bookstores listed in appendix B of this catalog. Many State governments publish their own statistical abstracts--and sponsor data center organizations noted in appendix B. ``Not-for-profit'' organizations and private firms also issue data. A visit to a large or specialized library may be the best starting point for identifying statistical sources outside the government. This chapter is mainly alphabetical by title, but various titles appear by series number or topic under Data Developments and U.S. Bureau of the Census-- Factfinder for the Nation. In this chapter, numbers in titles--1993, for example-- are alphabetized as spelled. For additional references, see the section below entitled Data Products Issued October-December 1996. Listings of subsequent releases appear in the Monthly Product Announcement and Daily List (see abstracts numbered 44 and 15.5, respectively). NOTE--The number above the abstracts makes the indexes easier to use. It should not be used for ordering products.  (1) Economic Census CD-ECON92-1I.

Counts have covered, for instance, military personnel--such as those on ships, civilian Federal employees, and their dependents. Occasionally, private citizens were also included. In some instances, the counts, assigned to ``home States,'' have been used for apportionment, though not for drawing legislative districts. In addition to legislative and statistical considerations, the report notes other concerns (such as the presence of military conflicts) that have influenced decisions on counting people overseas. The censuses have relied on administrative records, direct enumeration, or both, with the focus on the number of persons rather than their characteristics. 79 pp. 1994. $5.50 Contact Customer Services for the latest ordering information.

(77.5) X-11.2 and X-11Q.2 Seasonal Adjustment Software Subject content--Contains two seasonal adjustment programs that are based on the ratio-to-moving-average method. The programs develop a moving average smoothing of the original series as a preliminary estimate of the trend-cycle curve, compute ratios of the original series to the trend-cycle estimates to ``detrend'' the series, and estimate seasonal factors from these ratios. Both programs can adjust series that range from 3 to 30 years in length. The X-11.2 program, which is used to adjust monthly series, carries out several iterations of the ratio-to-moving-average procedure with a variety of options to aid in adjusting series with special characteristics. The X-11Q.2 program, which is used to adjust quarterly series, follows the same basic procedure as the X-11.2 program. NOTE--Through a recent improvement, both programs include a ``model-based'' smoothing option. Reference materials--Each order is accompanied, at no charge, by three documents: Supplement to Census Technical Paper 15: X-11.2: The Uses and Features of X-11.2 and X-11Q.2; X-11.2 Supplement: Namelist Variables for X-11.2 and X-11Q.2; and Sliding Spans Diagnostics for Seasonal and Related Adjustments.

Available from Customer Services.  Annual Capital Expenditures: 1994 ACE/94  GENERAL STATISTICS This section includes data products that provide statistics rather than reference information. However, in some instances, data products elude classification. The Census and You, abstract number 6.7, for example, is a newsletter that describes programs. But it also carries key data such as ``U.S. Statistics at a Glance,'' a monthly update of the economic indicators. (They also appear online, as described on page 2.) Also, conference papers, assumed to focus on programs and statistical methods, appear in the ``General Reference'' section of this chapter. Nevertheless, many papers include statistical tables. Statistical products in this chapter are compendia, bringing together information from varied sources. These include various parts of the Census Bureau and (for some products) other government agencies and private organizations. Statistical products that stress the subjects of particular chapters--business, for example--as a rule, appear in those chapters. This chapter also includes data from a particular census when combined with other data. For example, the chapter cites under ``Economic Census'' (beginning with abstract number 1.1) rather wideranging files that include, for instance, statistics on both retail trade and transportation. The present section ``General Statistics'' ranges even more widely, comprehending ``economics'' in a broad sense and including not only facts on particular industries and trades but also data on income and the labor force. ``General Statistics'' includes social data as well. For reports without statistics-- telephone contact lists, for example--see the ``General Reference'' section of this chapter. Each section lists titles alphabetically. America's Racial and Ethnic Groups: Their Housing in the Early Nineties See abstract number 482.3 in the Construction and Housing chapter.  U.S. Department of Commerce Economics and Statistics Administration BUREAU OF THE CENSUS  Subject content--Presents capital expenditures for new and used structures and equipment by private nonfarm companies with five or more employees and businesses with less than five employees (including nonemployers). For companies with 5 or more employees, capital expenditures data are published for 94 industries at 2-digit and selected 3-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code levels. For businesses with less than five employees, capital expenditures data are summarized, but no industry detail are available. Data presented in this annual publication are designed to improve the quality of monthly economic indicators of investments and planned investments. Improvements in these measures will contribute to improved quarterly estimates of gross domestic product. 54 pp. 1996. $5.

The census is the only source of detailed, complete, consistent agricultural data for each county; it also includes such data for the States and the United States. Agricultural statistics are used by government, business, and other institutions. Federal, State, and local agencies use data for planning rural development, extension work, and agricultural research. The Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and other organizations use agriculture census data, collected every 5 years, as a benchmark for such current statistical series as the Gross Domestic Product, Producer Price Index, and Farm Income Accounts. Congress uses census data in developing and revising farm programs. Farm cooperatives, commodity and trade associations, and agribusiness use the data to assist in locating new factories or service and distribution centers, allocating research funds, forecasting markets, selecting marketing areas, and making advertising and other marketing decisions. This improves farmers' access to markets and suppliers, too.  1978 census, a ``farm'' has meant any place that produced and sold (or normally would have sold) $1,000 or more of agricultural products for the census year. In addition to the census, a variety of related surveys have covered subjects such as irrigation, drainage, agricultural economics, and land ownership.  What Does the Census Cover? The first agriculture censuses of 1840 and 1850 asked farmers about livestock only in terms of the number of cattle, milk cows, and working oxen. The censuses also covered the production of Indian corn, pounds of cheese made, pounds of silk cocoons, gallons of wine produced, and other items. As the Nation's agriculture expanded westward, the acreage under cultivation grew. Also over the years, mechanization, specialization, and complexity increased. The scope of the census of agriculture also had to expand to keep pace with these rapid developments. The Census Bureau reviews the purpose, content, and necessity for the data in preparing every census. In recent years, the Bureau has asked only basic, essential questions of all farms, along with some other questions asked of about one farm in four. For 1992, the Bureau collected data in the 50 States on these main subjects: Acreage Crops Fruit and nut production Vegetables Nursery and greenhouse products Value of sales Farm related income Land use Irrigation, irrigation operations Type of organization Livestock and poultry Animal specialties Characteristics and occupation of operator Use of fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals Expenditures for interest, production items, and energy Machinery and equipment Market value of land and buildings  Censuses and Surveys The need for agricultural statistics has long been recognized. The Federal Government took a census of agriculture every 10 years from 1840 to 1920 and every 5 years from 1925 through 1974. Until 1950, the government took the censuses of population, housing, and agriculture together in years ending in ``0.'' From 1954 to 1974, the Bureau took a census of agriculture for the years ending in ``4'' and ``9.'' In 1976, Congress authorized a census of agriculture for 1978 and 1982 and for years ending in ``2'' and ``7'' after that. This made the agriculture census coincide with the economic censuses covering manufacturing, mining, construction, retail trade, wholesale trade, service industries, and selected transportation activities. The definition of a farm for the census has changed over the years. Since the  154  INTRODUCTION A farmer may never see an agriculture census publication, which might cover anything from crop acreage to interest expense. But complete and accurate agricultural statistics help ensure the orderly   48  AGRICULTURE  Figures 6, 7, and 8 are unavailable.   AGRICULTURE  (127) 49  Inventory figures cover December 31, 1992, and data on citrus crops are from the bloom of 1991. Generally, farms reported all other information for calendar year 1992. The content of the 1992 census is similar to the 1987 census, with more information on farm-related income, participation in Federal programs, and production costs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is assuming responsibility for the 1997 and future agriculture censuses.

With the 1992 Economic Census, the Census Bureau also is producing census data for the financial, insurance, and real estate industries. (Census data on transportation, communications, and utilities industries are presented in the separate Transportation chapter.) This chapter covers trades and services in the United States and outlying areas. Some products described here, like the County Business Patterns, also include statistics for other business activities, such as industrial and agricultural firms. Yet this chapter excludes data products for many firms ``in business''--the ``business of manufacturing,'' for example. Other chapters cover manufacturing, construction, foreign trade, mining, and other enterprises. Business statistics have numerous uses. The private sector uses them to forecast general economic conditions and to measure potential markets in terms of size, geographic areas, kinds of business, and kinds of products made or sold. Businesses also use the data to decide on   54  BUSINESS-- TRADE AND SERVICES  locations for new plants, warehouses, or stores; lay out sales territories; allocate funds for advertising; and analyze sales performance. The public sector frequently uses the data to plan, legislate, and administer policies based on statistical assessments of business activity. The data also are used in preparing composite measures, such as the gross domestic product, and as benchmarks for current surveys. To collect these data, the Census Bureau conducts economic censuses, periodic current surveys, and other programs. The Census Bureau has taken a census of business for each of the years 1929, 1933, 1935, 1939, 1948, 1954, 1958, 1963, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, and 1992. The data normally are collected during the first half of the year following the census year. Censuses for 1929 and 1939 made up part of the 1930 and 1940 decennial censuses; those for 1933 and 1935 were special projects. The census of 1933 was the first to include service industries. By current law, the Bureau of the Census conducts the economic census every 5 years for years ending in ``2'' and ``7.'' Retail trade, wholesale trade, and service industries have been treated as separate parts--indeed, separate censuses--of the economic census since 1972. Also, in 1972, use of the title ``census of business'' was discontinued. Another separate component was added beginning with 1992: the Census of Financial, Insurance, and Real Estate Industries. Business censuses at first covered only the 48 conterminous States, but included Alaska and Hawaii as territories in 1939, 1948, 1954, and 1958, and as States in 1963 and afterwards. The Census Bureau also took a census of business in Puerto Rico for 1939 and for 1949, and beginning with 1954, with each census thereafter. Since 1958, the census has covered Guam and the Virgin Islands of the United States, as well. Subject coverage has increased, too. Because of a major expansion in scope, the 1977 Census of Service Industries was the first such census not limited to ``selected'' industries. Also, as noted above, coverage of the financial, insurance, and real estate industries was added beginning with 1992. Current reports present results from surveys of retail, wholesale, and service industry trades. They include estimates of sales, inventories, and other economic measures. The reports are available monthly or annually. This chapter also describes data products from the enterprise statistics program and certain other economic census programs. These programs combine information from the business censuses and other  economic censuses, such as manufactures. Check the table of contents, above. For references to recent business data products, see the section entitled Data Products Issued OctoberDecember 1996 that follows this introduction. Listings of subsequent releases appear in the Monthly Product Announcement and the Daily List (see abstracts numbered 44 and 15.5).  drinking places; and miscellaneous retail outlets for sporting goods, drugs, and many other businesses. Sales Payroll Employment Legal form of organization Sales by merchandise category Other specialized data (for example, floor space, and number of gasoline pumps). Also every census year, a separate survey collects data on measures of value produced, capital expenditures, depreciable assets, and operating expenses. The results are published as part of the census Subject Series. Other surveys concentrate on monthly and annual sales, monthly and year-end inventories, and inventory-sales ratios.  Retail Trade Retail trade is the sale of merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption--plus services incidental to sales. Generally, the Census Bureau conducts the retail census and surveys by mail. The census covers all firms. But the Census Bureau spares most small businesses the trouble of filling out forms by relying on information obtained from a sample of them and from Federal administrative records. The Census Bureau typically collects statistics by establishment, a single physical location doing business. It groups the statistics by the kind of business, according to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. (The most recent retail census covers major groups 52 through 59 in the 1987 SIC system.)  Wholesale Trade Wholesale trade is the sale of merchandise to retailers and repair shops; to industrial, commercial, institutional, or professional business users; to farmers for farm use; to governments; or to other wholesalers. It also includes agents or brokers who buy merchandise for, or sell merchandise to, such clients or customers. Generally, the Census Bureau conducts the wholesale census and surveys by mail. The census covers all wholesale firms with employees; the surveys cover only a sample of the firms of merchant wholesalers (see types of operation, below). The Census Bureau typically collects wholesale statistics by establishment, a single physical location doing business. The Census Bureau considers the wholesaler's main product or group of products to determine the kind of business, according to the SIC code (in the major groups 50 and 51). The Census Bureau further identifies wholesalers by type of operation, according to the ownership of the business and the goods sold and to the character of the main transactions. The Census Bureau then groups the establishments for tabulation by one of three main types of operation: 1) merchant wholesalers, 2) manufacturers' sales branches or offices (but not their retail stores), and 3) merchandise agents or brokers. Wholesale trade also includes establishments that mainly sell to contractors, except for lumber, paint, and wallpaper stores which are classified as retail even if they sell primarily to contractors but are known in the trade as ``retail.''  Geography Census data on retail trade are prepared for the United States; each State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Island of the United States, and the Northern Marianas; metropolitan areas; counties; incorporated places of 2,500 or more inhabitants. Limited data are provided for ZIP Codes (see abstract number 2 in the General and Reference chapter). Most survey data are presented at the national level only. The Census Bureau also publishes limited survey results for some States, large metropolitan areas, and large cities in the Monthly Retail Trade Reports.  Subjects Covered in the Census and Surveys The census of retail trade covers such items as: Kind of business, including the following major categories: building materials, hardware, garden supply, and mobile home dealers; general merchandise stores; food stores; automotive dealers and gasoline service stations; apparel and accessory stores; furniture, home furnishings, and equipment stores; eating and   BUSINESS-- TRADE AND SERVICES  55  Geography Census data on wholesale trade are available for the United States; each State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, and the Northern Marianas; metropolitan areas; counties; and incorporated places of 2,500 or more inhabitants. Typical survey data are presented at the national level only.  Service Industries Service industries include those businesses which provide amusements, accommodations, education, repairs, and a host of other services. The Census Bureau conducted its first census of selected services in 1933-- though it asked about garages in the 1929 Census of Distribution and took a census of hotels for 1930. The Census Bureau also took censuses for 1935, 1939 (when it added Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii), 1948, and afterwards about every 5 years as part of the census of business. The Census Bureau began including Guam and the Virgin Islands of the United States in 1958 and the Northern Mariana Islands in 1982. The coverage of types of businesses broadened in 1977, so the Census Bureau dropped the limiting word ``selected'' from the title of the census. Generally, the Census Bureau conducts the census and surveys of services by mail. The census covers all firms. But the Census Bureau spares most small businesses the trouble of filling out forms by relying on information obtained from a sample of them and from Federal administrative records. The Census Bureau collects service statistics by establishment, a single physical location doing business, not (typically) by firm. The census groups the statistics by the kind of business, according to the SIC code, covering major groups 70 through 89.  Subjects Covered in the Census and Surveys The census of wholesale trade covers such items as: Kind of business including the following major groups for (1) durable goods: motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts and supplies; furniture and home furnishings; lumber and other construction materials; professional and commercial equipment and supplies; metals and minerals, except petroleum; electrical goods; hardware, and plumbing and heating equipment and supplies; machinery, equipment, and supplies; and miscellaneous durable goods; and (2) nondurable goods: paper and paper products; drugs, drug proprietaries, and druggists' sundries; apparel, piece goods, and notions; groceries and related products; farm-products raw materials; chemicals and allied products; petroleum and petroleum products; beer, wine, and distilled alcoholic beverages; and miscellaneous nondurable goods. Sales, by commodity category Payroll Employment Operating expenses Purchases Inventories Legal form of organization Type of operation Other specialized data (for example, storage capacity of petroleum bulk stations and terminals, and sales by class of customers). Also every census year, a separate survey collects data on measures of value produced, capital expenditures, depreciable assets, and operating expenses. The results are published as part of the census Subject Series. Other surveys concentrate on monthly and annual sales, end-of-month/yearly inventories, and stock-sales and salesinventory ratios.  repair services; amusement and recreational services, including motion pictures; health services, except hospitals; legal services; educational services, except elementary and secondary schools; colleges and universities, professional schools, and junior colleges; social services; membership organizations, except labor unions and political and religious organizations; engineering, accounting, research, and management services; and miscellaneous services. Federal income tax status (taxable or tax-exempt) Receipts and revenues Payroll Employment Operating expenses Size of establishment and firm Legal form of organization Other specialized data (such as sources of receipts and number of hotel rooms). Also every census year, a separate survey collects data on capital expenditures, depreciable assets, and selected operating expenses. The results are published as part of the census Subject Series. Other surveys generally concentrate on receipts.  Financial, Insurance, and Real Estate Industries The Census Bureau has expanded the coverage of the 1992 Economic Census to include for the first time the financial, insurance, and real estate industries. The census is collected by mail. All firms are included, but for those that are small, the Census Bureau relies on data obtained from a sample of them and on data from Federal administrative records. The Census Bureau collects the statistics by establishment, a single physical location doing business. It groups the statistics by the kind of business, according to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. (The financial, insurance, and real estate census covers major groups 60 through 67 in the 1987 SIC system.) The Census Bureau does not conduct surveys of these industries, at this time.  Geography Census data on most of the service industries subjects listed below include the United States; each State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, the Northern Marianas; metropolitan areas; counties; incorporated places of 2,500 or more inhabitants. Limited data are provided for ZIP Codes (see abstract number 2 in the General and Reference chapter). For the outlying areas, only selected industries are reported. Typically, survey data are presented at the national level only.  Subjects Covered in the Census and Surveys The census of service industries covers such items as: Kind of business, including the following major categories: hotels, rooming houses, camps, and other lodging places; personal and business services; automotive repair services and parking; miscellaneous  Geography Census data on the financial, insurance, and real estate industries are prepared for the United States; each State, the District of Columbia, and metropolitan areas.   56  (200 )  BUSINESS-- TRADE AND SERVICES  Subjects Covered in the Census The 1992 Census of Financial, Insurance, and Real Estate Industries covers: Kind of business, including: Financial. Depository institutions (central reserve institutions, commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, and related operations; foreign banking, and branches and agencies of foreign banks); nondepository credit institutions (credit agencies, personal and business credit institutions, and mortgage bankers and brokers); security and commodity brokers, dealers, exchanges, and allied services; holding companies; patent owners, investment companies; and mutual fund companies. Insurance. Life insurance carriers; accident and health insurance, and medical service plans; other insurance (including fire, marine, and casualty; surety; and title); managers of pension, health, and welfare funds; and insurance agents and service brokers.

A shrinking budget deficit, low interest rates, a stable macroeconomic environment, expanding international trade with fewer barriers, and effective private sector management are all credited with playing a role in this healthy economic performance. Many observers believe advances in information technology (IT), driven by the growth of the Internet,*1 have also contributed to creating this healthier-than-expected economy. In recent testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan noted, ""...our nation has been experiencing a higher growth rate of productivity--output per hour--worked in recent years. The dramatic improvements in computing power and communication and information technology appear to have been a major force behind this beneficial trend.""1 Some have even suggested that these advances will create a ""long boom""2 which will take the economy to new heights over the next quarter century. Other economists remain skeptical about the contribution of the IT industry to overall productivity. As yet, there is limited direct evidence in government data that investments in IT have substantially raised productivity in many non-IT industries.3 While the full economic impact of information impact is significant. IT industries have been economy-- a trend that is likely to continue. all business equipment investment. Declining inflation. technology cannot yet be precisely evaluated, its growing at more than double the rate of the overall Investments in IT now represent over 45 percent of prices for IT products have lowered overall  This report also begins a discussion about the potential impact on the economy of the Internet and electronic commerce. Recent rapid growth of the Internet is in part attributable to its strength as a medium of communication, education and entertainment, and, more recently, as a tool for electronic commerce.  * The Internet is a global matrix of interconnected computer networks using the Internet Protocol (IP) to communicate with each other. For simplicity, the term ""Internet"" is used throughout this paper to encompass all such data networks and hundreds of applications such as the World Wide Web and e-mail that run on those networks, even though some electronic commerce activities may take place on proprietary or other networks that are not technically part of the Internet. 1   Businesses in virtually every sector of the economy are beginning to use the Internet to cut the cost of purchasing, manage supplier relationships, streamline logistics and inventory, plan production, and reach new and existing customers more effectively. Cost savings, increased consumer choice and improved consumer convenience are driving growth in the sale of physical goods and in the digital delivery of goods and services via the Internet. Because the Internet is new and its uses are developing very rapidly, reliable economy-wide statistics are hard to find. Further research is needed. This report therefore uses industry and company examples to illustrate the rapid pace at which Internet commerce is being deployed and the benefits being realized. Examples showing the growth of the Internet and electronic commerce this past year are numerous:  Fewer than 40 million people around the world were connected to the Internet during 1996. By the end of 1997, more than 100 million people were using the Internet.4 As of December 1996, about 627,000 Internet domain names had been registered. By the end of 1997, the number of domain names more than doubled to reach 1.5 million.5 Traffic on the Internet has been doubling every 100 days.6 Cisco Systems closed 1996 having booked just over $100 million in sales on the Internet. By the end of 1997, its Internet sales were running at a $3.2 billion annual rate. In 1996, Amazon.com, the first Internet bookstore, recorded sales of less than $16 million. In 1997, it sold $148 million worth of books to Internet customers. One of the nation's largest book retailers, Barnes and Noble, launched its own online bookstore in 1997 to compete with Amazon for this rapidly growing online market. In January 1997, Dell Computers was selling less than $1 million of computers per day on the Internet. The company reported reaching daily sales of $6 million several times during the December 1997 holiday period. Auto-by-Tel, a Web-based automotive marketplace, processed a total of 345,000 purchase requests for autos through its Web site in 1996, for $1.8 billion in auto sales. As of the end of November 1997, the Web site was generating $500 million a month in auto sales ($6 billion annualized) and processed over 100,000 purchase requests each month.             If the trends suggested by this preliminary analysis continue, IT and electronic commerce can be expected to drive economic growth for many years to come. To realize this potential, however, the private sector and governments must work together to create a predictable, market-driven legal framework to facilitate electronic commerce; to create non-bureaucratic means that ensure that the Internet is a safe environment; and to create human resource policies that endow students and workers with the skills necessary for jobs in the new digital economy. 2   CHAPTER ONE: THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION  The Industrial Revolution was powered by the steam engine, invented in 1712,7 and electricity, first harnessed in 1831.8 Harnessing the power of steam meant less labor was needed for manual work; it also meant that factories could locate anywhere, not just in geographical areas with strong wind and water resources. Because it required a network to contain and transmit its power, electricity's potential had to wait until 50 years after it was first harnessed before the first power station was built in 1882.9 It took another 50 years before electricity powered 80 percent of factories and households across the country (Figure 1).10  Figure 1. Diffusion of Electric Power in the U.S., 1899-1939 100 90 80 Percentage diffusion 70 60 50 40 30 20  factories households  Early uses of electricity were limited. While factories used 10 generators for lighting, their 0 primary power still came from line 1899 1919 1929 1939 shafts and belt drives up to 1907.

It was not until factories replaced Source: David, Paul. ""The Dynamo and the Computer: An Historical Perspective on the Modern Productivity Paradox."" the old power system for electric motors that fundamental changes in production occurred. Factory structures were streamlined, and key processes, such as materials handling and manufacturing flows, were made more efficient.11 The digital revolution is happening much more quickly. The harnessing of light for nearly instantaneous communications and the ability to use microscopic circuits to process and store huge amounts of information are enabling this current economic transformation. In 1946, the world's first programmable computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), stood 10 feet tall, stretched 150 feet wide, cost millions of dollars, and could execute up to 5,000 operations per second. Twenty-five years later, in 1971, Intel packed 12 times ENIAC's processing power into a 12 mm2 chip with a $200 price tag.12 Today's personal computers (PCs) with Pentium processors perform in excess of 400 million instructions per second (MIPS). At the current pace of development, by 2012, PCs will be able to handle 100,000 million instructions per second.13 3   As late as 1980, phone conversations only traveled over copper wires which carried less than one page of information per second. Today, a strand of optical fiber as thin as a human hair can transmit in a single second the equivalent of over 90,000 volumes of an encyclopedia.14 By 2002, a constellation of several hundred satellites orbiting hundreds of miles above the earth is expected to bring high-bandwidth15 communications to businesses, schools and individuals everywhere on the planet. A global digital network using new packet switching technology16 combines the power of these remarkable innovations in computing and communication. The Internet ties together the computing power on desks, in factories and in offices around the world through a high-speed communications infrastructure. More than 100 million people around the world, most of whom had never heard of the Internet four years ago, now use it to do research, send e-mail to friends, make requests for bids to suppliers, and shop for cars or books. The Internet's pace of adoption eclipses all other technologies that preceded it. Radio was in existence 38 years before 50 million people tuned in; TV took 13 years to reach that benchmark. Sixteen years after the first PC kit came out, 50 million people were using one.17 Once it was opened to the general public, the Internet crossed that line in four years.18 Growing Economic Importance of the IT Sector: One of the most notable economic developments in recent years has been the rapid increase Figure 2. IT's Share of the Economy Grows in the IT sector's (computing and communications) share of 9 investment activity and of the 8.2 8 gross domestic product (GDP). 7 It grew from 4.9 percent of the 6.4 6.1 6 economy in 1985 to 6.1 percent 4.9 5 4.5 by 1990 as the PC began to 4.2 4 penetrate homes and offices. The 3 next spurt started in 1993, with 2 the burst of commercial activity 1 driven by the Internet. From 0 1993 to 1998, the IT share of the 1977 1980 1985 1990 1993 1998 economy will have risen from 6.4 Source: U.S. Department of Commerce Economics and Statistics Administration percent to an estimated 8.2 Estimates based on Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census data percent (Figure 2). With such rapid expansion, IT's share of total nominal GDP growth has been running almost double its share of the economy, at close to 15 percent. % of GDP  4   What makes this rise in IT's nominal share of the economy even more remarkable is the fact that IT prices, adjusted for quality and performance improvements, have been falling while prices in the rest of the economy have been rising. Computing power has been doubling every 18 months for the past 30 years. At the same time, the average price of a transistor has fallen by six orders of magnitude, due to microprocessor development. In just six years' time, the cost of microprocessor computing power has decreased from $230 to $3.42 per MIPS (Figure 3). No other manufactured item has decreased in cost so far, so fast.19  Figure 3. Microprocessor Prices Plummet from $230 per MIPS to $3.42 per MIPS in 6 years 250 230  200 $ per MIPS  150  100  50  50 16 3.42  0 1991 1994  1995  1997  Source: Intel  Year-to-Year Price Change* (%)  In 1996 and 1997, declining prices in IT industries lowered overall inflation by one full percentage point (Figure 4). Without the contribution of the IT sector, overall inflation, at 2.0 percent, would have been 3.1 percent in 1997.  Figure 4.

In recent years, IT industries have been responsible for more than one-quarter of real economic growth (Figure 5).20 % of Real Economic Growth  Figure 5.

In the 1960s, business spending on IT equipment represented only 3 percent of total business equipment investment. In 1996, IT's share rose to 45 percent (Figure 6). For some industries like communications, insurance and investment brokerages, IT equipment constitutes over threequarters of all equipment investment. Information technology supports high-paying jobs. In 1996, 7.4 million people worked in IT industries and in IT-related occupations across the economy. They earned close to $46,000 per year, compared to an average of $28,000 for the private sector. The impact of IT is also reflected in the capital IT firms currently represent. The collective market capitalizations of five major companies, Microsoft, Intel, Compaq, Dell and Cisco, has grown to over $588 billion in 1997 from under $12 billion in 1987,21 close to a fifty-fold increase in the space of a decade.

Growth could accelerate in the coming years not only in the IT sector itself, but across all sectors of the economy as the number of people connected to the Internet multiplies and as its commercial use grows. The growth will be driven by four types of economic activity:  Building out the Internet: In 1994, three million people, most of them in the United States, used the Internet.22 In 1998, 100 million people around the world use the Internet.23 Some experts believe that one billion people may be connected to the Internet by 2005.24 This expansion is driving dramatic increases in computer, software, services and communications investments. Electronic commerce among businesses: Businesses began using the Internet for commercial transactions with their business partners about two years ago. Early users already report significant productivity improvements from using electronic networks to create, buy, distribute, sell, and service products and services. By 2002, the Internet may be used for more than $300 billion worth of commerce between businesses.25 Digital delivery of goods and services: Software programs, newspapers, and music CDs no longer need to be packaged and delivered to stores, homes or news kiosks. They can be delivered electronically over the Internet. Airline tickets and securities transactions over the Internet already occur in large numbers. Other industries such as consulting services, entertainment, banking and insurance, education and health care face some hurdles but are also beginning to use the Internet to change the way they do business. Over time, the sale and transmission of goods and services electronically is likely to be the largest and most visible driver of the new digital economy. Retail sale of tangible goods: The Internet can also be used to order tangible goods and services that are produced, stored and physically delivered. Though Internet sales are less than 1 percent of total retail sales today, sales of certain products such as computers, software, cars, books and flowers are growing rapidly.        7   CHAPTER TWO: BUILDING OUT THE INTERNET  Where advances in telecommunications and computing largely occurred side-by-side in the past, today, they converge in the Internet. Soon, virtually all information technology investment will be part of interlinked communications systems, whether internal to a business, between businesses, between individuals and businesses, or individual to individual. However measured, the Internet is expanding at a very rapid pace. For instance, the number of Americans using the Internet has grown from fewer than 5 million in 1993 to as many as 62 million by 1997.26 UUNET, one of the largest Internet backbone providers, estimates that Internet traffic doubles every 100 days.27 The number of names registered in the domain name system grew from 26,000 in July 1993 to 1.3 million in four years. Over the same period, the number of hosts connected to the Internet expanded from under 1.8 million to over 19.5 million (Table 1). Table 1. Growth of Internet Hosts and Domain Names* (000s) # Hosts July 93 July 94 July 95 July 96 July 97 1,776 3,212 6,642 12,881 19,540 # Domains 26 46 120 488 1,301  * Internet host refers to a computer that is connected to the Internet that has a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address. A domain name represents a record within the Domain Name System. Source: Network Wizards http://www.nw.com  In January 1995, just over 27,000 top-level commercial (.com) domain names were assigned. Most businesses used them for little more than posting product and company descriptions, store locations, annual reports and information about how to contact corporate headquarters. Two and a half years later, commercial domain names number 764,000.28 Static brochures and bulletin boards are giving way to full-fledged businesses offering financial services, news and information, manufactured goods, and travel and entertainment to individuals and businesses. To meet this increased demand, consumer electronics companies, media giants, phone companies, computer companies, software firms, satellite builders, cell phone businesses, Internet service providers, television cable companies and, in a few cases, electric utilities, are aggressively investing to build out the Internet.  8   Hundreds of new firms are starting up around the country to help businesses use the World Wide Web effectively. They design Web sites and advertising banners, create Web-based catalogs, build security tools, create and track direct marketing campaigns, provide consulting services, and develop technology to speed the flow of data and information across the network. Venture capitalists gave just under $12 billion to hundreds of information technology start-ups in 1996 and 1997.29  Making the Internet Faster and More Accessible Households typically connect to the Internet through a PC and a telephone line. This method of access means that most households without PCs (just under 60 percent of all U.S. households30) do not have Internet access. It also means that most Internet connections from the home are slow.31 To illustrate the importance of speed, it takes 46 minutes to download a 3.5-minute video using a 28.8 kbps (thousand bits per second) modem, the modem most commonly used by households today (Table 2). Table 2. Time to Download 3.5-Minute Video Clip Using Different Technologies Transfer Time 28.8 Kbps modem 128 Kbps ISDN 4 Mbps cable modem 8 Mbps ADSL 10 Mbps cable modem 46 minutes 10 minutes 20 seconds 10 seconds 8 seconds  Telephone companies, satellite companies, cable service providers and others are Source: FCC, CS Docket No. 96-496, 1997; ADSL from Werbach working to create faster Internet 1997, p. 75. connections and expand the means by which users can access the Internet. New technologies such as ADSL (Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line) enable copper telephone lines to send data at speeds up to 8 million bits per second (mbps). At this speed, that same 3.5 minute video takes 10 seconds to download.32 PC manufacturers and software developers are also taking steps to make home computers cheaper and easier to use.33 Some PCs can now be purchased for less than $1,000 apiece. New network computers are expected to be introduced at prices of a few hundred dollars apiece. At the same time, new and enhanced software programs (for instance, better graphical user interfaces, search tools, and voice recognition technology) will make the PC and the Internet easier to use and thereby able to reach a broader community of consumers. Soon, many Americans will be using their televisions to access the Internet. Present in nearly every household, TVs are easy to operate and require little or no maintenance. Digital broadcasting services (high-definition television, or HDTV) will be available in the top ten markets by November 1999, and broadcasters are expected to make the transition to digital 9   broadcasting by 2006.34 With digital broadcasting, TV viewers will be able to interact with their televisions and surf the Web, pay bills, plan a weekend trip, or make dinner reservations. Already, satellite dishes and signals carried over cable television lines enable consumers to receive data from the Internet through their TVs and television programming through their personal computers. At speeds of 10 million bits per second, a household connected to the Internet via a cable modem can download a 3.5-minute video in 8 seconds.35 In most cases today, however, the outgoing communication (the speed at which the Internet receives the commands by the user) is still limited to the fastest modem speeds that copper telephone wires will support. Two-way cable traffic would be much faster, but only 9 percent of the 103 million cable subscribers in the U.S. and Canada (9 million homes) live in zones where two-way cable connectivity exists. And, only a small number of them--111,000--have actually subscribed to the service. By 2000, analysts estimate that two-way cable connectivity will be available to 34 million households, of which 1.6 million are expected to subscribe to the service.36 Cable operators are planning to make significant investments in the next few years to upgrade their systems to carry two-way Internet traffic. The wait for broadband Internet access to households is measured in years, not decades. Within the next five to ten years, the vast majority of Americans should be able to interact with the Internet from their television sets, watch television on their PCs, and make telephone calls from both devices. These combined services will be brought to homes by satellite, wireless, microwave, television cable and telephone lines, all interconnected in one overall system. People will also access the Internet away from their homes or offices. Cellular telephones and portable digital assistants (PDAs) have become very sophisticated devices capable of sending faxes, receiving e-mail and electronic pages, and now, accessing the Internet. Industry experts predict that users of cellular phones and digital personal communications devices will more than triple from 77 million to 251 million by 1999.37 Technology already exists to enable many appliances and consumer electronics devices to transmit and receive data. The first products to link home appliances with PCs should become available this year. Entering a simple message into a computer on a desk will be able to turn off the television or pre-heat the oven for dinner. Automobiles with video monitors will receive data from overhead satellites to warn about traffic jams, give directions to the nearest gas station, and deliver the latest news and information. The U.S. Government's FY 1999 budget calls for $850 million to be invested in high-performance computing and communications. As part of this effort, the budget provides $110 million for the Next Generation Internet Initiative, which will create a research network that is 100 to 1,000 times faster than today's Internet, and invests in R&D for smarter, faster networks that support new applications, such as telemedicine, distance learning and real-time collaboration.  10   Table 3. The Race to Build Out the Communications Infrastructure of the Internet During the 19th and 20th centuries, governments played a key role in helping build or actively regulate much of the country's transportation, communication and energy infrastructure powering the Industrial Revolution. Although the Internet originated in U.S. Defense Department research, private sector investments will largely drive its future expansion. Telecommunications: Manufacturers and software companies have been developing new technologies to allow higher-bandwidth communications across the existing copper network infrastructure, including DSL technologies, compression and faster electronic switches. Communications carriers around the world are building out fiber optic networks; technological advancements including optical amplification and new photonic switches make these high-speed networks more powerful and more efficient. Satellite: Satellite, telecommunications, electronics and aerospace companies plan to spend close to $27 billion to build out a global broadband network in the sky between 1998-2002 to reach most of the two billion people that live in areas around the world where phone service is unavailable. Cable: Thick cable wires pass more than 90 percent of U.S. households, piping in TV programming at speeds much faster than telephone copper carries voice traffic. Four years ago, many cable companies began to prepare the cable network for two-way Internet traffic, investing in fiber optic cable and set-top boxes to decipher voice, video and data sent in digital form. Wireless: Over time, wireless networks will be integrated with the Internet. Investments in satellites and repeater stations are now being made at a rapid rate to accomplish this. Cellular phones, pagers and hand-held computers will be able to transmit and receive voice, data and Internet traffic. Electric utilities: A number of utility companies around the country are beginning to lay thousands of miles of new fiber cable for Internet access at speeds ten times faster than today's high-speed phone connections.  As the number of Internet users grows, accessing the Internet becomes faster and easier to do, and as the number of Internet-enabled devices multiplies, the IT industry's share of the economy can be expected to continue to expand rapidly.  11   CHAPTER THREE: ELECTRONIC COMMERCE BETWEEN BUSINESSES  Internet commerce is growing fastest among businesses. It is used for coordination between the purchasing operations of a company and its suppliers; the logistics planners in a company and the transportation companies that warehouse and move its products; the sales organizations and the wholesalers or retailers that sell its products; and the customer service and maintenance operations and the company's final customers. Early computers were used for scientific and military purposes, not for commerce. They first made their way into commercial applications in the 1960s, with ERMA (the Electronic Recording Machine--Accounting). Banks were swamped with the growing volume of checks that needed to be processed (between 1943 and 1952, check use had doubled from 4 billion to 8 billion checks written each year). By automating the function with ERMA, the first bank to use the computer, Bank of America, reported that nine employees could do the job that previously took 50 people.38 The commercial use of computers quickly spread as companies in a variety of industries used them to keep accounting ledgers, administer payroll, create management reports, and schedule production. In the 1970s and 1980s, businesses extended their computing power beyond the company's walls, sending and receiving purchase orders, invoices and shipping notifications electronically via EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). EDI is a standard for compiling and transmitting information between computers, often over private communications networks called value-added networks (VANs). The 1980s also brought the introduction of computer-aided design (CAD), computeraided engineering (CAE) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems that enabled engineers, designers and technicians to access and work on design specifications, engineering drawings and technical documentation via internal corporate communications networks. The cost of installation and maintenance of VANs put electronic communication out of the reach of many small and medium-sized businesses. For the most part, these businesses relied on the fax and telephone for their business communications. Even larger companies that used EDI often did not realize the full potential savings because many of their business partners did not use it. The Internet makes electronic commerce affordable to even the smallest home office. Companies of all sizes can now communicate with each other electronically, through the public Internet, networks for company-use only (intranets) or for use by a company and its business partners (extranets), and private value-added networks. Companies are quickly moving to utilize the expanded opportunities created by the Internet. For instance, Cisco Systems, Dell Computers and Boeing's spare parts business report almost 12   immediate benefits after putting their ordering and customer service operations on the Internet. They are so convinced of its benefit to their own companies and their customers that they believe most of their business will involve the Internet in the next three to five years.39 Although still in an embryonic stage, analysts predict businesses will trade as much as $300 billion annually over the Internet in the next five years.40 Some believe the volume of Internet commerce will be much higher. As statistically valid sampling data are not yet available, determining the actual growth rate is very difficult to do. This report does not attempt to size the current market or predict the size of the future market. Instead, it describes the underlying drivers of growth of business-to-business electronic commerce, using specific company and industry examples as illustrations. Growth of business-to-business electronic commerce is being driven by lower purchasing costs, reductions in inventories, lower cycle times, more efficient and effective customer service, lower sales and marketing costs and new sales opportunities.  LOWER PURCHASING COSTS Buying materials or services for a corporation can be a complex, multi-step process. First, purchasers have to find suppliers who make the product and determine whether they meet volume, delivery, quality and price requirements. Once a potential supplier has been chosen, detailed drawings and information are transmitted to the supplier so that the product is built to exact customer specifications. Assuming the product sample has been approved and the supplier's manufacturing lines are ready for production, the buyer then transmits a purchase order (P.O.) for a specific quantity of goods. The buyer, meanwhile, receives notification from the supplier that the P.O. was received and confirmation that the order can be met. When the product ships from the supplier, the buyer again receives notification, along with an invoice for goods delivered. The buyer's accounting department matches the invoice with the P.O. and pays the invoice. When changes to the normal order happen--a frequent occurrence in most companies--the process can be much more complicated. Companies lower procurement costs by consolidating purchases and developing relationships with key suppliers to benefit from volume discounts and tighter integration in the manufacturing process. They also cast a wide net for lower-cost sources of supply. Large companies have been using EDI over private networks to reduce labor, printing and mailing costs in the procurement process. Automating routine procurement means the procurement staff has more time to focus on negotiating better prices and building supplier relationships. Analysts estimate that businesses already trade well over $150 billion in goods and services using EDI over VANs.41 Companies using EDI commonly save 5-10 percent in procurement costs.42 The Internet has the potential to further reduce procurement costs. Large companies benefit from lower transmission costs versus private networks. The Internet also opens the door to doing 13   business electronically with new suppliers and with small and medium-sized suppliers who formerly communicated only via fax or phone. Small companies also benefit. The Internet reduces processing costs and opens up new sales opportunities from potential buyers that post requests for bids on the Internet. Procurement via the Internet is new enough that projecting economy-wide savings or other benefits is difficult. Specific company examples suggest that its potential is large and growing. For instance, General Electric's lighting division reports significant gains in responsiveness, improved service, and reduced labor and material costs as a result of shifting purchasing from a largely manual system to an electronic one using Internet protocols. Factories at General Electric's lighting division used to send hundreds of requisitions for quotes (RFQs) to the corporate sourcing department each day for low-value machine parts. For each requisition, the accompanying blueprints had to be requested from storage, retrieved from the vault, transported on site, photocopied, folded, attached to paper requisition forms with quote sheets, stuffed into envelopes and mailed out. The process took at least seven days and was so complex and time-intensive that the sourcing department normally only sent out bid packages to two to three suppliers at a time. In 1996, GE Lighting piloted the company's first online procurement system, TPN Post, an extranet developed by GE Information Services. Now, the sourcing department receives the requisitions electronically from its internal customers and can send off a bid package to suppliers around the world via the Internet. The system automatically pulls the correct drawings and attaches them to the electronic requisition forms. Within two hours from the time the sourcing department starts the process, suppliers are notified of incoming RFQs by e-mail, fax or EDI. A bid can be evaluated and awarded the same day GE receives it. Previously, more than one them with purchase orders beginning to end, invoices modifications that happen out of four invoices had to be investigated and ""reworked"" to reconcile and receipts. With the transaction handled electronically from are now automatically reconciled with purchase orders, reflecting any along the way.  According to GE, the division's labor costs for procurement have declined by 30 percent. Sixty percent of the procurement staff have been redeployed. The sourcing department has at least six to eight additional days a month to concentrate on strategic activities rather than the paperwork, photocopying and envelope stuffing it had to do when the process was manual. Material costs have declined by up to 20 percent as the ability to reach a wider base of suppliers online created more competition and led to lower prices. As of October 1997, eight divisions of General Electric use TPN for some of their procurement. The company bought more than $1 billion worth of goods and supplies via the Internet in 1997. By 2000, GE aims to have all 12 of its business units purchasing its non-production and maintenance, repair and operations materials (MRO) via the Internet, for a total of $5 billion. GE 14   estimates that streamlining these purchases alone could save the company $500-$700 million over the next three years.43 Other companies report plans to use the Internet for procurement. One out of four purchasing managers expects to use the Internet for MRO purchases, up from 10 percent who use it for that purpose today.44  REDUCED INVENTORY/THE RIGHT PRODUCTS IN STOCK The longer it takes for production schedules to reach suppliers, the more inventory a company has to hold to account for delays and errors, and the less quickly it can react to changes in demand. The more inventory a company holds, the higher its operating costs, and the lower its profits. Carrying more inventory does not ensure better customer service, either. Shelves weighed down with size-10 running shoes do not help the customer who wears a size 8. When a customer enters a furniture showroom looking for an armchair with green and white stripes and is told it's on back-order for 12 weeks, he may drive across town to a competitor rather than wait. Managing inventory properly results in better service for the customer and lower operating costs for the company. Increasing the frequency of inventory ""turns"" (the number of times inventory in existing warehouse or store space is sold or used for production each year) reduces inventoryrelated interest, handling and storage costs. Reducing inventory levels also means that existing manufacturing capacity is more efficiently utilized. More efficient production can reduce or eliminate the need for additional investments in plant and equipment. IBM's Personal Systems Group provides an illustration of how the Internet and private networks are helping companies keep stocks of inventory smaller, yet more targeted on likely consumer needs. Each month, the group's marketing departments report information on how many PCs they think will be sold. The production planning departments identify manufacturing and materials capacity in each factory. Armed with inputs from across the company on demand and supply, production schedules are assigned to each factory. The procurement staff uses the same information to negotiate with suppliers. As new information comes in each week, the process is repeated and the production schedule fine-tuned. Electronic communication between factories, marketing and purchasing departments have made this quick response possible. Problems are communicated as they arise and the appropriate adjustments are made. If demand suddenly rises or if one factory cannot meet its production schedule, IBM is aware of it in time to increase production at another factory. The Personal Systems Group has been phasing in this Advanced Planning System (APS) since 1996 and already reports significant results. During the first year of APS, inventory turns 15   increased 40 percent over the previous year, and sales volumes increased by 30 percent. The group anticipates another 50 percent increase in turns and a 20 percent increase in sales volume in 1997. By better utilizing its existing manufacturing capacity, IBM has avoided having to make additional investments to meet the increased volume requirements. The lower investment and operating costs due to improved inventory turns have resulted in savings of $500 million. IBM is not alone in its efforts to use networks to improve communication between the marketing and sales arm of a business and its production units. Manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers are working together to form standards and guidelines for better forecasting and restocking called Collaborative Planning Forecasting Replenishment (CPFR). These standards will allow companies to collaborate in determining future demand for products and to share information about the availability of products in stock. With CPFR, a retailer and its supplier electronically post their latest sets of forecasts for a list of products. A server tied to the Internet compares the forecasts and flags differences in those that exceed a normal safety margin--say 5 percent. Differences are then reconciled by planners at both the retailer and the supplier. To keep that process from becoming too cumbersome, software companies are working to develop programs that automatically handle exception messages based on rules that apply to that business.45 The accounting and consulting firm Ernst & Young believes that CPFR could yield an inventory reduction of $250 billion to $350 billion across the economy. By reducing inventory levels, businesses will realize substantial savings in materials handling, warehousing, and general administrative costs.46  LOWER CYCLE TIMES Cycle time is the total time it takes to build a product. There are certain fixed costs associated with building any product that do not vary with the amount of production, but rather are time dependent. These ""fixed"" costs include depreciation of equipment, most utility and building costs, and most managerial and supervisory time. If the time to build a product can be reduced to seven days instead of ten, then the fixed costs per product are lower since less time was needed. Electronic commerce allows ""cycle times"" to be shortened, allowing more to be produced for the same or lower costs. In the 1980s, the lower cycles times realized by Japanese companies presented American companies with a serious competitive challenge. They responded by breaking down organizational barriers that had grown up between design, manufacturing and sales divisions and improving communications with external partners. Establishing electronic links with their large suppliers and customers enabled companies to transmit and receive purchase orders, invoices and shipping notifications with much shorter lead times than previously. Some also began to share product specifications and drawings over valueadded networks to speed product design and development.  16   The Internet will permit even further reductions by broadening the network of businesses connected electronically and by facilitating collaboration on projects across work teams and geographical locations. Few industries faced a greater challenge to reduce cycle times than the automotive industry in the early 1980s. While Japanese automakers could take a car from concept to mass production in approximately three years, American companies typically took four to six years. First, a full-scale clay model was built to see how the vehicle would look in real life. Incorporating changes to the model could take months. Once approved, single- or multipleprototype vehicles were built by hand to see whether parts fit together correctly and whether the car could be built economically. Engineers worked with the prototype builders to refine the engineering specifications. Once the prototype was ready, the engineers would design the individual components and the tooling needed to make the components. Then, purchasing agents would work with suppliers to produce prototype tooling and parts for assembly of pilot or preproduction vehicles. If everything went smoothly, the manufacturing-engineering team would then assemble the vehicle to discover any assembly problems. Finally, after additional modifications, the vehicle was mass produced.47 Today, all parties involved in designing a new platform or vehicle--designers, engineers, suppliers, and manufacturing and assembly personnel--work as part of a team, contributing to the process from beginning to end. As a result of computerization, steps that used to take weeks or months can now be done in a matter of days. Sharing information electronically allows the different members of the group to work on projects together, rather than having to wait for each member to finish his step before the next one can be taken. Through the use of computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and computer-aided engineering (CAE), the whole team can share computer files and use 3-D modeling techniques to design the vehicle and see how parts fit without building prototypes by hand. Changes to the components can be made without building sample tooling and parts. When the final design is agreed on, CAM data is loaded into machines that build the tooling and prototype parts. The same techniques are being used to reconfigure and retool assembly plants. Working as a team and sharing information electronically has cut the time it takes to develop and build a new vehicle to about 30 months.48 Automotive companies now want to shorten the design cycle to less than 24 months by setting up platform teams in different parts of the world and linking them electronically. By using global communication links, engineers in Detroit can assign a problem to engineers on their team in India. With the time zone difference, the engineers in the Far East can work on the problem and get an answer back to their Detroit counterparts by the next business day.49 Cycle times are also being shortened for production. Before the use of EDI, automotive companies communicated production requirements and schedules to their suppliers by phone, fax or mail. This meant time-consuming manual data entry, photocopying and information hand-offs 17   from one supplier to another. It could take several weeks to get the manufacturing schedule and requirements to all component factories and vendors. To minimize the impact of delays and errors caused by miscommunication, the assembly plant kept a large inventory of parts on-hand. Today, automobile manufacturers and their large suppliers communicate production and scheduling requirements via EDI. The assembly plant electronically sends the supplier an 8- to 12-week forecast or build plan. Daily production requirements detailing the number of parts needed at each plant at specific scheduled times are also communicated electronically. When the parts are ready and loaded in the trailer, the supplier notifies the assembly plant that the parts are on their way. The plant schedules its lines to coincide with the arrival of the trailers. By changing its assembly process to take advantage of the more accurate and timely information they receive electronically, most North American assembly locations turn inventory 130 times per year, up from 7 to 10 times per year in the past.50 In January 1994, Chrysler, Ford, GM, Johnson Controls and 12 of their suppliers began working together as part of the Manufacturing Assembly Pilot (MAP) to further improve material flow within a pilot four-tier seat assembly supply chain. At the project's outset, it took four to six weeks for material release information to reach the bottom of the supply chain. Along the way, information was distorted and truncated. The resulting late, inaccurate and untrusted information cost millions of dollars in the form of ""just-in-case"" inventories, premium freight, unplanned setups and changeovers, and other inefficiencies. By electronically connecting the MAP participants, production schedules reached the bottom of the supply chain in less than two weeks. On-time shipments improved 6 percent. Error rates were reduced by 72 percent. Up to eight hours per week per customer was saved in labor costs. Connecting all levels of suppliers through the entire industry via EDI could save nearly $1.1 billion annually--a cost savings of $71 or more per car--and decrease information lead-time to just one day between each tier of the supply chain.51 The automotive industry is now investing in a new venture, the Automotive Network Exchange (ANX), a managed ""virtual private network"" that runs over the Internet and links manufacturers and suppliers worldwide. ANX will electronically link those suppliers who still communicate to the automotive manufacturers by fax, phone and mail. And, it will replace the thousands of direct dial connections with a single network, considerably lowering the transmission costs borne by the manufacturers and the suppliers. Scheduled to be fully implemented by 2000, the network will electronically route product shipment schedules, CAD files for product designs, purchase orders, payments and other business information. Participating automobile manufacturers believe that ANX has the potential to reduce the product development and manufacturing cycles even further, as well as improve many other key business processes. The results achieved by the auto industry through EDI can be, and are being, replicated in many other industries. Because of its low cost and ease of use, the Internet will help accelerate the pace at which businesses communicate with each other electronically and the benefits they can realize. 18   MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE Companies are beginning to use the Internet for customer service. Having product descriptions, technical support and order status information online not only saves money by freeing up a company's own customer service staff to handle more complicated questions and manage customer relations, it can also lead to more satisfied customers. Companies have long gathered and stored information about customers and products in databases that only certain authorized employees can access. Innovative businesses are finding ways to tap the potential of that information, making it available to those who need it most--whether it's a customer service representative answering a phone call or a customer looking for account information or technical support online. Few things are more frustrating to a customer than uncertainty about when an important purchase will arrive. Too often, phone calls to a supplier result in a series of transfers from one department to another and an eventual promise to check on the status of the order and to call the customer back. This pattern consumes time and money for the customer and the seller. Delivery companies are helping their business partners solve this problem via the Internet. A customer can go to the company's Web site, enter his order number, and find out that the product is already on a FedEx or a UPS truck and is expected to arrive the next morning. This information can be retrieved from the company's Web site in less than a minute. In addition to improved customer satisfaction, companies using the Internet for customer service report savings from putting order tracking, software downloads and technical support information online. For instance, Cisco reports that its customer service productivity has increased by 200 to 300 percent, resulting in savings of $125 million in customer service costs. Dell estimates that it saves several million dollars a year by having basic customer service and technical support functions available on the Internet.  LOWER SALES AND MARKETING COSTS An individual sales person can support as many customer accounts as he can physically visit or contact by telephone. Therefore, as the number of accounts increases, so does the size of the sales force. Even direct marketing companies increase staffing as telephone order volume increases. By contrast, a Web business can add new customers with little or no additional cost. Because its sales function is housed in a computer server rather than physical store locations or sales people, its reach is bounded only by the capacity of the servers to respond to inquiries and orders. The Internet can also make traditional sales organizations, layered distribution channels, catalog sales and advertising more efficient. With automated ordering capabilities, sales representatives no longer have to prepare time-consuming manual orders. Instead, they can spend time building 19   and maintaining customer relationships. Electronic catalogs present far more information and options than their paper counterparts. Direct marketing online can shorten repurchase cycles and increase the ability to sell additional items. Some recent business examples suggest the potential of the Internet as an efficient sales tool. Boeing's spare parts business debuted its PART Page on the Internet in November 1996, allowing its airline customers around the world to check parts availability and pricing, order parts, and track the status of their orders. Less than a year later, about 50 percent of Boeing's customers use the Internet for 9 percent of all parts orders and a much larger percentage of customer service inquiries. The Boeing spare parts business processes about 20 percent more shipments per month in 1997 than it did in 1996 with the same number of data entry people. And, because customers can satisfy many service requests online, as many as 600 phone calls to customer service representatives are avoided each day. Cisco builds virtually all its products (routers, switches and other network interconnect devices) to order, so there are very few off-the-shelf products. Before the company established an Internet sales capability, ordering a product could be complicated. Generally, an engineer at the customer site knew what type of product was needed and how it should be configured. The engineer communicated this information to his procurement department who then created the purchase order and sent it to Cisco via fax, phone or e-mail. A Cisco customer service administrator entered the order into Cisco's system. If the order went through ""clean"", it would be booked and production scheduled within 24 hours. Nearly one out of four orders didn't get a ""clean"" bill of health, however. Instead, when Cisco's system tried to validate the order, it discovered an error in how the product was configured. The ""dirty"" order would be rejected, the customer contacted and the procurement cycle would begin again. In July 1996, Cisco rolled out its Web-based ordering and configuring system. Today, that same engineer can sit down at a PC, configure the product online, know immediately if there are any errors, and route the order to the procurement department. Because the customer's pricing structure is already programmed into the Cisco site, the authorized purchaser can complete the order with a few keystrokes. And, rather than calling Cisco to find out the status of the order, invoice or account information, a customer with the proper authorization can access the information directly on the Web site. With the online pricing and configuration tools, about 98 percent of the orders go through the system the first time, saving time both at Cisco and the customer's site. Lead times have dropped two to three days, and customers' productivity has increased an average of 20 percent per order.  NEW SALES OPPORTUNITIES The Internet operates around the clock and around the world. As a result, businesses on the Web can reach new markets they could not reach effectively with an in-person sales force or advertising campaigns. 20   For instance, a plastics commodity specialist at a large manufacturer can sit down at his PC, click on a Web browser and search for suppliers selling industrial plastics online. A small supplier with a limited sales force can now reach that buyer, getting its first introduction online. Similarly, a vendor's sales force may not be able to reach the millions of home offices and small offices around the country. By having an online presence and creating customized services for the small business market, that vendor may develop a new, lucrative market, both within the U.S. and globally. Companies using the Internet to sell products find that they attract new customers. For example, eighty percent of the consumers and half of the small businesses who purchased from Dell's Web site had never purchased from Dell before. One out of four say that if not for the Web site, they would not have made the purchase. And, their average purchase value is higher than Dell's typical customer. W.W. Grainger, the leading distributor of MRO supplies in North America, describes similar results. The company launched its Web business in the spring of 1995. Today, more than 30 percent of the company's online sales are to new customers or incremental sales to existing customers. Because the virtual store is open seven days a week, 24 hours a day, customers who wouldn't otherwise be able to order from a Grainger store are now able to do so. In fact, more than 50 percent of all orders are placed after 5 PM and before 7 AM when the local store is closed.  THE FUTURE Businesses that use the Internet to buy, sell, distribute and maintain products and services are realizing significant cost savings and increased sales opportunities. And, the benefits only increase as the network of businesses conducting electronic commerce grows. Investments are already taking place to realize the $300 billion in business-to-business Internet commerce analysts predict by 2002.52 Three of the companies discussed in this chapter--Cisco, Dell and General Electric--were responsible for about $3 billion in Internet commerce in 1997. If their current projections prove accurate, these three companies alone will conduct more than $17 billion in Internet commerce within three to five years.53 The experiences of these and other companies are quickly spreading through the rest of U.S. industry through conferences and consulting firms who assist companies to design and implement Internet-based business solutions. Even at $300 billion, Internet commerce will only represent 3 percent of total GDP.54 This means that the greater efficiencies companies are experiencing from electronic commerce are likely to continue to diffuse through the U.S. economy for decades to come. Meeting legal and technical hurdles Businesses have raised three potential inhibitors to the widespread adoption of Internet commerce: the lack of a predictable legal environment, concerns that governments will overtax the Internet, and uncertainty about the Internet's performance, reliability and security. 21   For a business to feel comfortable about using the Internet in communications with its suppliers and customers, it needs to be sure of the identity of the party at the other end of the transaction and that any agreement made electronically is binding. Today, a business verifies identities with passwords, electronic signatures and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Initiatives are currently underway to develop a more effective system of digital certification and authentication. The U.S. Government is promoting the development of an international convention to legally recognize digital authentication. The U.S. government also supports the development of both a domestic and global uniform commercial legal framework that will recognize, facilitate and enforce electronic transactions worldwide. Internationally, the U.S. government is working with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) which has completed work on a model law that supports the commercial use of international contracts in electronic commerce. The government is also encouraging the work of the International Chamber of Commerce which has issued model commercial code guidelines. Companies are also concerned about the potential for excessive taxation of the Internet. The U.S. Government believes that no new discriminatory taxes should be imposed on Internet commerce. It also believes that no customs duties should be imposed on electronic transmissions. The application of existing taxation on commerce conducted over the Internet should be consistent with the established principles of international taxation, should be neutral with respect to other forms of commerce, should avoid inconsistent national tax jurisdictions and double taxation, and should be simple to administer and easy to understand. Some companies express conduct EDI transactions information will arrive at network service provider concern about the Internet's current technical limitations. Those who over VANs have the confidence and experience that important its destination, on schedule, intact. If any problems do arise, a single is accountable and responsible for resolving them.  Companies expecting this level of service worry that the Internet offers no such guarantees. Because it is a public network that connects many smaller, interconnected networks and service providers, there is no single entity responsible for ensuring that a message leaves one point and arrives, intact, at another. And, because companies have a need to transmit confidential information, they want assurance that it remains secure. Companies are taking different approaches to address the current technical limitations. Some use the Internet to purchase lower-value, indirect materials while keeping their higher-value, direct material purchases over VANs. Some rely on extranets, or ""virtual private networks,"" that limit access to a certain pre-qualified set of businesses and their partners. Sophisticated encryption products and firewalls are being used by some companies to protect privacy and ensure the security of Internet transactions. Many others await a resolution of current export limitations on encryption software before they plan to increase their Internet business. 22   The automotive industry's ANX is an example of an extranet that will provide automotive trading partners with a single, secure network for electronic commerce and data transfer. The industry has created a management structure and business rules to ensure that the network meets the performance, reliability and security requirements the industry has put forward. The ANX Overseer, Bellcore, has direct operations and management responsibilities over the network. Participating Internet Service Providers and Network Exchange Points have been certified and will operate according to the terms of the ANX. A common set of business practices, including ""acceptable use"" policies and common network level security methods are additional conditions of participation in the ANX. Businesses will pursue alternatives most suitable for their immediate business requirements. For some, standard off-the-shelf solutions running over the public Internet are satisfactory. For others, customized solutions--along with explicit rules and operating procedures--may be the answer. As the Internet's performance and reliability improves over time, and as predictable legal frameworks emerge, the growth of business-to-business electronic commerce will accelerate.  23   CHAPTER FOUR: DIGITAL DELIVERY OF GOODS AND SERVICES  Software, CDs, magazine articles, news broadcasts, stocks, airline tickets and insurance policies are all intangible goods whose value does not rely on a physical form. Much of today's intellectual property is produced, packaged, stored somewhere and then physically delivered to its final destination. The technology exists (or soon will exist) to transfer the content of these products in digital form over the Internet.  CONTENT News from around the world is now available on the Internet, usually free of charge. More than 2,700 newspapers have online businesses, of which over 60 percent are U.S.-based.55 All but three of the top 50 magazines in the country (as defined by paid circulation) had a Web presence as of January 1998.56 More than 800 TV stations across the U.S. have Web sites.57 UltimateTV.com lists 151 U.S. cable channels including CNN, fX, HBO, MTV, the Weather Channel and a host of others.58 AudioNet calls itself the leader in Internet broadcasting, with live continuous broadcasts of over 175 radio and television stations, play-by-play of thousands of college and professional sporting events, live music, on-demand music from the CD Jukebox (over 1,600 full-length CDs), live and on-demand shows and Internet-only Webcasts and live and on-demand corporate and special events. The rapid emergence of information services on the Internet is being driven by consumer demand, more effective distribution, and an expected shift in advertising revenues away from traditional media to the Internet.  Consumer Demand Nearly 90 percent of Web users go online to get news and information.59 There, they can find obscure or limited circulation journals online as well as the top sellers. Articles limited to text and perhaps a picture in a print edition may be supplemented in the online version with video or audio clips, maps or in-depth background research. Still somewhat difficult to navigate, the Internet's wide selection of content sites save individuals time when conducting research, and yield much more complete and up-to-date information than offline alternatives. As technology advances and search tools become easier to use, individuals can be expected to increasingly turn to the Internet's content sites to do research, to learn about the day's news, and to be entertained.  24   How quickly individuals change their behavior in favor of the Internet, and away from other media, is difficult to determine. Recent studies indicate that as use of the Internet increases, television viewing declines.60 However, some of today's Web businesses point out that circulation for their existing newspapers and magazines has not dropped, even while their Web audiences increase. They state that some in the online audience are also found among their most loyal print readers, but look to each medium to satisfy different purposes. For instance, Business Week reports that visitors to its Web site read the front page article and then use the site to research the magazine's archives and special report sections, features they do not have in the print version. It may take a number of years before the impact is felt. For instance, McGraw-Hill's financial information services division began to distribute its products electronically over ten years ago. Up until three years ago, print revenues made up 85 percent of the division's sales. Today, digital products account for more than 50 percent of sales. Lower Capital and Distribution Costs The New York Times invested $350 million in its new printing press. Readers can now see frontpage photos in color instead of black and white. Readers accessing the New York Times on the Web not only see color photos from the print version's front page, they get radio clips, color spreads on special feature sections for the Web only, and the chance to interact with other New York Times readers interested in the day's or week's hot topics. Web content businesses require a much lower capital investment than their print counterparts, lowering the barrier to entry in this online industry. With the Internet, the content of a newspaper or a magazine does not have to be printed and delivered to news stands or doorsteps across the city in order to be consumed--steps that add 30 to 40 percent to the cost of the product. Instead, content delivered via the Internet can be entered directly into a computer, stored digitally on a server and appear directly on a reader's computer screen with a few simple commands the reader enters on the Web site. The consumer can then read the information on the screen or print it out. The publisher's distribution costs include paying off the investment in the Web servers and other technology that ensures that when someone enters the site, it responds quickly. Unlike newspaper or magazine content that gets used once, digitally-stored content offers the potential for repeated repackaging and reuse. Once the content has been created and stored, there is little or no extra cost to send it to one reader or 1,000 readers. That increases the efficiency of the newspaper and magazine businesses dramatically. However, simply establishing a presence on the Internet does not guarantee that a business will succeed. Building brand awareness through advertising and marketing is critical to success in a new and rapidly evolving market, particularly on the Internet where consumers have the choice of spending their time and money at thousands of different sites. If the Internet evolves in such a way that a limited number of sites become the ""funnel"" that guides a viewer through its vast content, businesses looking to appeal to mass audiences may have to pay large fees to secure ""shelf space"" on those sites. Or, they may be excluded altogether. In this scenario, advertising 25   and marketing costs may become too expensive for some to bear. If, on the other hand, technology and consumer preference evolves so that consumers access and navigate the Internet using a variety of devices and tools (perhaps personal software ""agents""), then high rents might be avoided. Statistics on Web traffic indicate that the ""funnel"" model is winning out today. Over time, as people begin to access the Web via their TVs, telephones and personal digital assistants, and as the Web becomes easier to navigate, this may change and lower advertising and marketing costs may result.  Shift of revenue sources to the Internet Even with their lower costs of operation, content businesses on the Web do not yet generate adequate revenues. Unlike newspapers and magazines that rely on subscriptions for some of their revenue, most Web businesses currently shy away from charging subscriptions in favor of building an audience and attracting advertising and direct marketing/transactions revenues. Though growing, these revenue sources are still small. At this early stage of development, it is unclear how quickly Internet content businesses will draw readers or viewers away from traditional media sources such as newspapers, magazines and television. As it happens, advertising and subscription revenues flowing to the Internet are likely to increase. Even if the total audience for a newspaper or a TV sitcom does not decline, advertisers may shift spending to the Internet if they feel that it provides a more effective means to reach their audiences. Current trends in classified and local advertising spending indicate a shift already taking place. Newspapers have been watching their share of classified advertising dollars shrink as real estate agents, car dealers and owners, and businesses looking to hire employees increase their advertising in niche publications, direct mail and online services. A 1996 Newspaper Association of America study points out that newspaper publishers could lose as much as 50 percent of their classified ad dollars in the next five years if current trends continue. If that happens, the average newspaper's operating margin, now 14 percent, would drop to 3 percent.61 To maintain revenues from classifieds and to attract local advertising dollars, newspapers have been quick to establish Web sites featuring classified ads and city guides. Other industries are also seeking a share of classified and local advertising revenues. Software companies, telephone companies, Internet service providers, television networks and newspapers are gearing up to compete for a share of this potentially large market. A New York-based research firm, Find/SVP, reported that more than 60 corporations ranging from Warner Brothers and PacTel to NBC and U.S. West have launched, or are in the process of organizing, Web sites with a strong emphasis on local content.62  26   Software companies and search engines feature city guides listing movies and restaurants, arts and music, current events, places to go, local sports, weather and news. Some broadcast and cable networks combine coverage of national news and entertainment with local news from affiliates and searchable databases of online classified ads. Directory listings and mapping services partner with newspapers, software companies and others to offer their own city guides. Telephone companies have their own directory listings and mapping services and are partnering with others for real estate listings, restaurant guides, and other local information and services. Analysts project significant growth in revenues available for online content businesses. Forrester Research predicts that revenues from advertising, subscriptions and transactions fees will grow to $8.5 billion within five years,63 or almost 5 percent of the $175 billion advertisers spent in newspapers, TV, radio, direct mail, billboards, and other traditional media in 1996.64  TRAVEL Vacationers and business travelers can now find information on the Internet about cities they plan to visit, from driving directions and recommended itineraries to weather patterns and business telephone numbers and addresses. Many hotels have detailed property descriptions, along with photos of the property's grounds, public rooms and bedrooms. Rental cars can be reserved online. Top travel magazines offer online suggestions for the best week-end getaways. The largest initial online travel business is the sale of airline tickets. Web-based travel services offer the reservations engines that airline customer service representatives and travel agents use directly to leisure and business travelers. Customers enter point-to-point destinations, desired travel times and dates, preferred airlines, and other preferences into the reservation system. The system processes the information and delivers a choice of options, along with a secure transactions environment for customers who wish to purchase the ticket online. In 1996, Web users booked $276 million worth of travel this way. For 1997, online travel sales are estimated to have reached $816 million. By the year 2000, online travel sales could reach $5 billion,65 or close to 7 percent of U.S. airlines' revenues for passenger air travel.66 According to a survey released in November 1997 by the Travel Industry Association of America, 13.8 million Americans used the Internet to plan their trips and 6.3 million made reservations on the Internet. And, consumer acceptance is growing. In 1996, 10 percent of Internet users used the Internet to make travel plans and purchases. When polled in 1997, nearly 70 percent of Internet users said they planned to use the Internet for travel in the upcoming year. Acceptance is high among the general population, as well. Thirty-eight percent of all adults said they would consider using the Internet for their travel in 1998. Lower sales and marketing costs, and increased consumer choice and convenience are driving the Internet's increased use in travel planning and reservations.  27   Lower sales and marketing costs It is cheaper for an airline to process a ticket sale online than to use a travel agent or a reservations center. Not only are transaction fees reduced, but savings are also realized when cheaper electronic tickets can be substituted for more expensive paper tickets. Through the use of the Internet and other information technology, airlines expect to be able to significantly cut distribution costs. At $12 billion, distribution--travel agent commissions, marketing and advertising expenses, labor and other expenses for airline central reservations services--is the airline industry's second largest operating expense.67 Figure 7. Cost to Process Airline Tickets $8.00: Travel agent books, using computer reservation system $6.00: Travel agent books direct with airline $1.00: Customer books ""electronic ticket"" direct with airline Source: Air Transport Association of America, 11/20/97  How a ticket is sold, through an agent or by the airline directly, and whether the ticket is paper or electronic, can mean the difference between paying $8.00 or $1.00 to process a ticket (Figure 7).68  Airlines are pursuing various strategies to drive their distribution costs down: lowering travel agent commissions, selling through the Internet and promoting electronic ticketing. Southwest Airlines was the first major U.S. airline to let passengers buy tickets directly on their Internet site in 1996, bypassing the agent and the commission. New Web travel services quickly emerged: online travel sites sponsored by airlines themselves, ""virtual"" travel agents like Microsoft's Expedia.com and The SABRE Group's Travelocity.com, and travel agents' own sites. Whether customers purchase tickets on an airline's site or through online travel agents, the airlines save money since their own travel reservations centers do not have to be involved in the purchase. In addition, the commissions they pay to online agents are about half what they pay to traditional agents.69 While the airlines' ability to move customers away from paper tickets to lower-cost electronic tickets does not depend on the Internet, it is proving to be a useful vehicle for accelerating the shift. Some airlines encourage their Internet customers to use electronic tickets by offering frequent flyer miles for travel booked online with an electronic ticket. Because Internet customers reserve their tickets, select seats and give credit card information online, getting an electronic ticket rather than a paper one seems natural. Airlines also use the Web to generate additional revenues. No matter how precise an airline's forecasting, seats still go unsold on some flights. Auctioning airline seats to the highest bidder and offering special ""cyberfares"" for leisure travel are two techniques made possible by the Internet. 28   Every Monday or Tuesday, American Airlines looks at its yield management results and picks out low-performing markets. Midweek, more than one million ""NetSAAver"" subscribers receive an e-mail from American Airlines listing special discounted fares for travel in selected markets during the upcoming weekend. The NetSAAver program has generated tens of millions of incremental dollars for the airline since its launch in March 1996.  RETAIL BANKING Internet banking is still in its infancy. Although most of the top 100 banks in the U.S. have a Web site, the Online Banking Report classifies 24 of them as ""True Internet Banks""--banks that let their customers review balances, transfer funds and pay bills on their Web sites. Smaller banks also have Web presences. In Online Banking's list of 133 ""True Internet Banks,"" 109 do not make the list of the top 100 U.S. banks ranked by assets.70 Before the decade is out, customers are likely to be able to do most of their banking transactions on the Web. According to a 1996 Booz-Allen & Hamilton survey of North American financial institutions with Web sites, 80 percent of respondents planned to allow their customers to conduct most traditional banking transactions over the Internet within three years.71 Online retail banking is being driven by lower operating costs, the ability to offer new services, and the ability to do one-to-one marketing.  Lower operating costs Online banking services are less expensive to offer to customers than other forms of banking. Checking an account balance or transferring funds from a checking account to a savings account can be done in person at a branch bank, over the telephone, with an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM), at home using a PC, or, in some cases, on a bank's Web site. A branch bank can serve as many customers as it has staff to handle. Once the investment is made to create a fully functioning Internet site (for a  Figure 8. Internet Banking is Cheaper for Banks  1.2 1.07  1 Cost per Transaction ($) 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.27  0.52  0.2 0 0.01 0.015  Internet  PC Banking  ATM  Telephone  Branch  Source: Booz-Allen & Hamilton  29   large bank, the initial investment could be millions of dollars; a more limited solution for a small bank might cost tens of thousands of dollars), the bank's Web site can handle one customer inquiry or tens of thousands a day. Booz-Allen & Hamilton estimates that it costs about a penny to conduct a banking transaction using the Internet and more than one dollar if handled by a teller at a branch bank (Figure 8).72 New Services Today's online banking allows customers to check account balances, transfer funds, and update customer information--transactions that can already be performed through traditional banking channels. For some customers, the convenience of banking from home or the office is preferable to calling the bank's automated phone service or going to a branch bank. Others do not find the services offered online today reason enough to change their banking habits. In the future, analysts expect that Internet banking will be enhanced with new services that make online banking easier and more convenient than banking by ATM, by phone, or visiting the branch bank. Paying bills electronically is one such example. Checks are the preferred method of bill payment in the United States.73 For a business, preparing and sending paper bills can be costly. For a consumer, paying bills by check can take a great deal of time. Billers print out and mail the bills to a consumer's home. The consumer writes a check, records the check number and amount paid, balances the checkbook, finds a stamp and mails the check back to the biller. The biller receives the check, updates his accounts and sends the check to the bank to credit to his account. Handling paper bills and checks can cost a biller between $1.65 and $2.70 each time he sends out a bill.74 It costs the customer time and the price of a stamp to pay each bill. Today's Internet-based bill payment services take some of the paperwork out of the process. Rather than writing a paper check and mailing it to the vendor, a customer authorizes his bank to pay bills on his behalf. This saves the customer some time, and may save the vendor some money, if all steps are completed electronically. However, vendors still incur the costs of mailing the bill to the customer. And, smaller vendors without an electronic connection still have a series of manual and paper-based steps to complete. Some banks believe that future Web-based bill payment services can make the entire process paperless. The vendor will send an electronic image of the bill to the customer's bank. The customer will electronically authorize the bank to pay the bill, the bank will debit the customer's account, and the vendor will receive payment electronically. The vendor's printing and mailing costs are eliminated, and processing costs are greatly reduced. The customer enjoys the convenience of paying bills without having to keep stamps and envelopes on hand. With services that automatically update account balances, the customer also saves time he formerly spent balancing his checkbook.  30   One-to-one Marketing Today, most banks are still equipping their Web sites with basic transactions processing and do little with tailored or one-to-one marketing. However, some now realize that through the Internet, a bank can get to know a customer's banking priorities and preferences even better than it could when banking was done in small neighborhood branches. Bank of America's ""Build Your Own Bank"" provides an example of how one-to-one marketing could work. Internet customers using this service provide the bank with basic information about their place of residence, occupation, age, income and gender, whether they own or rent a home, and what types of accounts they have with the bank. They then indicate their financial interests and priorities--whether saving and investing, home buying/improvement, building a business, retirement, economic and financial markets, electronic commerce, or simply better financial organization and budgeting. Based on these inputs, the bank responds with Money Tips and news items geared to the customer's interests, and special offers for the services the customer has prioritized. These and similar mechanisms give banks the opportunity to cross-sell products and services. Ideally, the customer benefits from these tailored offerings, as well. At a minimum, he should benefit from greater convenience. Because his account profile automatically gets called up when the customer logs into a personalized site, he wastes no time entering account information. Having up-to-date information about balances in each account gives the customer a snapshot of his holdings with the bank without having to do the math himself. The personalized tips and special offers may help the customer to make important financial decisions.  The Future Over the next few years, a growing number of American households are expected to do their banking online--whether through a dial-up connection to their bank or through the Internet. Roughly 4.5 million households were banking online in 1997. By the year 2000, as many as 16 million households are expected to bank online.75  INSURANCE Insurance carriers' Web sites typically provide customers with basic corporate and policy information, but refer customers to offline agents or customer service phone representatives in order to make a purchase. A more limited number of carriers' sites, and other sites, including banks, securities brokerages, real estate companies and automobile marketplaces, allow Internet customers to purchase term life, automobile and homeowners' insurance online.  31   Table 4. Internet Sales of Personal Insurance Projected to Grow 1997 $21 M $17 M $1.1 M $39.1 M 2001 $850 $108 $152 $1.1 By 2001, analysts project that more than $1 billion in premiums will be generated via the Internet (Table 4).76 The rapid increase in sales will be driven by cost savings, increased competition and growing consumer acceptance.  Auto Term life Homeowner Total  M M M B  Source: Forrester Research  Cost savings Distribution costs for life and property and casualty policies can be as high as 33 percent or more of the product's price.77 Selling policies and providing customer service over the Internet is much less expensive than via an agent or a telephone representative--as much as 58-71 percent lower over the lifetime of a customer.78 In a direct online sale by the carrier, the agent commission is avoided. If the sale is completed by an online agent such as Quicken InsureMarket, it can be more than cut in half. Even if a traditional agent completes the transaction started on the Internet, the transaction is less expensive. The Internet prequalifies the customer for the agent, saving sales time and expense. The Internet can also be used for electronic communication between agents and carriers, reducing time spent on routine tasks such as applications processing, updating customer account information, and reporting on the status of claims. In addition to saving money, the Internet can generate new sales opportunities. Carriers that traditionally sell through agents may pick up new customers on the Internet that agents cannot effectively reach. Because of the time needed to acquire a new customer, agents tend to focus on clients they believe will buy larger policies. One insurer, Lincoln Benefit Life, reports differences in the face value of the policies it sells via the Internet and through independent agents. The majority of policies sold by an agent have face values of $500,000 or greater. Online, Lincoln reaches customers who wish to purchase policies with face values of $500,000 and under.  Increased competition Banks and securities brokerages have begun to sell insurance in their aim to be the one-stop shop for consumers' financial services needs. Whether through alliances with insurers or in direct competition with them, these new entrants will affect how insurers go to market. At the moment, both banks and securities brokerages are embracing the Internet more rapidly than insurers.  32   Growing consumer demand Surveys indicate that people would like to be able to get quotes, pay premiums and update their policies online--functions that are not yet provided on most insurance carriers' sites today. Insurance executives believe that within five years, their customers will prefer to receive auto and term life policies online to purchasing from an agent. They will get product information and quotes, pay premiums, compare prices, access their access and update their policy information, and get advice from financial service purchase and use the Web to claims status, experts.79  THE FUTURE Most industry watchers predict that the market for the digital delivery of products and services will evolve quickly. The rate varies considerably by industry, however. Selling travel online appears to have the fewest constraints, perhaps because computer reservations systems have been in place for years. Analysts predict rapid growth in travel services, from less than $1 billion in 1997 to close to $8 billion within three to five years.80 Similarly, the financial services area is poised for quick growth. Nearly 5 million people actively trade stocks online and pay $8 - $30 per trade (traditional brokerages charge an average of $80 per trade).81 Investment bank Piper Jaffrey estimates that $614 million in broker commissions were generated online in 1997. This represents more than 4 percent of total retail brokerage commissions and 29 percent of the $2.1 billion in commissions attributable to the discount brokerage sector.82 Analysts predict that 10-16 million households will bank online by 2000, more than double the number in 1997.83 Internet-generated premiums for insurance are expected to grow from $39 million in 1997 to $1.1 billion by 2001.84 Other digital products and services have significant growth potential, but their long-term success is tied to solutions for protecting copyrights and to improvements in the Internet infrastructure. Intellectual property holders--software developers, recording artists and record companies, movie studios, authors and publishers--worry that digital copies sold or transmitted over the Internet may be prone to copyright infringement and piracy. The Internet is a natural, low-cost distribution channel for these digital products, but the uncertainty of whether their products can be protected impedes growth. Companies are working with technological solutions such as ""watermarks"" and ""digital object identifiers"" so that they can keep track of their products online. In December 1996, governments negotiated treaties at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to address the question of how copyright should be recognized and protected in global Internet commerce. The U.S. government is working to have these treaties ratified in the U.S. and around the world.  33   For the multimedia industry, the question of bandwidth is crucial. Until Web users can download a video in a matter or seconds, Web sites will not create many video products to sell online and Web users will prefer to read text, watch television or use their VCR. Increased bandwidth will also benefit education and health care services. Educational services will be able to use more video programming to supplement other online resources. The Web can also be a very useful tool in medical education and for the delivery of health care diagnostic services. Today's Web users can access some information from their health plans and physicians about medical conditions, symptoms and suggested treatments. Increasingly, they will be able to schedule appointments, pay bills, and check the status of their claims online. As new equipment is developed for remote diagnosis, doctors will be able to diagnose some medical conditions and recommend treatments to patients via the Internet (state laws and regulations regarding telemedicine and licensure may limit how widely remote diagnosis is used). However, because some medical diagnostics require very high-quality images (poor resolution could give the impression of a tumor or a fracture where none exists, for instance), improvements in bandwidth, image quality and reliability will need to occur before telemedicine and remote medical diagnostics emerge as viable industries on the Internet.  34   CHAPTER FIVE: RETAIL SALE OF TANGIBLE GOODS  In addition to goods and services that can be delivered electronically, the Internet is also used to sell physical goods. Increasing demands on leisure time and the improvement of overnight and second-day delivery services that spurred the growth of catalog shopping in the 1980s and 1990s are now leading people to shop over the Internet. A fall/winter 1997 CommerceNet/Nielsen study found that 10 million Web users in the U.S. and Canada (about 16 percent of all Internet users in North America) have actually purchased something on the Web, up from 7.4 million six months earlier. A much larger number use the Web to shop, but they still close the transaction over the telephone or at a store.85 Internet consumers report that they shop on the Web because of convenience, ease of research and good prices.86 Where most Internet shoppers bought computer software and hardware a year ago, today's shoppers buy more mainstream items. America Online (AOL), the largest Internet Service Provider with 11 million customers, reported a shift in online buying patterns during the 1997 holiday season. Apparel climbed to the top spot, and books, to third place this year. Also popular were food, flowers, music and toys.87 Internet retailers pursue a variety of strategies to attract customers. Just as one would find in traditional retailing, specialty retailers, large discounters and malls/marketplaces have their places online. Internet consumers may also visit online auction houses or use a ""personal agent"" to help with their shopping. Most Internet stores try to make online shopping as familiar and as easy as possible. Physical products arranged on store shelves are replaced with electronic catalogs that include photographs, detailed product descriptions, pricing and size information. Third-party reviews may be available to assist the buyer in choosing between different brands or models. When ready to make a purchase, the customer clicks on the product and puts it into a virtual ""shopping cart,"" and may continue shopping or proceed directly to check out. First-time customers enter basic name and address information, along with a credit card, hit the enter key on the computer, and the transaction is completed. Recognizing that customers may want to speak with a company representative directly in some instances, many Internet retail sites offer toll-free customer service numbers. Just as traditional bookstores feature tables of bestsellers and gift books, and organize racks of books by subject area, Internet bookstores also provide guides through their vast virtual selection. For those who know the title or the author of the book, a keyword search scans the entire inventory in a matter of moments, retrieves the title, along with a brief description and review of the book, and a button to add it to the customer's shopping cart. Visitors may also browse for a 35   book according to topic. The topic can be as broadly defined as ""history"" or as narrowly defined as ""Civil War."" At the same time they borrow from concepts familiar to traditional retail, Internet merchants do not think that merely duplicating what can be found offline is enough to convince customers to shop online. Early pioneers of Internet retail talk about attracting customers with additional value, selection and entertainment. The Cendant Corporation, a $5.3 billion consumer goods and services company, sells over one million products and services on its Web site, from cars to electronics and cameras, books, appliances, luggage, perfume, flowers and gifts, computer hardware and software, video games and a variety of other goods and services. For an annual membership fee of $69, Cendant claims that its netMarket Web site satisfies 20 percent of the average family's shopping needs. Because the company's business model relies almost entirely on membership fees, Cendant reports that it sells products to retail customers at, or near, wholesale prices. In 1997, Cendant facilitated the sale of more than $1.2 billion worth of products and services over the Internet. Before the decade comes to a close, the company plans to offer a product selection which will cover 95 percent of the products a typical household would buy. Internet Shopping Network's First Auction site aims to attract Internet users looking for adventure, entertainment, and seeking a bargain. People from all over the country bid against each other in real-time to ""win"" products. First Auction starts many of its bids at $1.00, well below a product's cost. Bidders quickly bid up the price, competing with each other to take possession of golf clubs, CD players, television sets, jewelry and a range of other items. Launched in July 1997, First Auction's membership roster approached 100,000 people by the end of 1997, and 30,00 people visited the site each day. An Internet shopper need not go to a ""store"" in order to buy something. In fact, the concept of retail is blurring. Some media sites, online service providers and search engines prominently feature retailers and provide direct links to their sites. Some give customers the ability to buy goods directly from their own sites. Time Warner, the media and entertainment company, has a marketplace on its Web site featuring retailers selling books, music, travel, computers and electronics, vitamins and more. Visitors using Yahoo!'s search engine can buy products from The Visa Shopping Guide by Yahoo!. A shopper who wants to buy a pair of ladies' shoes, but does not want to go from Web store to Web store to shop, can use the ""one search"" option and a software agent scans the offerings of participating retailers for selection and price information in one trip. An interested buyer can click on the ""buy"" button and be transported to the Web page featuring a picture and a more detailed description of the shoes at the retailer's site to finish the transaction. Even buying a car, more of an investment than a typical retail purchase, is possible to do through a number of auto marketplaces, online classified sites, and manufacturers' own sites. JD Power & Associates, a marketing information firm specializing in the automotive industry, estimates that roughly 16 percent of all new car and truck buyers used the Internet as part of their shopping 36   process in 1997, up from 10 percent in 1996. By 2000, they project that the Internet will be used in at least 21 percent of all new car and truck purchases.88 As in other areas, the growth of online retailing is being driven by cost savings, the ability to customize marketing, and increased consumer convenience. Virtual stores report lower operating costs than their physical counterparts. Costs of supporting a store infrastructure--rent and depreciation, labor, utilities and other expenses - - are almost entirely avoided online. 1-800-FLOWERS sells flowers through its own flower shops, affiliated flower shops in major cities across the country, by telephone sales and online. Although its online business generates only 10 percent of its total revenues, its profit contribution to the overall business is nearly that of its store-based business which generates 20 percent of total revenues.89 Direct marketing in traditional retail is already quite sophisticated: retailers can access and manipulate extensive databases made up of warranty information for cars, appliances and consumer electronics. Retailers can use this information to attract new customers by sending mailings to consumers living in certain zip codes that fit given demographic or other specialized profiles. Databases of existing customers may be even more detailed, allowing retailers to send more targeted offers. In either case, these direct mailings often take time and significant expense to compile, mail and then review their effectiveness. Though not really in practice yet, the Internet offers the opportunity to take direct marketing to the next level: to market directly to narrow bands of customers--even to individuals--and to do so profitably. When a customer visits a site, for example, the site may say ""hello"" and state the visitor's name. It knows who is there because of a technology that records the Internet address of the visitor and matches it to a name if the visitor has already registered or purchased something at the site. Web businesses also keep track of what an individual customer purchases. Increasingly, Web businesses will send a message to the buyer of a 28.8 kbps modem that the company now offers the latest 56 kbps modem; the person who buys a certain style and size of pants and sweaters will receive notices of new merchandise in that style or size, along with suggestions for accessories to match; the adventure traveler whose last trip was to Nepal at the height of trekking season may receive information about the newest hiking boots and multi-day packs to hit the market or an invitation to join a team traveling to Patagonia. Right now, many consumers are wary of this type of marketing, fearing a loss of personal privacy. If Web users become convinced that they can protect their privacy online at the same time they make these offers, targeted marketing will likely become commonplace. Amazon.com has taken some first steps in this direction. It greets site visitors by name, informs customers by e-mail when a particular book has arrived or sends them reviews of ""best new books"" in areas where the customer has indicated an interest. An ""instant recommendations"" feature proposes books to customers based on purchases they have made at Amazon. Customers can also get an accounting of their purchases at Amazon or see the status of their orders. 37   THE FUTURE Analysts believe that Internet retailing (where sales are actually completed on the Internet) will grow quickly, but they vary widely on just how quickly. On the conservative end, it is expected to reach $7 billion by the year 2000.90 If mail order sales are used to determine the potential for Web retail sales, as some suggest, the figure could reach $115 billion in five to eight years.91 If online shopping provides customers with a larger assortment, better prices, and greater choice than mail order companies, the figure may even exceed that projection. To make the most of the potential of the Internet, retailers will have to overcome a number of challenges. Among others, they will need to increase consumer confidence in relying on computer images and information to determine the quality and fit of a product, and simplify the process of returning defective or unwanted merchandise. They will also need to address the question of credit card security and consumer privacy.  Making Virtual Purchases More ""Real"" How can virtual images on the Internet replicate the sensation of picking up a product, feeling the material and its texture or sturdiness, trying it on (in the case of clothing) or sitting down on it (in the case of a sofa) before making the decision to buy? As described earlier, Internet retailers offer very detailed product descriptions online. Many provide toll-free numbers for customers who prefer to speak with a sales representative before making a purchase. As video and voice become more widely used, some Internet sites can be expected to give customers the choice to click on a button and speak directly with a customer service or sales representative via the Internet. As bandwidth increases, three-dimensional images that show the product from a variety of angles will supplement or replace the flat photos on most sites today. Customers visiting Internet furniture stores will be able to furnish their own homes and apartments by ""dragging and dropping"" furniture and accessory icons into rooms the customer has made to resemble those in his home. This feature will enable customers to gauge how well different pieces of furniture fit into a room of a given size, and which furniture styles or colors work best together. How well will Internet retailers satisfy demands, particularly in the U.S., for immediate gratification, no-fuss returns, and a strong customer service policy? Customers are generally interested in speed of delivery and ease of return. The emergence of extensive overnight shipping in many parts of the world already allows retailers--including those on the Internet--to provide quick, reliable service. As Web retailing increases, overnight delivery and ""drop shipping"" services from manufacturers to the customer's home are likely to grow as well. Customers who worry that they will have to make an extra trip to the post office or parcel delivery company if a product they order via the Internet is not what they had in mind may be surprised to learn that some companies will actually send packaging overnight, free of charge, 38   to a customer's home, along with instructions to return the product, free of charge, to the company.  Making transactions secure Most Internet purchases are currently made by entering credit card and delivery information on a computerized form and transmitting it electronically to the retailer. Even though consumers are accustomed to giving credit card information over the telephone, many are reluctant to give it online for fear that it will be stolen or misused. This reluctance is often cited as the largest barrier to the growth of retail sales on the Internet. Web retailers believe that concerns about credit card security will lessen, particularly as more people shop online, have trouble-free experiences, and tell their friends and relatives about them. In fact, some already detect greater comfort among their consumers this year as compared to one year ago. (1-800-FLOWERS recently reported that fewer than one-third of its customers worry about credit card security, compared to almost 75 percent in 1996.92) Word of mouth, combined with technology and standards for safeguarding sensitive information, should help to alleviate these concerns. Smart cards and digital cash will also be used for electronic commerce. Instead of reentering name, address and credit card information each time a purchase is made at a different Web site, information already stored on the smart card will be transmitted to the merchant electronically, saving steps for the consumer and reducing fraud by automatically validating the consumer's identity. For those consumers who wish to purchase goods or services anonymously, digital cash and stored value cards (cards worth a set amount of money) will also be available at banks and other companies for use over the network.  Ensuring Privacy of Personal Information Consumers worry about protecting the privacy of their personal information, as well. A majority of respondents to a recent Business Week/Harris poll mentioned privacy as the main reason they do not use the Internet. More than three-quarters of current users say they would use the Web more if privacy were guaranteed.93 Some sites request that new visitors volunteer personal information upon entering the site. In exchange for that information, they may offer ""membership"" services such as birthday reminder emails, new product announcements or newsletters. A purchase may trigger the gathering and creation of a customer profile, as Internet retailers need basic personal information in order to deliver a physical good to a customer. Or, an Internet user may leave an electronic ""footprint"" of visits to different Web sites and purchases he has made and not even be aware of doing so.  39   Often today, consumers are not given the opportunity to block the gathering of information or, when they freely give it, to indicate how they would like that information to be used (for instance, whether the company should restrict its use to internal purposes, whether it can be disseminated to external companies if specific conditions are met, or whether it can be widely disseminated). Some realize that their information has been sold without their knowledge or consent when they receive unwanted e-mail. Some may see the positive side to data collection and direct marketing the next time they go to buy a book and are presented with suggestions of new releases in keeping with their interests and past purchases. Nevertheless, they want some control over when and how their data are collected and used. In order to empower consumers to have control of their own personal information, the U.S. government is encouraging the private sector to establish codes of conduct and self-regulation. To be meaningful, the government believes that self-regulation must do more than articulate broad policies or guidelines. Effective self-regulation involves substantive rules, as well as the means to ensure that consumers know the rules, that companies comply with them, and that consumers have appropriate recourse when there is noncompliance. Consumers need to know the identity of the collector of their personal information, the intended uses of the information, and the means by which they may limit its disclosure. They should be given the opportunity to exercise choice with respect to whether and how their personal information is used. Companies creating, maintaining, using or disseminating records of identifiable personal information must take reasonable measures to assure its reliability for its intended use and must take reasonable precautions to protect it from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. In addition, consumers should have the opportunity for reasonable, appropriate access to information about them that a company holds, and be able to correct or amend that information when necessary.  Consumer retail on the Internet is already showing signs of rapid growth. As retailers address the challenges outlined above and as consumers become more familiar and comfortable with buying goods online, the Internet could emerge as an important retail channel.  40   CHAPTER SIX: CONSUMERS IN THE DIGITAL AGE  Businesses invest in information technology and electronic commerce to increase productivity, cut costs and enhance customer service. Consumers shop on the Internet because they find their choices dramatically increased. They have access to much more information when making purchasing decisions. Busy consumers can save time and find shopping more convenient as merchants serve their needs individually. Better information and greater selection, combined with lower operating costs for many Internet business may, in turn, drive reductions in prices or improvements in quality.  CHOICE The sheer number of stores that can be ""visited"" online far exceeds even the most densely populated retail areas in the country. No longer do customers find their shopping limited to the stores within a reasonable driving or walking distance or to the catalogues they receive in the mail. Online, customers can shop at stores in other states, in other countries, and at stores that do not exist in traditional formats. News and newspapers provide a vivid example. Residents of large cities already benefit by being able to buy a number of different national and regional newspapers from coin-operated machines and specialty news outlets. Outside large cities, however, the selection is much more limited. Online, readers can access news from thousands of newspapers around the world. An online reader interested in news about the 1998 winter Olympics in Nagano can access coverage in Japan's Asahi Shimbun as well as turning to coverage in the American media. The vast selection is not limited to products and services that can be delivered digitally. Web sites selling consumer electronics, gardening supplies, office supplies and other hard goods also offer larger selections than do their counterparts in traditional retail. The largest chain bookstores carry about 150,000 different books. On the Web, readers can choose from 2.5 million titles under one roof, covering both in-print and out-of-print books. In addition to general purpose bookstores, specialty stores carry books on antiques, books written in foreign languages, rare editions, and other books that would require extensive phone calls and physical trips to obtain. On the Web, readers can enter the keywords identifying the types of books they want, choose some promising sites, search their inventories, and often have the book delivered within a few days or a week.  41   CONVENIENCE Consumers cite convenience as the number one reason for making a purchase online. Shopping on the Internet can save time. A consumer does not have to travel to a store site or adjust his schedule around the store's hours. No longer does a consumer have to wait on hold for a customer service representative to answer the phone. Recognizing that customers may want products delivered as soon as possible, many sites offer next day or second-day delivery. Online support tools--order status, product availability and pricing, technical support and troubleshooting tips--are generally supplemented with toll-free numbers that customers may call for further information. The example of Garden Escape, an Internet-based gardening company, shows how combining products and services in a virtual ""store"" can save consumers a great deal of time and effort. The founders of Garden Escape wanted to create a one-stop shop for gardening needs. They began by taking an inventory of all the resources a gardener uses today: nurseries and seed catalogs for plants and tools, other retailers for specialty outdoor products; books and magazines for tips on the plants and flowers that flourish or perish in certain soil and climate conditions; gardening clubs where hobbyist gardeners share suggestions with other enthusiasts; and the extensive array of catalogs, books and CD-ROMs that help gardeners in designing a garden. By offering a virtual, rather than real, inventory, Garden Escape offers a selection of products that even the largest nursery could not possibly stock--a selection of 10,000 seeds, perennials, roses, bulbs, greenhouses, tools and other gardening products from around the world. Serious gardeners can use online software tools to design their ideal garden. For suggestions and tips, there's an online magazine, a chat room and new daily tips from the magazine's editors. A consumer with a question about a horticultural term can check out the glossary, or call Garden Escape's toll-free number.  BETTER AND MORE COMPLETE INFORMATION Web consumers are often better informed than their offline counterparts. Two examples--shopping for a car and shopping for an insurance policy--illustrate the differences between purchasing via the Internet and purchasing through traditional means. Shopping for a car can be a very complex process. model of car, outfitting it with different accessories options (whether to lease or buy and how to obtain insurance policy, and negotiating a fair price. Prior could take a lot of time, and many consumers went changes the dynamic. It involves choosing a particular make and and performance options, choosing financing the best rates), purchasing or updating an auto to the Internet, gathering that information to dealer showrooms ill-prepared. The Web  Web shoppers can view pictures of different car models and read extensive information on the car's features and performance. Financing and insurance options are also available online. 42   At Auto-by-Tel, a leading Web-based auto marketplace, shoppers can access model and pricing information, including dealer invoice pricing and manufacturer rebate information on all new and used cars from 2,700 accredited dealers from across the country. Along with a picture of the car and brief descriptions, the customer can access new-car and used-car pricing from third party sources like AutoSite, Edmund's, CarCenter and the Kelley Blue Book. After deciding which car to buy, the customer enters the zip code where he or she lives and the make and model of the car desired. A screen pops up requesting that the customer indicate what color exterior and interior he wants, the type of transmission, the number of cylinders, and when they prefer a 2-door or 4-door model. Then the customer completes a new car purchase request, selecting the manufacturer options to include on the car (radio, power windows, anti-lock brakes, sunroof, etc.) After making these selections and providing contact information, the customer's request is transmitted to the Auto-by-Tel dealer closest to the customer's home. Within 24 hours, the dealer contacts the customer with a firm price. Internet businesses selling life insurance products arm consumers with software tools that help them determine what types of insurance they might need, as well as information to enable them make educated choices between one insurer's policy and another's. Quicken InsureMarket, an Internet-based insurance marketplace, provides one illustration. Visitors maneuver through the InsureMarket site, accessing only the information they want; for example, an explanation of a term they do not understand, information about the carrier's rating, or how much and which type of insurance is suitable for them, given their family's financial profile. A consumer can comparison shop for term life policies by clicking on a button and answering some basic questions about residence, age, health, income, family situation, and the amount of insurance desired. In a matter of moments, the customer receives personalized quotes from up to seven carriers and up to four agent contact options. The system randomly generates the order of the insurance carriers providing quotes and referrals the visitor sees so as not to give an advantage to any single carrier. At a glance, the customer can compare the policies and the prices of several different carriers. Another few clicks of the mouse, and the customer has more information about each carrier and policy to determine whether a price difference between apparently similar policies is really justified. LOWER PRICES Commerce, and therefore competition, on the Internet is still undeveloped. A good deal of Internet retail is being driven by convenience, the search for a broader selection, or the opportunity to find items not readily available in ordinary retail outlets. Despite its infancy, some Internet retailers offer discounts from traditional channels. For instance, online booksellers discount some books by 40 percent over typical bookstore prices.94 (Depending on the cost of delivery, the total cost of an item may be higher on the Internet than at a store.) Consumers buying and selling stocks through the Internet commonly pay $8- $30 per trade, while traditional brokerages charge approximately $80 per trade on average.95 Internet users can access most online news and information free of charge. 43   This pattern of lower prices is not universal. Some retailers have determined that their current Internet customers buy products from them primarily because of convenience, selection or quality. In the short term, they do not feel that lowering prices would lead to additional sales. Some traditional store-based retailers set their prices for products they sell through the Internet at the level found in their stores in order not to adversely impact their store-based business. If retailing continues to grow on the Internet, competition and the favorable economics of the Internet are likely to translate into lower prices for the average consumer.  CUSTOMIZATION The Internet offers the potential for increased customization. Some Web businesses, particularly media businesses, already customize the product to an audience of one. Readers can select only the news they want to read, and it gets ""delivered"" to their personalized Web page on the site, to an e-mail box, or as a service that the computer defaults to when at rest. Music and computers are other products where the combination of innovation and economics is encouraging increased customization. Customers at online music stores have the choice of purchasing CDs available at record stores. Or, if they desire, they can create their own CDs from a growing number of digital recordings. Buying a laptop computer is no longer limited to what a store or a manufacturer has in stock. Instead, consumers can choose from a variety of base models, and purchase the standard configuration or customize the machine according to price and performance requirements. (For instance, the customer can decide whether to pay extra for a speedy 266MHz processor or save some money with a somewhat slower 166MHz processor. Similarly, the base model may have 48 MB of memory (RAM), but additional memory is available for those who need it. Different modems, network adaptors, extra batteries and software packages can be installed by the factory at the customer's request. Even the service package can be tailored to the customer's needs. Traditional retail and mail order outlets, in addition to Web businesses, offer customers the opportunity to customize their computers; the Internet and private networks speed the flow of information and thereby improve the economics of customization. Web-based clothing stores may soon incorporate technology that allows customers to ""try on"" clothing. Deciding between a Large or Extra-Large sweater may be as simple using the computer mouse to ""drag"" the virtual sweater over a 3-D image of oneself to see whether it is too snug or a perfect fit. For retailers and manufacturers who continue to produce standard sizes for their customers, this technology will simulate the physical act of trying on clothing in a store's dressing room. Other businesses may decide to build a business around tailored clothing, using the 3-D image to customize the size and fit of the sweater to that individual customer. The Internet and other new technologies may encourage businesses to explore the feasibility of mass customization; whether and how extensively retailers and manufacturers start to customize clothing, furniture, and other products based on individual customer specifications will ultimately depend on market demand. 44   THE FUTURE Today's Web consumers benefit from a selection of products and services unparalleled in traditional channels. Without leaving home or an office, consumers can access thousands of Web sites to become informed about breaking news and events, research products, and purchase everything from groceries to books to insurance policies. Whether they complete the transaction online or make the purchase at a store after using the Web to help narrow the search for a particular product, the Web arms the consumer with much more knowledge about choices and prices available to them. Despite these advantages, many consumers today still remain wary of the Internet. They are concerned about protecting their privacy and the security of their credit card information. Many do not have computers, or find them too difficult to use. Or, they prefer the experience of shopping and selecting products they can see, feel, or try on in person. For these reasons, shopping in stores will likely be the main way that consumers purchase goods for many years to come. However, the barriers to Internet shopping are likely to be lower for younger consumers. Children today are growing up with the Internet. Over the next decade, as today's children become adults, shopping on the Internet will be easy and natural to them. The growth in the numbers of individuals using the Internet provides strong evidence that consumers perceive its benefits. As more individuals come online, as the Internet becomes easier to access, as Internet commerce increases, and as today's children become adults, the combined effect will be to further enhance the already-present benefits the Internet has to offer.  45   CHAPTER SEVEN: WORKERS IN THE DIGITAL AGE  The rapid growth of the computing and telecommunications industries has already created a large and growing demand for programmers, systems analysts, computer scientists and engineers. If electronic commerce begins to substitute for more conventional sales and services, it will shift employment from traditional occupations to those requiring IT skills and, in many instances, other higher-level cognitive reasoning abilities. Electronic commerce is very much part of a broader national trend that requires more skills in the work place and an improved basic education in mathematics and science. The digital age will also create greater opportunities for telecommuting, and already strong trends towards globalization will accelerate.  CHANGING SKILL REQUIREMENTS Demand for workers in IT industries and workers with occupations focused on the design, programming, maintenance and repair of the computing and communications infrastructure will continue to grow. In 1996, more than 7 million people worked in these jobs and they earned an average annual wage of just under $46,000. Over the next ten years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that an additional 2 million workers will be needed to fill these jobs. Companies already report difficulties in filling these positions today. Workers with information technology skills are needed across the economy. An analysis of IT occupations shows that the demand for workers to fill higher-skilled IT jobs (computer engineers, scientists, and systems analysts) is expected to grow from 874,000 in 1996 to 1.8 million by 2006.96 These positions typically require a four-year undergraduate degree, often in a field of science, mathematics or engineering, and in many cases, advanced training or a graduate degree. Employment in lesser-skilled jobs like computer operators and duplicating machine operators is expected to decline from 481,000 in 1996 to 342,000 by 2006. As electronic commerce becomes more widespread, it, too, will likely drive changes in the labor market. In most cases, the share of sales generated by a company's Web business is still only a small fraction of the company's total business. As it increases, however, the composition of the workforce required to produce and deliver a product or service may shift. For instance, if online delivery of news services replaces some portion of the conventionally delivered news, workers may gradually shift away from the printing or delivery of newspapers to the creation of content or managing of computers. Workers manning printing presses, driving trucks, and staffing news stands have no role in online news distribution. Their function is 46   performed by new workers responsible for programming, operating and maintaining the computer servers that ""distribute"" the news to Web readers. The same could be true for retail as online sales begin to substitute for in-store sales. Today, a super store might be staffed by a few hundred employees. Warehouse personnel receive new merchandise into the store and keep the shelves and bins filled. Salespeople advise customers on product features, check availability of merchandise not found on the shop floor, and book special orders. Cashiers ring up the sale and bag the goods. Back-office staff keep track of inventory and sales patterns, pay vendors and payroll, deposit sales receipts, and manage the day-to-day store operations. Other workers keep the store and its grounds clean and well-maintained. A retail sale via the Internet does not require the presence of a physical store or the same intensity of staff in order to generate the sale. Virtual retailers will hire people with IT skills to develop and program software, and operate and maintain computer servers and networks. They will also need marketing staff, accounting departments, customer service representatives and people skilled in graphic design to keep their Web site, or ""storefront,"" attractive and user friendly. Whether a retailer handles the physical distribution of its own products or contracts with another company to perform that function, warehouse and distribution personnel will continue to be necessary to transport products from the manufacturer's site to the customer's home. Retailers with an existing store infrastructure are likely to position the online business as complementary to their traditional store business, at least in the near term. Until online sales are of a size to warrant a dedicated distribution strategy, traditional retailers may choose to deliver goods to Web customers from the nearest store location, adding to the workload of existing warehouse personnel. Other retailers may choose to have manufacturers package and mail or ""drop ship"" goods directly to customers without going through any intermediate steps. Or, they may outsource the entire logistics process for the online business to a third party. In any of these scenarios, few store personnel would be involved in an online sale. Jobs characterized by a transfer of information from one party to another--travel agents, insurance agents, stock brokers, customer service representatives--will likely see routine tasks like order taking disappear, and more complicated tasks replacing them. For instance, a leisure traveler making plans to go home for the holidays usually knows all the carriers flying that route and simply needs to make the reservation and pay for the flight. That would be a case of order taking, a function as easily performed online as by calling the airline or a travel agent. On the other hand, a couple planning a trip to South Africa might seek the advice of someone who has been to the region, who can recommend hotels in the wine country near Cape Town and safaris in Kruger. Similarly, someone purchasing a term life policy with a face value of $400,000 may feel comfortable enough researching and purchasing that policy online. To help make the decision of whether to buy a whole or variable life insurance policy or put the money into an Individual Retirement Account or other investment vehicle, however, he might prefer to consult an expert in person.  47   WORKFORCE FLEXIBILITY Workforce flexibility refers to a company's ability to produce products and services with less rigid organizational structures. It also refers to a worker's ability to work without being tied to a desk or an office. The growth in information technology has played an important role in both driving the need for a new work force and in enabling greater flexibility in the work place. In the old model of industrial organization, production workers performed tasks by rote, over and over again throughout a shift. A car frame rolled down an assembly line, a worker attached a part, it proceeded to the next worker who performed the next process, and on it continued until a completed car emerged at the other end. A bank teller opened accounts, accepted deposits and provided account balance information. Someone else handled transactions involving Certificates of Deposit, Money Market Accounts and safety deposit boxes. Bureaucratic work organizations are giving way to flexible ""cells"" and teams that cross the oncerigid lines of job description, management reporting structures, and business units. This transformation often results from a corporate objective to implement total quality management (TQM) and Six Sigma (a benchmark of nearly zero defects) systems throughout their organizations. Reducing errors and return rates, lowering cycle times and reducing costs means getting it done right the first time. People on the ""front lines"" - - the factory floor, the sales department, the customer service organization - - need to have the education and information to make decisions and solve problems. Companies with successful TQM and Six Sigma initiatives invest heavily in training and education. They also give employees the tools they need: clearlystated objectives and real-time feedback on how well those objectives are being met. A robust computer network with online training and support tools can reinforce (or substitute for) inclassroom training sessions. It also keeps workers up-to-date with the latest forecasts, the current day's production or sales requirements, materials shortages, and other information in order to better perform the day's tasks and anticipate future needs. As more companies move to this method of work organization, the need to share information and knowledge across the enterprise will increase. Internal corporate networks and the Internet will play an important role in enabling this transition. Thanks to personal computers, fax machines, modems and cellular phones, as many as seven million workers in the United States work at home in ""virtual offices.""97 The Department of Transportation estimates that up to 15 million workers may be telecommuting in the next decade. Organizations with telecommuting programs report an increase in productivity, faster completion of assignments, fewer sick or absent days, better time management and increased morale and commitment to the company. They also benefit from reduced office space needs and associated costs, an enhanced ability to attract and retain quality employees, and improved customer service.98  48   Telecommuting benefits employees, as well. For those who need to balance work commitments with family commitments, telecommuting provides the means for working and communicating with coworkers and clients from home. Employees working part-time can manage their time more effectively, spending less time driving to one or more offices, and instead focusing on completing work assignments.  GLOBALIZATION Information technology has opened up new opportunities for global commerce. The signals transmitted over the Internet do not recognize national borders. Work on the same project can be done in several places or several countries without workers having to physically relocate. Organizations can now deploy resources and operations around the world. Information about new product introductions, corporate earnings, forecasted sales patterns, and materials requirements can be shared almost instantaneously via corporate e-mail systems and value-added networks, and now, over the Internet. Developing software, designing a car, providing consulting services to a client, can be done collaboratively by teams of employees from different parts of the world. For instance, an engineer in California can send an e-mail at the close of her business day to a colleague in Singapore, asking him to look over the attached design specifications for a new product. By the time she arrives for work the next morning, a reply could be sitting in her ""in-box"" with a marked-up set of specifications. With the opportunities come serious challenges. Countries that have an insufficient supply of skilled workers will see high-skilled, high-paying jobs migrate to countries that can supply the needed talent. Those that have a surplus will find job opportunities opening for their workers in overseas organizations. Even though the United States has led the world into the digital age, we face these same realities. Without a concerted effort to develop students and workers to meet the new challenges of the digital economy, the United States could face a migration of high-skilled, high-wage jobs to other countries.  49   CHAPTER EIGHT: CHALLENGES AHEAD  This report has focused on the emergence of the digital economy--the promise it contains and some of the challenges it poses. Some of the challenges are technical, others involve the development of standards, and still others require significant capital investments. The digital revolution is also changing the respective roles of government and the private sector. In the 19th and for much of the 20th centuries, governments played a key role in helping build or actively regulate much of the country's infrastructure. The federal government made extensive land grants to encourage private capital to expand the nation's rail network. Government subsidies were used to stimulate the development of an airline industry. Federal and state dollars combined to build and maintain the interstate highway system. In communications, the government granted a virtual monopoly to a single company and regulated the industry after its breakup. Most power companies have been regulated monopolies at the state or federal level. The federal government funded and developed early versions of the Internet for national security and research purposes. It will continue to provide funding for research and development on future Internet and high-performance computing technologies. However, most of the capital to build the computing and telecommunications infrastructure is being provided by the private sector. The pace of technological development and the borderless environment created by the Internet drives a new paradigm for government and private sector responsibilities. Creating the optimal conditions for the new digital economy to flourish requires a new, much less restrictive approach to the setting of rules.  Governments must allow electronic commerce to grow up in an environment driven by markets, not burdened with extensive regulation, taxation or censorship. While government actions will not stop the growth of electronic commerce, if they are too intrusive, progress can be substantially impeded. Where possible, rules for the Internet and electronic commerce should result from private collection action, not government regulation. Governments do have a role to play in supporting the creation of a predictable legal environment globally for doing business on the Internet, but must exercise this role in a non-bureaucratic fashion. Greater competition in telecommunications and broadcast industries should be encouraged so that high-bandwidth services are brought to homes and offices around the world and so 50         that the new converged market place of broadcast, telephony and the Internet operate based on laws of competition and consumer choice rather than those of government regulation.   There should be no discriminatory taxation against Internet commerce. The Internet should function as a seamless global marketplace with no artificial barriers erected by governments.  As with any major societal transformation, the digital economy will foster change and some upheaval. The Industrial Revolution brought great economic and social benefit, but it also brought about massive dislocations of people, increased industrial pollution, unhealthy child labor and unsafe work environments. Societies were often slow in responding to these negative side effects. Similarly, the digital economy may bring potential invasions of privacy, easier access by children to pornographic and violent materials and hate speech, more sophisticated and far-reaching criminal activity and a host of other as-yet unknown problems. The private sector and government, working together, must address these problems in ways that make the Internet a safe environment while not impeding its commercial development. The U.S. Government's ""Global Framework for Electronic Commerce,"" posted on the Internet at http://www.ecommerce.gov, describes a market-driven framework that will stimulate the growth of the digital economy while offering flexible, industry-driven solutions that will effectively address problems that may arise. Steps are now being taken in the United States and around the world to meet these public policy goals. Perhaps the greatest challenge the U.S. faces, however, is to put in place the human resource policies necessary for the digital economy. If the trends described in this study continue, millions of jobs will likely be created, while millions of others will be lost. The good news is that the net economic growth anticipated by this digital revolution will likely create more jobs than those that are lost. Further, the jobs created are likely to be higher-skilled and higher-paying than those that will be displaced. However, it is clear that we will face great challenges in preparing the current workforce and future workers to fill the new jobs that will be created. If we do not have a sufficient number of well-educated and trained people to fill these jobs, then the good news can turn to bad. If these public policy issues can be resolved, and electronic commerce is allowed to flourish, the digital economy could accelerate world economic growth well into the next century.  51   ENDNOTES  1.

Others believe that IT has not had a measurable impact on productivity because businesses have not yet reorganized their operations in order to take advantage of information technology. They note that the lag between investments and their full payoff generally takes many years.

Forbes. July 7, 1997. pp.144-171. Thomas Newcomen developed the first practical steam engine in 1712, used primarily for pumping water out of mines. This engine was only practical near a source of wood or coals. James Watt's steam engine of 1769 added a separate condenser which increased the fuel efficiency by a factor of four. Due to this addition, a steam engine could be put anywhere and the fuel hauled to it. In 1782, Watt modified the engine by introducing a rotary motion that could turn a shaft. Michael Faraday first harnessed electricity in 1831 by means of motion in a magnetic field.

In the early days of the Internet, most messages were simple text that did not require large amounts of bandwidth. Bandwidth requirements have increased as people began to send images, sound, software, video and voice over the Internet. In a packet-switched system, a message is broken into chunks and each chunk or ""packet"" is individually addressed and individually routed across the network to its destination. At the destination, the message is reassembled. Packets that do not arrive at the destination are retransmitted. As Vint Cerf, one of the inventors of the Internet, describes it: Packet switching is conceptually similar to the way the postal service works. That is, each letter or postcard is individually addressed and moves geographically from point-to-point as it travels towards its destination. Two postcards mailed from a post office in San Francisco may take different routes to New York, but once they arrive at the New York City post office, they are assembled with the other mail going to the destination address and delivered. Each ""packet"" is like a postcard and network routers are like the mail stops along the way. Meeker, Mary and Pearson, Sharon. Morgan Stanley U.S. Investment Research: Internet Retail. Morgan Stanley. May 28, 1997. pp.2-2, 2-6. Notes: Data for TV and other media are U.S. figures. PC figures reflect worldwide users. Morgan Stanley uses the launch of HBO in 1976 as their estimate for the beginning of cable. ""Though cable technology was developed in the late 1940's, its initial use was primarily for the improvement of reception in remote areas. It was not until HBO began to distribute its pay-TV movie service via satellite in 1976 that the medium became a distinct content and advertising alternative to broadcast television."" In 1989, the World Wide Web (WWW) protocols for transferring hypertext via the Internet were first used in experimental form at the European Center for Particle Research 53  11. 12. 13. 14. 15.  16.  17.  18.   (CERN) in Switzerland. In 1991, the National Science Foundation lifted the restrictions on the commercial use of the Internet. That same year, the World Wide Web (WWW) was released by CERN. In 1993, the alpha version of Mosaic, the graphical user interface to the WWW, was released, giving non-technical users the ability to navigate the Internet. This report uses 1993 as the date when the Internet became truly open to the public. See: Cerf, Vint. ""The Internet Phenomenon."" National Science Foundation Web page. Http://www.cise.nsf.gov/general/compsci/net/cerf.html No exact figures exist on Internet usage worldwide, but different sources point to 1997 as the year when Internet usage approaches/crosses the 50 million mark. For instance, NUA, an Internet consultancy and developer, compiles figures from different research analysts and finds the following ranges of Internet usage: 1995: 8-30 million, 1996: 28-40 million, 1997: >100 million.

As new investments in fiber, satellite, wireless and cable are made, more of the world will be connected to the Internet. One billion people on the Internet by 2005 could therefore be possible.

Forrester Research. July 1997. Forrester Research predicts that business-to-business electronic commerce will reach $327 billion by 2002. A conservative estimate for the combined online transactions for Cisco, Dell and GE in 1997 would be $3 billion. During the first 10 months of 1997, Cisco booked more than $1 billion in sales via the Internet. Although Dell did not report its 1997 sales via the Internet, a rough estimate would place them between $750 million - $1 billion for the year. GE reports having purchased over $1 billion online in 1997. In three to five years' time, Internet commerce for the three companies will, by their own estimates, reach or exceed $17 billion. Cisco expects online sales to grow to 60 percent of total volume over the next year. If analyst projections for Cisco to grow to a $10.5 billion company by July of 1999 are correct, Cisco's online sales will reach $5-6 billion by then. Dell expects to conduct half its total business online shortly after the year 2000. Even taking 50 percent of its current volume ($12 billion in 1997 and growing rapidly) would lead to $6 billion in online sales shortly after the year 2000. By 2000, GE aims to have all 12 of its business units purchasing via the Internet, for a total of $5 billion.  47.  48. 49. 50. 51.  52.  53.  54.

In the process it gave fillip to increased penetration of cheap imports, especially from Asia and Latin America, at the disadvantage of the domestic (furniture) industry. The industry lost market share in spite of a strong housing market over the last years.1 This process shows no signs of stopping and the industry continues to lose market share relative to imports. This is attributable largely to globalization friendly nuances including the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA, Free Trade Area of the Americas  FTAA, and the World Trade Organization - WTO, which favors wider market access. According to Buehlmann and Schuler, imports now equal 53 percent of domestic U.S. furniture production and account for 33 percent of U.S. consumption2, thereby flattening domestic furniture production, further eroding jobs. The numbers forcefully tell the story. Between 2000 and 2001, for example, the U.S. furniture industry lost more than 36,000 jobs (6.5 percent of nationwide employment) according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.3 According to the North Carolina Employment Security Commission (ESC), in 2000 (the most recent annual data available), the North Carolina furniture industry employed 1,015 (1.3 percent) less people than it did a year prior. In the third quarter of 2001 (most recent quarter available), furniture employment dipped more than 10 percent compared to the same period a year earlier, a record of 7,852 job losses.4 Between 1990 and 2000, the furniture employment level dropped sharply from 85,178 to 76,220, shedding almost 9,000 jobs or more than 10 percent of industry's employment.5 This trend accelerated significantly in 2001, when almost 10,000 jobs were lost in one year (a loss of 12.8 percent of the total workforce employed in the North Carolina furniture industry in 2000).6 At the same time, new investments, capitalization, and modernization are in dire straits; while industry analysts forecast continuing anxiety in the furniture sector. Specific findings of this study include:  From 1980 to 1990, the North Carolina furniture industry averaged 84,578 jobs per year compared to 77,666 average jobs in the period from 1991 to 2000, a difference of more than 6,900 jobs or 8.2 percent. From 1980 to 1990, the North Carolina furniture industry recorded a 3,163 net job gain compared to a 2,664 net job loss in the period from 1991 to 2000, indicating more than a 84 percent net job loss. From 1980 to 1990, the North Carolina average annual percent of furniture jobs to total manufacturing employment was 10.2 percent compared to 9.3 percent in the period from 1991 to 2000, declining almost 1 percent.      page 4   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler    In the period from 1980 to 1990, North Carolina's total furniture employment establishment net gain was 192 or 30.3 percent, compared to 47 establishments closings (-5.5 percent) in the period from 1991-2000. Consistent with statewide trends, all of North Carolina's seven Economic Development Regions (data for North Carolina's Eastern region was suppressed for confidentiality reasons) lost furniture jobs in the period from 1991 to 2000. The hardest hit Region was the Piedmont Triad which lost more than 3,700 jobs or 12.5 percent, AdvantageWest lost 1,731 jobs or 8.1 percent and, the Charlotte Region where 1,591 jobs or 6.4 percent were lost. The Research Triangle Partnership shed 1,006 jobs or 33.5 percent, North Carolina's Southeast lost 816 jobs or 56.3 percent, and Global TransPark gave up 420 jobs or 31.3 percent of its total in the furniture manufacturing area. In the period from 1990 to 2000, all of North Carolina's seven Economic Development Regions except AdvantageWest and Research Triangle (data for North Carolina's Eastern region was suppressed for confidentiality reasons) experienced furniture plant closings. Piedmont Triad recorded the highest rate at 31, North Carolina's Southeast region 20, Charlotte Region 9, and Global TransPark 4. Relative to the Southeast region, between 1990 and 2000 North Carolina lost more than 8,000 furniture jobs compared to furniture job gains recorded by our closest economic development rivals, Alabama (7,300 or 24.7%), Georgia (2,000 or 20.2%), and South Carolina (200 or 4.5%). Only Virginia was a net loser of employment like North Carolina during this period. However, Virginia lost ""only"" 1,600 furniture jobs. Furniture manufacturing is important to North Carolina, employing almost 10 percent of the state's manufacturing workforce (76,400 jobs), more than 50 percent of these five states' total.        In the final analysis, the issue of globalization is not to ""disenfranchise"" people economically. Rather, to empower as many people and corporate entities as possible to share in the benefits that globalization offers including ""lowering costs, expanding choices, and delivering more capital, giving the individual more power to succeed."" Consequently, what is required are adequate policy measures and selective support of the industry that will help to ameliorate the negative impact of globalization on North Carolina's furniture industry and make the industry a globally competitive force. Short-run efforts could be directed at delivering effective corporate and civic leadership, helping the industry partnering with competitors to lower costs and leveraging the companies through easier financing. The industry needs to evaluate its business models, evaluate product lines, become more efficient and diversify their markets, among other things. Schuler and Buehlmann, in a forthcoming USDA Forest Service General Technical Report entitled ""Identifying future competitive business page 5   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  strategies for the U.S. furniture industry: benchmarking and paradigm shifts"", are trying to outline some potential strategies for the survival of the domestic furniture industry.7 In the long run, the state's effort could be directed at supporting the industry by strengthening the furniture ""center of excellence"" in North Carolina. This includes improving infrastructure, offering up-to-date training opportunities for the industry, supporting the industry through outreach and reasonable laws in addition to pursuing all the possibilities inherent in trade policies.  page 6   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  I. INTRODUCTION Globalization and free trade is here to stay and North Carolina must deal with it. While globalization has boosted world trade and economic output, continued to break national economic barriers, raised living standards, bolstered international investments and movement of capital, induced technology efficiency and reduced costs, it has made life difficult for people and industries dislocated by the change. North Carolina's furniture industry is no exception. While globalization may not be totally responsible for the dwindling fortunes of North Carolina's traditional manufacturing sector including the furniture industry, it is strongly linked to the decline of the furniture industry. As a result of globalization many North Carolina furniture companies have adopted cost cutting measures to counter especially the problem of domestic ""high production costs""8 and other overheads. Strategies of North Carolina manufacturers also include offshore outsourcing and contracting out to low wage countries in Asia and Latin America, effectively spurring the erosion of many local furniture jobs and plant closings. A recent report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that while manufacturing unit labor costs (labor compensation per unit of output) declined in competitive countries including Japan (-6.0 percent), Korea (-4.0 percent), and Taiwan (-3.5 percent) in 2000, it went up by 1.4 percent in the United States.9 This exacerbates the tendency for United States' manufacturers to move operations to low labor cost overseas countries, consequently shedding local jobs. In the same vein, another related report indicated that United State's furniture wage rates were higher than those of the competition including Mexico, Taiwan, and Hong Kong by up to 80 percent,11 further luring U.S. manufacturers to relocate overseas, invariably jeopardizing local manufacturing jobs. The world economy including the United States has undergone major transformations in the past decades. The pace of change has been dramatic since the end of the Cold War and the ascendancy of information and Internet technology. North Carolina is no exception to this paradigm shift. Aside from the relaxation of Cold War tensions and the Internet revolution, another major force driving this unprecedented economic change is the reality of economic globalization as expressed in free trade. Free trade has opened new markets, sharpened the relevance of a knowledge based global economy and, at the same time, created new challenges in its wake. To prosper, the North Carolina furniture industry must tap into the globalization bonanza, and, at the  Establishments engaged in manufacturing household, office, public building, restaurant furniture, and office and store fixtures  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC 25) or North American Industry Classification System (NAICS 3371).    page 7   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  same time, find ways to ameliorate the negative side effects of the globalization imperativeb. Unfortunately, not only has North Carolina's furniture industry not taken full advantage of the globalization windfall, but also globalization has taken a heavy toll on the fortunes of this industry. Layoffs and plant closings, a growing dislocated worker problem, comparative disadvantages, outdated technology, consolidations, downsizing, mergers, restructurings, etc., are all signs of the growing problem that one of North Carolina's major industries face. Between 1990 and 2000 (the most recent annual data available), for example, North Carolina lost nearly 9,000 furniture industry jobs (almost 10 percent of its original employment).12 This disturbing trend accelerated significantly in 2001, where almost 10,000 jobs were lost (a loss of 12.8 percent of the total workforce employed at the NC furniture industry in 2000).13 This trend, according to preliminary data, is continuing. More disturbing, there seem to be no measures in place to properly address both real and potential problems facing the industry in the aftermath of globalization. What is globalization? How widespread are the impacts of, and what are the consequences of globalization on North Carolina's furniture industry? And what are the implications for public policy? Globalization No consensus on the definition of globalization exists. For the purposes of this study, globalization is defined as the ""increasing economic integration of the world economy.""14 Globalization is not a new phenomenon. In fact, it is a well established economic practice expressed in various forms, such as, international trade (imports and exports), foreign direct investments (firms investing in other countries), capital market flows (foreign and domestic sources of funds including bonds, equities, loans), region specific market bloc alliances (e.g. North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA, Free Trade Area of the Americas  FTAA, European Union - EU) and global trade pacts (e.g. the World Trade Organization- WTO, etc.). Yet, not until the dawn of the 1990s did the concept of globalization begin to take hold. Since then, global markets and institutions continued to grow in importance. Several studies indicate that the chief cause of this development is technological progress, especially, the emergence of the Information Age epitomized by the Internet and the ""availability of cheap, rapid, and reliable communications that have cut both This report focuses on the furniture industry  however, the reader should keep in mind that there are significant downstream and upstream industries supporting the furniture industry. For example, the wood products industry (of which furniture itself is a part) without furniture has about the same size and importance as the furniture industry and is far larger if wooden building construction is included. Thus, trends discussed in this report have a multiplier effect throughout North Carolina's economy. b  page 8   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  communication and transportation costs""15 and the emergence of containerized shipping technology. In tandem, the spread of consumer knowledge, influencing markets like never before, has required markets to offer more choices and lower prices, a process that is ongoing. Businesses also realized the competitive advantages of producing their products in countries that have a comparative advantage, one of which often is low labor costs. Such advantages offered and offers developing countries an opportunity for economic growth and increased prosperity. The outstanding example of this development is China, which tries hard to increase prosperity of its citizens and provide jobs to everyone17 to keep the pseudo communist party in power. Evidently, the North Carolina furniture industry is not immune to these globalization boosting agents and the accompanying consequences. Latest figures from the U.S. Census Bureau,18 for example, show that, whereas total U.S. retail sales for the first quarter of 2002 were estimated at $743.8 billion, an increase of 2.7 percent from the same period a year earlier, U.S. e-commercec retail sales (unadjusted) for the first quarter of 2002 was $9.849 billion, an increase of 19.3 percent from the first quarter of 2001 (more than seven times the increase of traditional retail sales). In fact, U.S. e-commerce retail sales has almost doubled since the first quarter of 1999 (when tracking started) from $5.481 billion to $9.849 billion in the first quarter of 2002. Akin to technological advances is the wind of economic liberalization sweeping the world enhanced by the relaxation of Cold War tensions, diminishing national boundaries, improved international understanding, easing trade barriers, rising capital flows and financial exchanges, increasing penetration of technological knowledge, and ever increasing use of computers, to mention a few. Purpose of the Study This study examines the impact of globalization on North Carolina's traditional manufacturing industries particularly the furniture industry. While the phenomena of globalization is extensively researched and documented, none has focused specifically on the effect of globalization on North Carolina's furniture industry. Yet, such a study is of crucial importance to the State, because:  The State's furniture industry employs roughly 10 percent of all manufacturing workforce19 mainly in rural, economically less developed rural areas and shipped $8.02 billions in product in 2000, which is 4.5% of North Carolina's total manufactured value of shipments ($178.01 billion).20 The furniture  c  According to U.S. Department of Commerce, ""E-commerce sales are sales of goods and services where an order is placed by the buyer or price and terms of sale are negotiated over an Internet, extranet, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) network, electronic mail, or other online system. Payment may or may not be made online.""  page 9   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  industry added a net $4.2 billion of value to its product in 2000 (4.6 percent), of a total of $92.46 billion in manufacturing value added in 2000 in North Carolina.  Furniture also is a major user of lumber and wood products supplied by the many suppliers throughout the state. A significant part of the roughly $4.86 billion in value added in 200021 in this supplying industry are consumed by the State's furniture industry. Other industries, such as, retailing, packaging, and transportation among many others, directly depend on the furniture industry  creating what Porter calls a ""Center of Excellence.""22 The State's lead economic development agency, the Department of Commerce, vis--vis the Division of Policy, Research, and Strategic Planning's ""think tank"" role, among others, is to evaluate watershed economic events that have direct impact on the lives, jobs, careers, and well-being of our citizens by analyzing, interpreting, and communicating those events in a succinct and easy to understand manner. At the same time the division is supposed to suggest appropriate policy issues and strategies on a continuing basis to policymakers. The State's land grant University, North Carolina State University, which is home to the Department of Wood and Paper Science and the Wood Products Extension group, among other entities, has a vital interest in evaluating and analyzing the state of this major industry. Based on such analytic work, conclusions can be drawn to support the industry through extension, research, and teaching. As a core industry and major employer in the state, identifying what ails the furniture industry in the aftermath of globalization is likely to add value to better understanding the challenges facing similar North Carolina industries. Measures suggested here to revamp the beleaguered furniture industry could be proposed, if applicable, to other industries similarly situated.          Scope of the Study In order to better understand the influences of globalization on North Carolina's furniture industry, a long-term (1980-2000) trend examination was conducted. The study time period is divided into two comparative phases, 1) 1980-1990 and 2) 19912000. We call phase 1 (1980-1990) the ""globalization neutral"" period and phase 2 (1991-2000) the ""globalization sensitive"" period. This trend analysis is preferred because it shields employment data against distortions inherent in short run data sets  page 10   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  due to fluctuations in business cycles. The impact analysis covers North Carolina and its seven Economic Development Regions/Partnerships. d Furthermore, furniture employment and wages data for the Southeaste region of the United States (composed of North Carolina and 11 neighboring states) are examined. Special attention is given to North Carolina's closest ""rivals"", Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. These three states are North Carolina's main competitors in respect to economic development. Therefore, they will serve as an index for comparing the impacts of globalization on the State's furniture industry relative to them. Sources of Data Historical data on furniture employment and wages from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and North Carolina Employment Security Commission for the period 1980 to 2000 were utilized to conduct the analysis. Also, furniture business closings and permanent layoffs data from the North Carolina Employment Security Commission (ESC) were utilized to show furniture plants establishment concentration (Figure 11) across the state, particularly, in the seven economic development partnerships.

NORTH CAROLINA FURNITURE INDUSTRY TODAY Furniture is to North Carolina as apple pie is to America. North Carolina has the envious reputation of producing ""more than half of all home furniture used in the United States,""23 and, for almost a century now, has been described as the ""furniture capital of the world."" This concentration of furniture manufacturing in a small region, e.g. a ""Center of Excellence""24, is widely seen as a competitive advantage, which is not easily repeated by other regions or countries. As one of the state's mainstay industries, furniture is the second (after textile mills) largest factory sector employer, engaging almost 10 percent of the state's manufacturing employment, expending more than $2 billion in annual wages. Furniture's gross state product (GSP), in current dollars, jumped to $3.2 billion in 2000, up 60 percent from $2.0 billion in 1990.25 (See Figure 1.)

Annual average wage per worker rose a remarkable 68 percent from $10,712.92 in 1980 to $17,970 in 1990. It accelerated to $21,732 in 1995 and soared to $27,288 in 200026 (See Figure 2).

Note: Data for years 1980-1992 are on hardcopy. However, overall, North Carolina's furniture industry is in decline and faces considerable pressure from globalization (Figure 3). Between 2000 and 2001, for example, the U.S. furniture industry lost more than 36,000 jobs (6.5 percent) according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.27 According to the North Carolina Employment Security Commission (ESC), in 2000, North Carolina's furniture industry employed 1,015 (1.3 percent) less people than it did a year prior. However, 2000 was the last year of strong economic growth. Since then with the weakening economy and increasing market pressures from imports, the job losses in the State increased. In 2001, when the weakening economy softened demand for furniture, North Carolina lost 9,741 jobs (12.8 percent) of its furniture employment, a trend that is continuing in 2002. These problems will remain with us for the foreseeable future, no matter the economic development of the next few years. A continuing sluggish economy simply will page 13   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  increase and speed up further loss of employment, but even in the best economic scenario, the decline of manufacturing capacity will continue. In the third quarter of 2001 alone, furniture employment dipped by almost 10 percent compared to the same period a year earlier, for a record loss of 7,852 jobs.28 This is on top of the loss in employment experienced between 1990 and 2000. During this time period (the ""globalization sensitive"" period), furniture employment levels dropped sharply from 85,178 to 76,220, shedding almost 9,000 jobs, or more than 10 percent of industry's employment29. Most analysts predict no end to this development, as there is still significant outdated manufacturing capacity in operation. At the same time, due to the difficult economic times, new investments, capitalization, and modernization are in dire straits. With the domestic markets facing strong import pressures, the North Carolina furniture exports do not offer an alternative market. Although exports, after sliding between 1996 and 2000, rebounded modestly in 2001 by 0.58 percent to $215.6 million from the previous year.30 However, exports are less than 4 percent31 of total production in the State. This indicates that, whereas the industry is losing market share due to imported furniture, it does not take advantage of open foreign markets, e.g. the State's manufacturing industry isn't able to benefit from globalization so far. This marginal performance of the state's furniture industry clearly is also due to a strong U.S. dollar, making exports unduly expensive to buy abroad. However, some experts believe that the exchange rate is only part of the problem, but that outdated products and not so stellar quality carry part of the blame, too. North Carolina furniture manufacturers are making efforts to respond to the challenges of globalization. However, the low profitability, which is typically earned in the furniture business, makes sufficient re-investment in plants, equipment, and human labor difficult. The low profitability of the industry not only reduces the capital available for reinvestment, but clearly it also defers the infusion of new capital into the industry since more profitable alternatives exist. Statistics show that the U.S. furniture industry re-invests a lower percentage of the value of shipments than do other industries (furniture industry roughly 2 percent versus the average of all U.S. manufacturing industries approximately 3 percent32). Investments in new technologies and automated processes, improving existing procedures, and adopting new marketing strategies are made in a piecemeal fashion. Hickory Chair (Hickory, NC), for example, uses ""Celaschi double-end tenoners"" and ""Morbidelli"" in their Conover, North Carolina plant. Both pieces of equipments are reflective of new high-speed wood processing technology that has helped the company increase output, reduce job set-up time by 60 percent, provide greater manufacturing flexibility, and aid the performance of multiple tasks on the same machine.33 Other survival measures being pursued by North Carolina furniture companies include plant upgrades, product customization and diversification, development of niche markets, export revitalization, skills renewal, and improved customer service. However, some experts doubt that such piecemeal page 14   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  improvements are sufficient to guarantee the survival of a substantial manufacturing base in North Carolina.34 For the industry to survive and prosper, a paradigm shift is needed.35  page 15   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  Figure 3: Furniture Plant Closings & Layoffs 2001-2002 (50 or more Job Losses) Year 2001 Company Alexvale Furniture Inc.

IMPACT OF GLOBALIZATION While globalization is not responsible alone for the bane of North Carolina's furniture industry, this study goes a long way to confirm growing anecdotal evidence that globalization has taken a serious toll, especially on jobs in North Carolina's traditional manufacturing sector including furniture (Figure 3). As a result of globalization (which has opened more borders), many U.S. furniture companies (NC's companies among them), have adopted cost cutting measures to counter the problem of domestic ""high production costs""36 and other overheads by outsourcing and contracting out to, particularly, low wage countries in Asia and Latin America. Wholesale-imported furniture is, besides domestically in-house manufactured products, for many companies, a way to stay in business.37,38 Other companies decide to completely abandon domestic manufacturing to become pure wholesalers focusing on selling furniture procured from offshore manufacturers.39 Others just cease operation and go out of business.40 A recent report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, for example, showed that while manufacturing unit labor costs (labor compensation per unit of output) declined in 2000 in competitive countries especially in Asia including Japan by 6.0 percent, Korea 4.0 percent, and Taiwan 3.5 percent, it went up by 1.4 percent in the United States.41 These labor cost fluctuations are not only due to actual costs in the different economies, but also a function of exchange rates, among other things. Such cost differentials exacerbate the tendency for United States manufacturers to move operations overseas in order to cut costs, consequently shedding local jobs. Another study indicated that the United States' furniture wage rates were higher than those of the competition including Mexico, Taiwan, and Hong Kong by up to 80 percent.43 At the same pace as North Carolina's furniture manufacturers contract out the manufacture of furniture to foreign places, imports from these places increase.  page 17   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  Figure 4: U.S. Furniture Imports and Exports ($000s) Selected Countries, 19992001 Country China India Indonesia Korea Malaysia Taiwan Thailand Argentina Brazil Mexico 1999 Imports $3,791,590 $67,363 $523,352 $82,084 $537,089 $1,138,924 $304,546 $107,813 $99,125 $2,908,577 2001 % Change Imports 1999-2001 $5,818,042 53.4 $107,338 59.3 $594,665 13.6 $81,291 -1.0 $495,144 -7.8 $857,992 -24.7 $343,829 12.9 $229,037 112.4 $185,275 86.9 $3,238,015 11.3 Country China India Indonesia Korea Malaysia Taiwan Thailand Argentina Brazil Mexico 1999 Exports $44,855 $3,399 $3,480 $16,460 $6,252 $20,804 $8,362 $12,394 $36,529 $797,312 2001 % Change Exports 1999-2001 $50,781 13.2 $3,816 12.3 $4,215 21.1 $24,162 46.8 $7,737 23.8 $14,309 -31.2 $8,070 -3.5 $12,523 1.0 $25,624 -29.9 $968,526 21.5  Source: U.S. Census, Foreign Trade Division. http://www.census.gov/foreigntrade/www Globalization has encouraged the relaxation of import control rules and, in the process, given fillip to increased market penetration of imported cheap furniture, especially from Asia and Latin America, at the disadvantage of the domestic furniture industry (Figure 4). The domestic industry is losing market share in spite of a strong housing market (according to the U.S. Census Bureau between 2000 and 2001 new housing increased by almost 3 percent). The import preference problem is reinforced by globalization friendly nuances including the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA, Free Trade Area of the Americas  FTAA, and the World Trade Organization - WTO, which favors more open markets (imports now equal 53 percent of domestic U.S. furniture production and account for 33 percent of U.S. furniture consumption and is rising rapidly44), thereby flattening domestic furniture production, further eliminating jobs. The impact of globalization can be demonstrated, for example, in: North Carolina Furniture Employment Trends 1980-1990 and 1991-2000 Figure 5 shows the total number of manufacturing and furniture jobs in North Carolina from 1980 to 1990, the annual average number of manufacturing and furniture jobs, the net job change from 1980 to 1990, and the percent change from 1980 to 1990. In addition, it shows the percentage of furniture employment to total manufacturing employment for the period under review. Furthermore, it shows the average percentage of furniture jobs to total manufacturing employment, and average number of furniture establishments. Total manufacturing employment increased 34,434 or 4.2 percent from 1980 to 1990. Total furniture employment grew 3,163 or nearly 4 percent during the same time period. Also, furniture's share of total manufacturing employment averaged page 18   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  10.2 percent during this period. Collectively, the furniture industry increased of total manufacturing employment from 1980 to 1990.

Beginning in 1990 and fueled by the 1990-91 recession, the once thriving furniture industry began to shrink. One of the major reasons for this was the onset of economic globalization marked by increasing across the border outsourcing, contracting out, and devolutions of operations which in effect spurred pervasive job losses in the local economy. By the middle of the decade, the furniture industry's misfortunes have reached near revolt buttressed by other mutually inclusive free trade factors, such as, the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA, Free Trade Area of the Americas  FTAA, World Trade Organization, WTO. Figure 7 has the same attributes as Figure 5 except that the data is for the 1991 to 2000 period. Total manufacturing employment decreased by 43,954 jobs or 5.3 percent between 1991 and 2000 compared to the 1980 to 1990 period. Total furniture employment fell by 2,664 jobs or 3.4 percent between 1991 and 2000 compared to the 1980 to 1990 period. Also, the average percentage of furniture jobs to total manufacturing employment decreased by 0.9 percent to 9.3 percent between 1991 and 2000 compared to 10.2 percent for the average of the 1980 to 1990 period.

Today, almost two thirds (66 percent) of domestic production is imported and market penetration of offshore furniture is fast reaching 50 percent.45 Furniture imports from China alone increased by more than $2 billion (a 53.4 percent increase) in only two years from 1999 to 2001. Whereas the statistics report a drop in furniture manufacturing employment from 1999 to 2000 of 1,015 jobs, North Carolina lost 3,474 jobs in 2001 in furniture plants closing with 50 or more job losses and another 2,191 jobs in 2002 through August for the same category46. Just how desperate the situation is and how rapidly the job losses are occurring is illustrated in Figure 9 below which summarizes number of employment over the time period from 1980 to 2001.  page 22   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  Figure 9: Summary of Employment Trends in North Carolina Furniture Industry 1980-2001 95,000  90,000  85,000  # of Jobs  80,000  75,000  70,000  65,000 Jobs  1980 82015  1981 83909  1982 79319  1983 80768  1984 85639  1985 84563  1986 84823  1987 87684  1988 90183  1989 86273  1990 85178  1991 78884  1992 78092  1993 79206  1994 79878  1995 78808  1996 76775  1997 75757  1998 75801  1999 77235  2000 76220  2001* 66479  * 4th quarter of 2001 Source: North Carolina Employment Security Commission There are strong indications that layoffs in 2002 will exceed the ones experienced in 2001, with Thomasville furniture announcing on September 20, 2002 that it will lay off another 425 employees in Thomasville, North Carolina.47 The data shows that the furniture industry, which accounts for roughly 10 percent of North Carolina's employment48 and adds $4.2 billions to the state economy49 per year, is contracting fast with no bottom in sight. If no decisive actions are taken to support the industry through public policy, education, and outreach, furniture manufacturing and with it many supporting industries (e.g. the Furniture Industry Cluster in North Carolina50) will soon be history. Besides the economic consequences for the State of North Carolina, the human side of this tragedy is illustrated in Bamberger's and Davidson's book, ""The Closing"".51 Yet many experts maintain, although dramatic changes in the way furniture is manufactured and sold are inevitable, that a prospering industry could be maintained by taking decisive action at public, industry and individual levels.52,53, 54  page 23   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  North Carolina Economic Development Partnerships North Carolina's Regions/Partnerships (region and partnership are used interchangeably) are the microcosm of the State and, whatever impacts the State by default affects the Partnerships. The furniture industry is no exception especially for Regions and counties heavily dependent on the furniture industry for jobs and tax revenues. There are seven Economic Development Partnerships in the State of North Carolina. The Partnerships were created in 1993 starting with three Commissions, namely, West, Northeast, and Southeast ""to provide a boost to the West, the Northeast, and Southeast areas of the state considered most needy of job growth, capital investment, and additional support from the Department of Commerce.""55 In 1994-1995, the regional concept was replicated statewide to include all 100 counties and expanded the number of Partnerships to seven ""to leverage efforts, expenditures, and programs to foster economic growth in all parts of the state.""56 Figure 10 shows the total number of furniture jobs in North Carolina's seven economic development partnerships from 1990 to 2000, the net job change, and the percent change. Furniture employment declined in all of the seven partnerships (data for North Carolina's East was suppressed for confidentiality reasons). The hardest hit Region was Piedmont Triad, losing more than 3,700 jobs or 12.5 percent, followed by AdvantageWest with 1,731 jobs or 8.1 percent and, Charlotte Region with 1,591 jobs or 6.4 percent. Research Triangle Partnership shed 1,006 jobs or 33.5 percent, North Carolina's Southeast 816 jobs or 56.3 percent, and Global TransPark 420 jobs or 31.3 percent.

Figure 13 shows the total number of furniture jobs in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia in 1990 and 2000, the percent share of furniture jobs to total manufacturing employment in 1990 and 2000, net furniture job change between 1990 and 2000, and the percent job change between 1990 and 2000. Between 1990 and 2000, Alabama's, Georgia's, and South Carolina's furniture jobs grew by 7,300 (24.7%); 2,000 (20.2%); and South Carolina 200 (4.5%); respectively, compared to North Carolina's loss of more than 8,000 (nearly 10%) of furniture employment during this period (Figures 13 and 14). Virginia also lost furniture employment, although only two thirds as much as did North Carolina on a percentage basis. Not only were Virginia's losses less pronounced than North Carolina's, but Virginia is much less page 26   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  dependent on furniture than is North Carolina. Virginia's share of employment in furniture is 5.6 percent, slightly more than half of North Carolina's 9.7 percent of all manufacturing employment. Also, while Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina increased their percent share of furniture jobs to total manufacturing employment, North Carolina's receded to 9.7 percent in 2000 from 9.8 percent in 1990. However, while the number of North Carolina's furniture job losses during the period under review was overwhelmingly higher than the rest, the result should be interpreted under consideration of the fact that North Carolina's 76,400 furniture jobs in 2000 was more than the combined total of 53,400 for Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. This just underlines the crucial importance of the furniture and wood products industries to the State. And by default, North Carolina's economy is impacted much more severely from furniture job losses due to unsavory economic events (for example, globalization), than are the other states. An interesting question to be asked would be why was North Carolina losing furniture related jobs when all the other states were adding employment to its furniture industry. This could indicate an unfavorable economic environment for furniture manufacturers in the State. Or it may partially be due to lower or missing support of the industry by the State, or a combination of both. More research into this area would be of high importance to allow corrective action to be taken and to support the existing manufacturing base in the State.

CONCLUSIONS The full impact of globalization on North Carolina's traditional industries, including furniture, may never be known in its entirety. Economic globalization has enhanced economic possibilities and eliminated barriers to free trade, but at the same time, it has left many individuals resentful and jobless and, the industries prostrate.57 The poignancy cannot be missed in the case of North Carolina's furniture industry. Although almost all of North Carolina's traditional industries are suffering under the weight of economic globalization, the wooden residential furniture industry segment has been especially hard hit. While total manufacturing employment, for example, declined by 6.4 percent or 50,500 jobs between 2000 and 2001, furniture employment fell 7.2 percent or 5,500 during the same time period. 58 While other factors were at work in the North Carolina furniture industry's distress, this study found that there is a strong connection between the incidence of globalization and the perils of the state's furniture industry markedly manifested in drastic furniture job losses, especially, through unprecedented cost cutting driven offshore outsourcing and devolution of activities, sustained import competition, all of which encouraged capacity underutilization, redundancy, and jobs displacement. As a specific pointer, in the ""globalization sensitive"" period, 1991-2000, the North Carolina furniture industry's employment contracted sharply, losing 2,664 net furniture jobs, compared to 3,163 net furniture jobs gained in the ""globalization neutral"" period, 1980page 28   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  1990. Correspondingly, 47 net furniture establishment plant closings were recorded in the ""globalization sensitive"" period, 1991-2000, as opposed to an increase of 192 plants in the ""globalization neutral"" period, 1980-1990. This trend of losing furniture-manufacturing employment in the State, which was established in the 90s, continues and has accelerated significantly through today. In the third quarter of 2001, North Carolina lost 7,852 furniture-manufacturing jobs59, which represents more than 10 percent of its total employment in this industry. Since 1988, the year when direct furniture manufacturing employment peaked at 90,183 (Figure 5) until August 2002, when we estimate direct furniture manufacturing employment to be no more than 60,000 (4th qtr 2001 furniture employment data, the most recent available, released by the NC ESC was 66,479 and since that time more furniture job losses have been recorded). North Carolina lost more than a third of its employment in furniture. If indirect jobs in the supplying and retailing industries directly dependent on furniture manufacturing are counted in, this amounts to a staggering loss of employment for North Carolina. Consequently, what is needed within the context of the state's general economic revival strategy, is a combination of furniture industry's reengineering leadership that insists on innovation and competitive excellence, job training programs that adequately prepare North Carolinians for the challenges of the New Economy, proactive economic policies that spur growth and raise incomes, and smart trade policies that would nudge the state's traditional industries without inhibiting free entrepreneurship and trade.  V. POLICY ISSUES At a workshop on ""Globalization and North Carolina Industries"" in May 2002, Dr. Edward Fesser of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill asked, ""how ready is North Carolina and its regions for the changes that are accompanying increasingly open markets?"" In an answer, Dr. Fesser declared, ""bottom line North Carolina is not prepared."" Dr. Fesser is not alone. In a recent news story on ""Free Trade,"" the Raleigh, North Carolina, News & Observer, indicated, ""North Carolina's political and business elite awoke belatedly to find remedies to workers' pain, sparked by free trade agreements.""60 These two commentaries unequivocally underscore the severity of globalization-induced problems on the State's economy and the difficult task of addressing them. The reality is that the rules of economic engagement have changed and the terrain has gotten more difficult especially on the heels of free trade. Old-line solutions of yesterday simply cannot work for the new line problems of today. Conventional production and assembly lines have given way to robotics and computers that perform ""miracles"" unimagined not long ago. And with the North Carolina traditional manufacturing industries still threatened and furniture industry job losses escalating, it page 29   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  has become absolutely necessary for both private and public leadership to offer both short term and long-term policy measures to reverse the downward trend and other globalization related travails. North Carolina policy makers must move quickly and aggressively in this direction. Also, North Carolina leaders must be proactive in their approach to help workers and businesses ""fill the skills gap"" and deal with other economic problems wrought by the New Economy. While efforts are being made to reposition the state's traditional industries, however, they are not enough. More needs to be done. Schuler and Buehlmann61 call for a paradigm shift, which is necessary for the industry to regain competitiveness domestically and globally. However, such a shift will take some time and need the support of industry, government, and educational institutions. In the short run, more pragmatic steps, some of which are listed below need to be taken. In the immediate the efforts of the public leadership could be directed at helping the companies in regards to:  Delivering effective corporate and civic leadership that is open to new ideas, friendly to innovation and restructuring, and enthusiastic about ongoing support. Partnering or merging with competitors to reduce costs and other overheads through outsourcing, consolidation, and short-run component supplies. Leveraging better financing including debt management and new credit facilities to help insolvent and bankrupt companies recapitalize and stay in business or to allow them to be bought by competitors. Evaluating business models and product lines with regard to profitability and usefulness. Outsourcing and Supply Chain Management could be used to dramatically lower costs, reduce variability of goods manufactured in-house, and to offer products in niche markets. Lean Manufacturing methods will help companies become more competitive by reducing cost and lead times. Reducing management layers including paperwork and routine clerical time through Internet marketing, automated ordering and billing (EDI), and high speed communication. Diversifying business streams towards optimum allocation of resources and finding untapped niche markets particularly overseas. page 30              NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler    Automating including reengineering of production processes towards a more efficient, flexible, and lower cost but high quality output.  However, the long term survival and growth of the State's furniture industry depends on making wise public policy decisions and supporting the industry through establishing a favorable business climate, providing the appropriate infrastructure, offering help through outreach programs, and helping the industry educate and train a superior workforce. We must acknowledge that furniture manufacturing evolves from a low-skill, mass production industry to a high-tech, high capital industry, which is relying on outsourcing and task specialization at ever increasing speeds. Paradigm shifts, such as the ones advocated by Buehlmann and Schuler62 and models developed by others, which the industry has to embrace and implement will require highly educated individuals and support from facilities at the State's Universities and Community Colleges. Thus, some of the long-term efforts could be directed at: Skill Improvement 1. Education and Job Training  Job skills must be refurbished in line with changing times and industry demands. However, in North Carolina, even in the wake of globalization, ""providing additional schooling for workers who lost their jobs as a result of free trade (globalization) is a shining concept tarnished by reality.""63 Studies64 indicate that North Carolina's job training and education programs for displaced workers are inadequate and ""often miss the target."" In fact, ""it has not worked especially well at being cost effective, improving human capital, or achieving better wages."" For example, coupled with the problems of limited funding and budget cuts, ""four out of five workers who experience free trade related lay-offs don't enroll in a government sponsored retraining program,"" and ""unemployment benefits of many workers are not enough to sustain them while they undergo training."" Also, available training programs are not as flexible as they ought to be and are ""not available in avenues other than community colleges settings,"" further restricting access to would be participants. Moreover, many of the State's educational institutions including community colleges and universities lack the resources to acquire cutting edge machines, equipment, and computers to train workers on the skills they need to succeed in the era of globalization. The result is a skill mismatch whereby students are taught ""New Economy"" skills with ""Old Economy"" machines. The North Carolina Community College System has been at the forefront of providing job training through New and Expanding Industries Program (NEIP) and the Focused industry Training (FIT) programs, especially, for dislocated workers. But this is not enough. North Carolina  page 31   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  needs to invest and do more in training and retraining of workers displaced by globalization related action and the New Economy. Training needs to be extended to incumbent workers as well to make them competitive on their current jobs and, at the same time, increase their chances of better pay and career growth. In addition, the Community College system and Job Link Centers need to develop short-term training and fast track certification programs to accommodate the training needs of those who, although in need of training, do not have large amounts of time for an extended duration of training. Also, for those already dislocated and undergoing training, opportunities must be created to allow them to earn money to supplement their insufficient and terminative unemployment benefits, since many of them are forced to drop out of training programs to find work to ""meet up,"" because their unemployment benefits are exhausted before the completion of their training. Furthermore, there is an urgent need for better coordination of all of the state's job training programs for effective and better results. Currently, existing training programs are ""fragmented and often fail to steer laid-off workers toward growing, well paying industries."" Above all, for the Community Colleges to continue to be the ""state's best available resource"" to respond to job training needs, additional funds must be provided. Closely linked to job training is supporting skills acquisition alliance initiatives. 2. Skills Alliance Network  It is a concept that advocates a regional solution to worker training needs whereby ""companies, labor, and government team up to create training alliances.""65 This concept has grown increasingly popular in recent years among regions on the realization that ""worker training problems cannot be solved at the federal level"" alone, ""solutions needs to be regional, diverse, and industry driven.""66 Also, experience indicates that sometimes federally funded training programs lack flexibility, making it difficult for effective industry and worker participation. A ""major flaw"" of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, for example, is that it provides training funds to displaced and disadvantaged workers only, effectively hindering incumbent workers of needed training.67 A ""highly successful"" example of a skills alliance network is the ""Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership (WRTP)"" created in the 1990s by ""business and labor to bolster family-supporting jobs in a highly competitive manufacturing environment.""68 North Carolina can do the same. The WRTP focuses on four basic areas: 1) ""implementing new technologies and work processes, 2) educating and training the current workforce, 3) meeting the future workforce challenge, and 4) forge partnerships between public, private, non-profit organizations to match the training and employment needs of workers and communities with the labor needs of employers.""69 Furthermore, ""WRTP provides management and labor a forum to share ideas, work together, and to learn best practices.""70 Success at and completion of job training skills programs is tied to availability of sustainable training income.  page 32   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  3. Income  One of the major problems that job training recipients face is lack of money, especially, the inadequacy of unemployment insurance (UI) pay. Predicated on federal and state laws, the unemployment insurance program was created to provide benefits to workers during periods of forced idleness. It pays about half of an individual's average weekly earnings, with a cap of $396 per week for a maximum of 26 weeks. Recently, Congress extended North Carolina's benefits period by 13 weeks to 39 weeks, including making provision for those who qualify for NAFTA/TAA (Trade Adjustment Act) related joblessness to receive benefits for up to 52 weeks. However, the UI program while good, needs reform ""if it is going to remain the first line of defense against hardship and the erosion of assets.""71 Suggested reform measures include: a) urging the North Carolina legislature to make a ""budget provision"" geared towards assisting dislocated workers with income to complete re-training once their UI and NAFTA/TAA benefits are exhausted;"" b) extending the UI benefits duration period from the current 39 weeks, especially, if the recipient is still experiencing difficulty finding work; c) ""maintaining adequate benefits level and streamlining eligibility requirements;"" d) ""increasing minimum wage, promoting livable income, and expanding health care access;"" e) removing the ""waiting week"" period it takes before UI benefits kicks in to ""lessen the burden of unemployment on workers and their families;"" f) upgrading the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA  1993 law that provides leave time to attend to individual and family health conditions including pregnancy for a maximum of 12 weeks) to include compensation for lost wages. Economic Policy 1. Creating New Jobs  Economic changes, whether good or bad, are a fact of life. The bottom line is that jobs must be created for those who are jobless and the winners' circle must be expanded. Struggling communities devastated by plant closings and layoffs must be helped. To buoy the economy, North Carolina leaders must act proactively and work collegially to address serious economic slump problems especially unemployment in the aftermath of globalization. North Carolina must rethink its economic development strategies that worked well in the industrial economy but fall short of the demands of the New Economy (often referred to as the Information-based Economy). Furthermore, stimuli are needed in the areas of business investment incentives, community revitalization, development grants, capacity building, entrepreneurial training, and capital formation. Job creation strategies complement business incentives. 2. Better Targeted Incentives - The William S. Lee Act is a business incentive program created by the North Carolina legislature to give tax breaks to businesses investing in the state, particularly, in poor rural counties. While this is a step in the right direction, available evidence indicates that most (""about 67 percent"") of the tax page 33   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  credits are not benefiting companies located in targeted areas.72 Instead, they go to the more affluent urban counties of the state. The business incentives program ought to be reformed so that more investments and resources are steered to the less prosperous deserving rural counties. As a demonstration, public policy could ""restrict the use of credits"" by ""limiting"" in favor of poor counties the location where incentive credits could be deployed, or, by tightening the ""jobs and investment criteria that businesses in affluent counties have to meet."" Business incentives must be extended to small businesses. 3. Nurturing Small Businesses  According to the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC), a Washington, DC, business advocacy group, ""a big part of the American dream for many people is to start up and grow their own business.""73 Small businesses and entrepreneurships are the lifeblood of U.S. economy. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) reports, ""America's 25 million small businesses employ more than 50 percent of the private workforce, contribute more than half of the nation's gross state product, and are the main source of new jobs in the U.S. economy.""74 Specifically, small businesses represent 99.7 percent of all employers; employ 53 percent of private sector workers; provide 75 percent of net new jobs; account for 47 percent of sales in the nation; produce 55 percent of the innovations; account for 35 percent of federal contract dollars; are responsible for 38 percent of high tech jobs; and represent 96 percent of national exports.75 A recent report by an affiliate of the SBA classified more than 98 percent of North Carolina's employers as small business (those with less than 500 employees), engaging almost half of the private sector workforce. For the state's small businesses to continue to grow and create jobs, North Carolina must not only be perceived as an ""entrepreneur-friendly state,"" public policy must also encourage their survival and viability through such policy instruments as low taxes, regulatory relief, less bureaucracy, access to affordable health care, and improved labor standards. Provision of ""critical infrastructures"" especially in rural counties, is necessary to attract and retain businesses and talented workers. 4. Providing Infrastructure  Infrastructure deficiency or lack of it impedes economic development. For the rural communities to thrive and compete effectively in the New Economy, infrastructure must be provided. While applauding past efforts, many of the state's rural communities still lag behind their urban counterparts in the availability of infrastructure services. Specific areas of concern include water/sewer improvements, competitive natural gas and electricity service rates, affordable Internet access, and better transportation access. Since most of the rural communities ""lack the ability to pay"" to finance needed infrastructure, direct public fiscal intervention is called for including budget provisions, grants and loans, federal dollars and even corporate sponsorships. Besides providing ""Old Economy infrastructure"" we also must provide for the New Economy76 infrastructure.  page 34   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  5. New Economy Infrastructure - According to the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI), a Washington, DC think tank, ""We need to do a better job of training and educating new entrants to the workforce and workers dislocated by economic change. Today, to be competitive, firms are using more technology and reorganizing production processes in new ways, such as cellular production, use of teams, and other high performance work organization methods that require higher levels and new kinds of skills.""77 The PPI is not alone. Professor Lester Thurow from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) correctly stated: ""Skilled people are required to discover new knowledge, invent new ideas and processes, staff the vital production processes, ensure proper upkeep of intricate equipments, use and apply new products and processes induced by technology advances.""78 Simply put, to engender innovation and equip her citizens to win in the New Economy, North Carolina must invest in the knowledge infrastructure of the 21st century. It seems that North Carolina is lagging behind and has a lot of catching up to do. Dr. Edward Feser of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has argued, ""in North Carolina, we are specialized in low-tech, low-wage traditional commodity chains...we are highly specialized in declining, traditional manufacturing industries...the message of innovation, learning is not reaching significant segments of our population.""79 This must change if North Carolina is to be a serious player in the new global economy. In the industrial economy, investment in ""commonly shared resources"" including roads, bridges, rails, airports, seaports, water and electricity supplies was the order of the day. While these facilities are still indispensable, however, ""now for the most part they benefit localities in which they are located and, are likely to do less for national productivity.""80 In the information driven global economy that we are in, investments in new kinds of infrastructure, especially information technology, is the key to success because its power, effect, and reach is overwhelming, and transcends national boundaries instantaneously. North Carolina must rise to the challenge of this irreversible trend. Research indicates that higher productivity will come mainly from advances in and application of knowledge, especially application of advanced information technologies.81 Acquisition of technology is not enough in itself to spur productivity and growth, but the ability of workers to develop and use these technologies is what makes the difference. Equally vital is to foster ""digital opportunity,"" particularly in the underserved North Carolina communities through Internet access and high-speed communications technologies. Consequently, in the New Economy, North Carolina must continue to strive to improve her technology capabilities including support for higher education technology skills, increasing research and development funding, offering incentives such as matching grants and tax credits to companies to train workers, as well as bolstering lifelong learning to keep up with the rapid changes and demands of the Information Age.  page 35   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  Trade Policy North Carolina has no choice but to share in the benefits as well as in the banes of globalization. North Carolina leaders can work to influence the reduction of the undesirable impacts of globalization on its businesses and people by leveraging the following trade policy options: 1. Advocacy - The message of the benefits of globalization vis--vis free trade must always be reinforced and made unambiguously clear to North Carolinians. At an economic summit in Davos, Switzerland during his tenure, President Clinton said, ""open markets and rules based trade are the best engine we know of to lift living standards, reduce environmental destruction and build shared prosperity.""82 Today's information and transportation technologies further enhance the benefits of the principle of division of labor83 where outsourcing84 represents a further degree of specialization of the principle introduced in the seventeenth century and the benefits of the comparative advantage among nations85. North Carolina is no exception. Consequently, North Carolina leaders must never tire of advocating for the expansion of free trade, insisting on the facts that globalization is good for North Carolina. Trade expansion, for example, provides more markets for the goods and services that North Carolina companies produce. Also, it improves living standards and ensures the well being of working families, fosters shared prosperity, encourages competition, boosts commerce, enhances exports, and protects the environment.86 In addition, trade expansion swells public revenues through trade taxes and other charges that could be used to provide needed public services. Moreover, openness to trade not only gives consumers more choices, it also ""provides access to new ideas, technologies, and methods of production, spurring innovation and development.""87 Leadership advocacy extends to legislative influence. 2. Legislative Influence  The U.S. Congress may not have the final say on international Trade Agreements, but it can influence and shape its outcome especially during the negotiations deliberation process. North Carolina's Congressional Delegation must never retreat from working with their colleagues and consulting with other counterparts to get the best trade deals for the nation and, by extension, North Carolina. Also, they must always work to provide funding and, press for better enforcement of trade laws especially ""anti-dumpingf"" and anti-transshipmentg"" rules, to adequately check trade practices inimical to the national interests including North Carolina's economic interests.  Dumping is the practice of selling products overseas below home market prices, or below the cost of shipping and production, ostensibly, to stifle competition. g Transshipping is the practice of evading quotas or avoiding tariffs by shipping through a third party country.  f  page 36   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  Another way Congress could influence trade policy is to provide the President with ""fast track"" negotiating authorityh. The case must be made that without ""fast track,"" ""U.S. will be left as observers, losing her opportunity to shape globalization, content to be simply shaped by it.""88 Also, those ""hurt by freer trade"" need help. ""Broadening"" the assistance eligibility could assist this group, helping dislocated workers with ""health insurance tax credit,"" and ""wage insurance"" benefits to compensate for reduced pay in their new jobs. Trade policy discussion would be incomplete without mention of the World Trade Organization (WTO). 3. World Trade Organization Reform  The WTO was organized in 1995 and is located in Geneva, Switzerland. It is an international organization dealing with rules of trade between nations.89 It has 144 member nations as of January 1, 2002. While WTO cannot dictate national policy, it is a rule-based international trading system with some restrictive clauses and principles, which the public can find overbearing, if not totally unacceptable at times. As such, it is ""not enough for national trade bureaucrats"" to have ""confidence"" in the WTO, citizens and corporate entities must also be encouraged to do the same to allay perceived misgivings. As such, it is important to make reforms that would make WTO activities more open and transparent with due regard to protection of national security and ""proprietary information."" Also, WTO must strive to bring a balance in the conflict between free trade advocates, who contend that trade control impairs the market, and environmentalists, who argue that unrestricted commerce will foster a ""race to the bottom"" among poor nations with few or no environmental hurdles as they seek to attract foreign investments. This could be achieved through broad stakeholders' consultations in the formulation of trade policies, information sharing, building links between and WTO and civil society, making the WTO more inclusive by giving poor nations more say in the affairs of WTO, preferring dialogue and negotiated settlement over trade sanctions, etc. Furthermore, the WTO must look into labor standard concerns especially reported abuses in factories and workhouses around the world that tend to obviate the sentiment that ""development has benefited wealthy multinational companies at the expense of ordinary workers."" While all labor abuse problems cannot be solved in one fell swoop, some steps can be taken to improve labor conditions, including, promoting corporate social responsibility, better enforcement of labor codes, rewarding companies that meet labor criteria, and improved information access.  Fast track allows the ""President to strike trade deals, which Congress will then vote for or against, but may not amend.""  h  page 37   NC Furniture Industry and Globalization  Nwagbara, Buehlmann and Schuler  VI: FURNITURE INDUSTRY RESOURCES Public and private agencies that can assist North Carolina furniture manufacturers find new markets abroad, answer regulatory and compliance questions, and provide technical and market consulting.

A shrinking budget deficit, low interest rates, a stable macroeconomic environment, expanding international trade with fewer barriers, and effective private sector management are all credited with playing a role in this healthy economic performance. Many observers believe advances in information technology (IT), driven by the growth of the Internet,*1 have also contributed to creating this healthier-than-expected economy. In recent testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan noted, ""...our nation has been experiencing a higher growth rate of productivity--output per hour--worked in recent years. The dramatic improvements in computing power and communication and information technology appear to have been a major force behind this beneficial trend.""1 Some have even suggested that these advances will create a ""long boom""2 which will take the economy to new heights over the next quarter century. Other economists remain skeptical about the contribution of the IT industry to overall productivity. As yet, there is limited direct evidence in government data that investments in IT have substantially raised productivity in many non-IT industries.3 While the full economic impact of information impact is significant. IT industries have been economy-- a trend that is likely to continue. all business equipment investment. Declining inflation. technology cannot yet be precisely evaluated, its growing at more than double the rate of the overall Investments in IT now represent over 45 percent of prices for IT products have lowered overall  This report also begins a discussion about the potential impact on the economy of the Internet and electronic commerce. Recent rapid growth of the Internet is in part attributable to its strength as a medium of communication, education and entertainment, and, more recently, as a tool for electronic commerce.  * The Internet is a global matrix of interconnected computer networks using the Internet Protocol (IP) to communicate with each other. For simplicity, the term ""Internet"" is used throughout this paper to encompass all such data networks and hundreds of applications such as the World Wide Web and e-mail that run on those networks, even though some electronic commerce activities may take place on proprietary or other networks that are not technically part of the Internet. 1   Businesses in virtually every sector of the economy are beginning to use the Internet to cut the cost of purchasing, manage supplier relationships, streamline logistics and inventory, plan production, and reach new and existing customers more effectively. Cost savings, increased consumer choice and improved consumer convenience are driving growth in the sale of physical goods and in the digital delivery of goods and services via the Internet. Because the Internet is new and its uses are developing very rapidly, reliable economy-wide statistics are hard to find. Further research is needed. This report therefore uses industry and company examples to illustrate the rapid pace at which Internet commerce is being deployed and the benefits being realized. Examples showing the growth of the Internet and electronic commerce this past year are numerous:  Fewer than 40 million people around the world were connected to the Internet during 1996. By the end of 1997, more than 100 million people were using the Internet.4 As of December 1996, about 627,000 Internet domain names had been registered. By the end of 1997, the number of domain names more than doubled to reach 1.5 million.5 Traffic on the Internet has been doubling every 100 days.6 Cisco Systems closed 1996 having booked just over $100 million in sales on the Internet. By the end of 1997, its Internet sales were running at a $3.2 billion annual rate. In 1996, Amazon.com, the first Internet bookstore, recorded sales of less than $16 million. In 1997, it sold $148 million worth of books to Internet customers. One of the nation's largest book retailers, Barnes and Noble, launched its own online bookstore in 1997 to compete with Amazon for this rapidly growing online market. In January 1997, Dell Computers was selling less than $1 million of computers per day on the Internet. The company reported reaching daily sales of $6 million several times during the December 1997 holiday period. Auto-by-Tel, a Web-based automotive marketplace, processed a total of 345,000 purchase requests for autos through its Web site in 1996, for $1.8 billion in auto sales. As of the end of November 1997, the Web site was generating $500 million a month in auto sales ($6 billion annualized) and processed over 100,000 purchase requests each month.             If the trends suggested by this preliminary analysis continue, IT and electronic commerce can be expected to drive economic growth for many years to come. To realize this potential, however, the private sector and governments must work together to create a predictable, market-driven legal framework to facilitate electronic commerce; to create non-bureaucratic means that ensure that the Internet is a safe environment; and to create human resource policies that endow students and workers with the skills necessary for jobs in the new digital economy. 2   CHAPTER ONE: THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION  The Industrial Revolution was powered by the steam engine, invented in 1712,7 and electricity, first harnessed in 1831.8 Harnessing the power of steam meant less labor was needed for manual work; it also meant that factories could locate anywhere, not just in geographical areas with strong wind and water resources. Because it required a network to contain and transmit its power, electricity's potential had to wait until 50 years after it was first harnessed before the first power station was built in 1882.9 It took another 50 years before electricity powered 80 percent of factories and households across the country (Figure 1).10  Figure 1.

It was not until factories replaced Source: David, Paul. ""The Dynamo and the Computer: An Historical Perspective on the Modern Productivity Paradox."" the old power system for electric motors that fundamental changes in production occurred. Factory structures were streamlined, and key processes, such as materials handling and manufacturing flows, were made more efficient.11 The digital revolution is happening much more quickly. The harnessing of light for nearly instantaneous communications and the ability to use microscopic circuits to process and store huge amounts of information are enabling this current economic transformation. In 1946, the world's first programmable computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), stood 10 feet tall, stretched 150 feet wide, cost millions of dollars, and could execute up to 5,000 operations per second. Twenty-five years later, in 1971, Intel packed 12 times ENIAC's processing power into a 12 mm2 chip with a $200 price tag.12 Today's personal computers (PCs) with Pentium processors perform in excess of 400 million instructions per second (MIPS). At the current pace of development, by 2012, PCs will be able to handle 100,000 million instructions per second.13 3   As late as 1980, phone conversations only traveled over copper wires which carried less than one page of information per second. Today, a strand of optical fiber as thin as a human hair can transmit in a single second the equivalent of over 90,000 volumes of an encyclopedia.14 By 2002, a constellation of several hundred satellites orbiting hundreds of miles above the earth is expected to bring high-bandwidth15 communications to businesses, schools and individuals everywhere on the planet. A global digital network using new packet switching technology16 combines the power of these remarkable innovations in computing and communication. The Internet ties together the computing power on desks, in factories and in offices around the world through a high-speed communications infrastructure. More than 100 million people around the world, most of whom had never heard of the Internet four years ago, now use it to do research, send e-mail to friends, make requests for bids to suppliers, and shop for cars or books. The Internet's pace of adoption eclipses all other technologies that preceded it. Radio was in existence 38 years before 50 million people tuned in; TV took 13 years to reach that benchmark. Sixteen years after the first PC kit came out, 50 million people were using one.17 Once it was opened to the general public, the Internet crossed that line in four years.18 Growing Economic Importance of the IT Sector: One of the most notable economic developments in recent years has been the rapid increase Figure 2. IT's Share of the Economy Grows in the IT sector's (computing and communications) share of 9 investment activity and of the 8.2 8 gross domestic product (GDP). 7 It grew from 4.9 percent of the 6.4 6.1 6 economy in 1985 to 6.1 percent 4.9 5 4.5 by 1990 as the PC began to 4.2 4 penetrate homes and offices. The 3 next spurt started in 1993, with 2 the burst of commercial activity 1 driven by the Internet. From 0 1993 to 1998, the IT share of the 1977 1980 1985 1990 1993 1998 economy will have risen from 6.4 Source: U.S. Department of Commerce Economics and Statistics Administration percent to an estimated 8.2 Estimates based on Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census data percent (Figure 2). With such rapid expansion, IT's share of total nominal GDP growth has been running almost double its share of the economy, at close to 15 percent. % of GDP  4   What makes this rise in IT's nominal share of the economy even more remarkable is the fact that IT prices, adjusted for quality and performance improvements, have been falling while prices in the rest of the economy have been rising. Computing power has been doubling every 18 months for the past 30 years. At the same time, the average price of a transistor has fallen by six orders of magnitude, due to microprocessor development. In just six years' time, the cost of microprocessor computing power has decreased from $230 to $3.42 per MIPS (Figure 3). No other manufactured item has decreased in cost so far, so fast.19  Figure 3. Microprocessor Prices Plummet from $230 per MIPS to $3.42 per MIPS in 6 years 250 230  200 $ per MIPS  150  100  50  50 16 3.42  0 1991 1994  1995  1997  Source: Intel  Year-to-Year Price Change* (%)  In 1996 and 1997, declining prices in IT industries lowered overall inflation by one full percentage point (Figure 4). Without the contribution of the IT sector, overall inflation, at 2.0 percent, would have been 3.1 percent in 1997.  Figure 4.

In recent years, IT industries have been responsible for more than one-quarter of real economic growth (Figure 5).20 % of Real Economic Growth  Figure 5.

In the 1960s, business spending on IT equipment represented only 3 percent of total business equipment investment. In 1996, IT's share rose to 45 percent (Figure 6). For some industries like communications, insurance and investment brokerages, IT equipment constitutes over threequarters of all equipment investment. Information technology supports high-paying jobs. In 1996, 7.4 million people worked in IT industries and in IT-related occupations across the economy. They earned close to $46,000 per year, compared to an average of $28,000 for the private sector. The impact of IT is also reflected in the capital IT firms currently represent. The collective market capitalizations of five major companies, Microsoft, Intel, Compaq, Dell and Cisco, has grown to over $588 billion in 1997 from under $12 billion in 1987,21 close to a fifty-fold increase in the space of a decade.

Growth could accelerate in the coming years not only in the IT sector itself, but across all sectors of the economy as the number of people connected to the Internet multiplies and as its commercial use grows. The growth will be driven by four types of economic activity:  Building out the Internet: In 1994, three million people, most of them in the United States, used the Internet.22 In 1998, 100 million people around the world use the Internet.23 Some experts believe that one billion people may be connected to the Internet by 2005.24 This expansion is driving dramatic increases in computer, software, services and communications investments. Electronic commerce among businesses: Businesses began using the Internet for commercial transactions with their business partners about two years ago. Early users already report significant productivity improvements from using electronic networks to create, buy, distribute, sell, and service products and services. By 2002, the Internet may be used for more than $300 billion worth of commerce between businesses.25 Digital delivery of goods and services: Software programs, newspapers, and music CDs no longer need to be packaged and delivered to stores, homes or news kiosks. They can be delivered electronically over the Internet. Airline tickets and securities transactions over the Internet already occur in large numbers. Other industries such as consulting services, entertainment, banking and insurance, education and health care face some hurdles but are also beginning to use the Internet to change the way they do business. Over time, the sale and transmission of goods and services electronically is likely to be the largest and most visible driver of the new digital economy. Retail sale of tangible goods: The Internet can also be used to order tangible goods and services that are produced, stored and physically delivered. Though Internet sales are less than 1 percent of total retail sales today, sales of certain products such as computers, software, cars, books and flowers are growing rapidly.        7   CHAPTER TWO: BUILDING OUT THE INTERNET  Where advances in telecommunications and computing largely occurred side-by-side in the past, today, they converge in the Internet. Soon, virtually all information technology investment will be part of interlinked communications systems, whether internal to a business, between businesses, between individuals and businesses, or individual to individual. However measured, the Internet is expanding at a very rapid pace. For instance, the number of Americans using the Internet has grown from fewer than 5 million in 1993 to as many as 62 million by 1997.26 UUNET, one of the largest Internet backbone providers, estimates that Internet traffic doubles every 100 days.27 The number of names registered in the domain name system grew from 26,000 in July 1993 to 1.3 million in four years. Over the same period, the number of hosts connected to the Internet expanded from under 1.8 million to over 19.5 million (Table 1). Table 1. Growth of Internet Hosts and Domain Names* (000s) # Hosts July 93 July 94 July 95 July 96 July 97 1,776 3,212 6,642 12,881 19,540 # Domains 26 46 120 488 1,301  * Internet host refers to a computer that is connected to the Internet that has a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address. A domain name represents a record within the Domain Name System. Source: Network Wizards http://www.nw.com  In January 1995, just over 27,000 top-level commercial (.com) domain names were assigned. Most businesses used them for little more than posting product and company descriptions, store locations, annual reports and information about how to contact corporate headquarters. Two and a half years later, commercial domain names number 764,000.28 Static brochures and bulletin boards are giving way to full-fledged businesses offering financial services, news and information, manufactured goods, and travel and entertainment to individuals and businesses. To meet this increased demand, consumer electronics companies, media giants, phone companies, computer companies, software firms, satellite builders, cell phone businesses, Internet service providers, television cable companies and, in a few cases, electric utilities, are aggressively investing to build out the Internet.  8   Hundreds of new firms are starting up around the country to help businesses use the World Wide Web effectively. They design Web sites and advertising banners, create Web-based catalogs, build security tools, create and track direct marketing campaigns, provide consulting services, and develop technology to speed the flow of data and information across the network. Venture capitalists gave just under $12 billion to hundreds of information technology start-ups in 1996 and 1997.29  Making the Internet Faster and More Accessible Households typically connect to the Internet through a PC and a telephone line. This method of access means that most households without PCs (just under 60 percent of all U.S. households30) do not have Internet access. It also means that most Internet connections from the home are slow.31 To illustrate the importance of speed, it takes 46 minutes to download a 3.5-minute video using a 28.8 kbps (thousand bits per second) modem, the modem most commonly used by households today (Table 2). Table 2. Time to Download 3.5-Minute Video Clip Using Different Technologies Transfer Time 28.8 Kbps modem 128 Kbps ISDN 4 Mbps cable modem 8 Mbps ADSL 10 Mbps cable modem 46 minutes 10 minutes 20 seconds 10 seconds 8 seconds  Telephone companies, satellite companies, cable service providers and others are Source: FCC, CS Docket No. 96-496, 1997; ADSL from Werbach working to create faster Internet 1997, p. 75. connections and expand the means by which users can access the Internet. New technologies such as ADSL (Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line) enable copper telephone lines to send data at speeds up to 8 million bits per second (mbps). At this speed, that same 3.5 minute video takes 10 seconds to download.32 PC manufacturers and software developers are also taking steps to make home computers cheaper and easier to use.33 Some PCs can now be purchased for less than $1,000 apiece. New network computers are expected to be introduced at prices of a few hundred dollars apiece. At the same time, new and enhanced software programs (for instance, better graphical user interfaces, search tools, and voice recognition technology) will make the PC and the Internet easier to use and thereby able to reach a broader community of consumers. Soon, many Americans will be using their televisions to access the Internet. Present in nearly every household, TVs are easy to operate and require little or no maintenance. Digital broadcasting services (high-definition television, or HDTV) will be available in the top ten markets by November 1999, and broadcasters are expected to make the transition to digital 9   broadcasting by 2006.34 With digital broadcasting, TV viewers will be able to interact with their televisions and surf the Web, pay bills, plan a weekend trip, or make dinner reservations. Already, satellite dishes and signals carried over cable television lines enable consumers to receive data from the Internet through their TVs and television programming through their personal computers. At speeds of 10 million bits per second, a household connected to the Internet via a cable modem can download a 3.5-minute video in 8 seconds.35 In most cases today, however, the outgoing communication (the speed at which the Internet receives the commands by the user) is still limited to the fastest modem speeds that copper telephone wires will support. Two-way cable traffic would be much faster, but only 9 percent of the 103 million cable subscribers in the U.S. and Canada (9 million homes) live in zones where two-way cable connectivity exists. And, only a small number of them--111,000--have actually subscribed to the service. By 2000, analysts estimate that two-way cable connectivity will be available to 34 million households, of which 1.6 million are expected to subscribe to the service.36 Cable operators are planning to make significant investments in the next few years to upgrade their systems to carry two-way Internet traffic. The wait for broadband Internet access to households is measured in years, not decades. Within the next five to ten years, the vast majority of Americans should be able to interact with the Internet from their television sets, watch television on their PCs, and make telephone calls from both devices. These combined services will be brought to homes by satellite, wireless, microwave, television cable and telephone lines, all interconnected in one overall system. People will also access the Internet away from their homes or offices. Cellular telephones and portable digital assistants (PDAs) have become very sophisticated devices capable of sending faxes, receiving e-mail and electronic pages, and now, accessing the Internet. Industry experts predict that users of cellular phones and digital personal communications devices will more than triple from 77 million to 251 million by 1999.37 Technology already exists to enable many appliances and consumer electronics devices to transmit and receive data. The first products to link home appliances with PCs should become available this year. Entering a simple message into a computer on a desk will be able to turn off the television or pre-heat the oven for dinner. Automobiles with video monitors will receive data from overhead satellites to warn about traffic jams, give directions to the nearest gas station, and deliver the latest news and information. The U.S. Government's FY 1999 budget calls for $850 million to be invested in high-performance computing and communications. As part of this effort, the budget provides $110 million for the Next Generation Internet Initiative, which will create a research network that is 100 to 1,000 times faster than today's Internet, and invests in R&D for smarter, faster networks that support new applications, such as telemedicine, distance learning and real-time collaboration.  10   Table 3. The Race to Build Out the Communications Infrastructure of the Internet During the 19th and 20th centuries, governments played a key role in helping build or actively regulate much of the country's transportation, communication and energy infrastructure powering the Industrial Revolution. Although the Internet originated in U.S. Defense Department research, private sector investments will largely drive its future expansion. Telecommunications: Manufacturers and software companies have been developing new technologies to allow higher-bandwidth communications across the existing copper network infrastructure, including DSL technologies, compression and faster electronic switches. Communications carriers around the world are building out fiber optic networks; technological advancements including optical amplification and new photonic switches make these high-speed networks more powerful and more efficient. Satellite: Satellite, telecommunications, electronics and aerospace companies plan to spend close to $27 billion to build out a global broadband network in the sky between 1998-2002 to reach most of the two billion people that live in areas around the world where phone service is unavailable. Cable: Thick cable wires pass more than 90 percent of U.S. households, piping in TV programming at speeds much faster than telephone copper carries voice traffic. Four years ago, many cable companies began to prepare the cable network for two-way Internet traffic, investing in fiber optic cable and set-top boxes to decipher voice, video and data sent in digital form. Wireless: Over time, wireless networks will be integrated with the Internet. Investments in satellites and repeater stations are now being made at a rapid rate to accomplish this. Cellular phones, pagers and hand-held computers will be able to transmit and receive voice, data and Internet traffic. Electric utilities: A number of utility companies around the country are beginning to lay thousands of miles of new fiber cable for Internet access at speeds ten times faster than today's high-speed phone connections.  As the number of Internet users grows, accessing the Internet becomes faster and easier to do, and as the number of Internet-enabled devices multiplies, the IT industry's share of the economy can be expected to continue to expand rapidly.  11   CHAPTER THREE: ELECTRONIC COMMERCE BETWEEN BUSINESSES  Internet commerce is growing fastest among businesses. It is used for coordination between the purchasing operations of a company and its suppliers; the logistics planners in a company and the transportation companies that warehouse and move its products; the sales organizations and the wholesalers or retailers that sell its products; and the customer service and maintenance operations and the company's final customers. Early computers were used for scientific and military purposes, not for commerce. They first made their way into commercial applications in the 1960s, with ERMA (the Electronic Recording Machine--Accounting). Banks were swamped with the growing volume of checks that needed to be processed (between 1943 and 1952, check use had doubled from 4 billion to 8 billion checks written each year). By automating the function with ERMA, the first bank to use the computer, Bank of America, reported that nine employees could do the job that previously took 50 people.38 The commercial use of computers quickly spread as companies in a variety of industries used them to keep accounting ledgers, administer payroll, create management reports, and schedule production. In the 1970s and 1980s, businesses extended their computing power beyond the company's walls, sending and receiving purchase orders, invoices and shipping notifications electronically via EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). EDI is a standard for compiling and transmitting information between computers, often over private communications networks called value-added networks (VANs). The 1980s also brought the introduction of computer-aided design (CAD), computeraided engineering (CAE) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems that enabled engineers, designers and technicians to access and work on design specifications, engineering drawings and technical documentation via internal corporate communications networks. The cost of installation and maintenance of VANs put electronic communication out of the reach of many small and medium-sized businesses. For the most part, these businesses relied on the fax and telephone for their business communications. Even larger companies that used EDI often did not realize the full potential savings because many of their business partners did not use it. The Internet makes electronic commerce affordable to even the smallest home office. Companies of all sizes can now communicate with each other electronically, through the public Internet, networks for company-use only (intranets) or for use by a company and its business partners (extranets), and private value-added networks. Companies are quickly moving to utilize the expanded opportunities created by the Internet. For instance, Cisco Systems, Dell Computers and Boeing's spare parts business report almost 12   immediate benefits after putting their ordering and customer service operations on the Internet. They are so convinced of its benefit to their own companies and their customers that they believe most of their business will involve the Internet in the next three to five years.39 Although still in an embryonic stage, analysts predict businesses will trade as much as $300 billion annually over the Internet in the next five years.40 Some believe the volume of Internet commerce will be much higher. As statistically valid sampling data are not yet available, determining the actual growth rate is very difficult to do. This report does not attempt to size the current market or predict the size of the future market. Instead, it describes the underlying drivers of growth of business-to-business electronic commerce, using specific company and industry examples as illustrations. Growth of business-to-business electronic commerce is being driven by lower purchasing costs, reductions in inventories, lower cycle times, more efficient and effective customer service, lower sales and marketing costs and new sales opportunities.  LOWER PURCHASING COSTS Buying materials or services for a corporation can be a complex, multi-step process. First, purchasers have to find suppliers who make the product and determine whether they meet volume, delivery, quality and price requirements. Once a potential supplier has been chosen, detailed drawings and information are transmitted to the supplier so that the product is built to exact customer specifications. Assuming the product sample has been approved and the supplier's manufacturing lines are ready for production, the buyer then transmits a purchase order (P.O.) for a specific quantity of goods. The buyer, meanwhile, receives notification from the supplier that the P.O. was received and confirmation that the order can be met. When the product ships from the supplier, the buyer again receives notification, along with an invoice for goods delivered. The buyer's accounting department matches the invoice with the P.O. and pays the invoice. When changes to the normal order happen--a frequent occurrence in most companies--the process can be much more complicated. Companies lower procurement costs by consolidating purchases and developing relationships with key suppliers to benefit from volume discounts and tighter integration in the manufacturing process. They also cast a wide net for lower-cost sources of supply. Large companies have been using EDI over private networks to reduce labor, printing and mailing costs in the procurement process. Automating routine procurement means the procurement staff has more time to focus on negotiating better prices and building supplier relationships. Analysts estimate that businesses already trade well over $150 billion in goods and services using EDI over VANs.41 Companies using EDI commonly save 5-10 percent in procurement costs.42 The Internet has the potential to further reduce procurement costs. Large companies benefit from lower transmission costs versus private networks. The Internet also opens the door to doing 13   business electronically with new suppliers and with small and medium-sized suppliers who formerly communicated only via fax or phone. Small companies also benefit. The Internet reduces processing costs and opens up new sales opportunities from potential buyers that post requests for bids on the Internet. Procurement via the Internet is new enough that projecting economy-wide savings or other benefits is difficult. Specific company examples suggest that its potential is large and growing. For instance, General Electric's lighting division reports significant gains in responsiveness, improved service, and reduced labor and material costs as a result of shifting purchasing from a largely manual system to an electronic one using Internet protocols. Factories at General Electric's lighting division used to send hundreds of requisitions for quotes (RFQs) to the corporate sourcing department each day for low-value machine parts. For each requisition, the accompanying blueprints had to be requested from storage, retrieved from the vault, transported on site, photocopied, folded, attached to paper requisition forms with quote sheets, stuffed into envelopes and mailed out. The process took at least seven days and was so complex and time-intensive that the sourcing department normally only sent out bid packages to two to three suppliers at a time. In 1996, GE Lighting piloted the company's first online procurement system, TPN Post, an extranet developed by GE Information Services. Now, the sourcing department receives the requisitions electronically from its internal customers and can send off a bid package to suppliers around the world via the Internet. The system automatically pulls the correct drawings and attaches them to the electronic requisition forms. Within two hours from the time the sourcing department starts the process, suppliers are notified of incoming RFQs by e-mail, fax or EDI. A bid can be evaluated and awarded the same day GE receives it. Previously, more than one them with purchase orders beginning to end, invoices modifications that happen out of four invoices had to be investigated and ""reworked"" to reconcile and receipts. With the transaction handled electronically from are now automatically reconciled with purchase orders, reflecting any along the way.  According to GE, the division's labor costs for procurement have declined by 30 percent. Sixty percent of the procurement staff have been redeployed. The sourcing department has at least six to eight additional days a month to concentrate on strategic activities rather than the paperwork, photocopying and envelope stuffing it had to do when the process was manual. Material costs have declined by up to 20 percent as the ability to reach a wider base of suppliers online created more competition and led to lower prices. As of October 1997, eight divisions of General Electric use TPN for some of their procurement. The company bought more than $1 billion worth of goods and supplies via the Internet in 1997. By 2000, GE aims to have all 12 of its business units purchasing its non-production and maintenance, repair and operations materials (MRO) via the Internet, for a total of $5 billion. GE 14   estimates that streamlining these purchases alone could save the company $500-$700 million over the next three years.43 Other companies report plans to use the Internet for procurement. One out of four purchasing managers expects to use the Internet for MRO purchases, up from 10 percent who use it for that purpose today.44  REDUCED INVENTORY/THE RIGHT PRODUCTS IN STOCK The longer it takes for production schedules to reach suppliers, the more inventory a company has to hold to account for delays and errors, and the less quickly it can react to changes in demand. The more inventory a company holds, the higher its operating costs, and the lower its profits. Carrying more inventory does not ensure better customer service, either. Shelves weighed down with size-10 running shoes do not help the customer who wears a size 8. When a customer enters a furniture showroom looking for an armchair with green and white stripes and is told it's on back-order for 12 weeks, he may drive across town to a competitor rather than wait. Managing inventory properly results in better service for the customer and lower operating costs for the company. Increasing the frequency of inventory ""turns"" (the number of times inventory in existing warehouse or store space is sold or used for production each year) reduces inventoryrelated interest, handling and storage costs. Reducing inventory levels also means that existing manufacturing capacity is more efficiently utilized. More efficient production can reduce or eliminate the need for additional investments in plant and equipment. IBM's Personal Systems Group provides an illustration of how the Internet and private networks are helping companies keep stocks of inventory smaller, yet more targeted on likely consumer needs. Each month, the group's marketing departments report information on how many PCs they think will be sold. The production planning departments identify manufacturing and materials capacity in each factory. Armed with inputs from across the company on demand and supply, production schedules are assigned to each factory. The procurement staff uses the same information to negotiate with suppliers. As new information comes in each week, the process is repeated and the production schedule fine-tuned. Electronic communication between factories, marketing and purchasing departments have made this quick response possible. Problems are communicated as they arise and the appropriate adjustments are made. If demand suddenly rises or if one factory cannot meet its production schedule, IBM is aware of it in time to increase production at another factory. The Personal Systems Group has been phasing in this Advanced Planning System (APS) since 1996 and already reports significant results. During the first year of APS, inventory turns 15   increased 40 percent over the previous year, and sales volumes increased by 30 percent. The group anticipates another 50 percent increase in turns and a 20 percent increase in sales volume in 1997. By better utilizing its existing manufacturing capacity, IBM has avoided having to make additional investments to meet the increased volume requirements. The lower investment and operating costs due to improved inventory turns have resulted in savings of $500 million. IBM is not alone in its efforts to use networks to improve communication between the marketing and sales arm of a business and its production units. Manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers are working together to form standards and guidelines for better forecasting and restocking called Collaborative Planning Forecasting Replenishment (CPFR). These standards will allow companies to collaborate in determining future demand for products and to share information about the availability of products in stock. With CPFR, a retailer and its supplier electronically post their latest sets of forecasts for a list of products. A server tied to the Internet compares the forecasts and flags differences in those that exceed a normal safety margin--say 5 percent. Differences are then reconciled by planners at both the retailer and the supplier. To keep that process from becoming too cumbersome, software companies are working to develop programs that automatically handle exception messages based on rules that apply to that business.45 The accounting and consulting firm Ernst & Young believes that CPFR could yield an inventory reduction of $250 billion to $350 billion across the economy. By reducing inventory levels, businesses will realize substantial savings in materials handling, warehousing, and general administrative costs.46  LOWER CYCLE TIMES Cycle time is the total time it takes to build a product. There are certain fixed costs associated with building any product that do not vary with the amount of production, but rather are time dependent. These ""fixed"" costs include depreciation of equipment, most utility and building costs, and most managerial and supervisory time. If the time to build a product can be reduced to seven days instead of ten, then the fixed costs per product are lower since less time was needed. Electronic commerce allows ""cycle times"" to be shortened, allowing more to be produced for the same or lower costs. In the 1980s, the lower cycles times realized by Japanese companies presented American companies with a serious competitive challenge. They responded by breaking down organizational barriers that had grown up between design, manufacturing and sales divisions and improving communications with external partners. Establishing electronic links with their large suppliers and customers enabled companies to transmit and receive purchase orders, invoices and shipping notifications with much shorter lead times than previously. Some also began to share product specifications and drawings over valueadded networks to speed product design and development.  16   The Internet will permit even further reductions by broadening the network of businesses connected electronically and by facilitating collaboration on projects across work teams and geographical locations. Few industries faced a greater challenge to reduce cycle times than the automotive industry in the early 1980s. While Japanese automakers could take a car from concept to mass production in approximately three years, American companies typically took four to six years. First, a full-scale clay model was built to see how the vehicle would look in real life. Incorporating changes to the model could take months. Once approved, single- or multipleprototype vehicles were built by hand to see whether parts fit together correctly and whether the car could be built economically. Engineers worked with the prototype builders to refine the engineering specifications. Once the prototype was ready, the engineers would design the individual components and the tooling needed to make the components. Then, purchasing agents would work with suppliers to produce prototype tooling and parts for assembly of pilot or preproduction vehicles. If everything went smoothly, the manufacturing-engineering team would then assemble the vehicle to discover any assembly problems. Finally, after additional modifications, the vehicle was mass produced.47 Today, all parties involved in designing a new platform or vehicle--designers, engineers, suppliers, and manufacturing and assembly personnel--work as part of a team, contributing to the process from beginning to end. As a result of computerization, steps that used to take weeks or months can now be done in a matter of days. Sharing information electronically allows the different members of the group to work on projects together, rather than having to wait for each member to finish his step before the next one can be taken. Through the use of computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and computer-aided engineering (CAE), the whole team can share computer files and use 3-D modeling techniques to design the vehicle and see how parts fit without building prototypes by hand. Changes to the components can be made without building sample tooling and parts. When the final design is agreed on, CAM data is loaded into machines that build the tooling and prototype parts. The same techniques are being used to reconfigure and retool assembly plants. Working as a team and sharing information electronically has cut the time it takes to develop and build a new vehicle to about 30 months.48 Automotive companies now want to shorten the design cycle to less than 24 months by setting up platform teams in different parts of the world and linking them electronically. By using global communication links, engineers in Detroit can assign a problem to engineers on their team in India. With the time zone difference, the engineers in the Far East can work on the problem and get an answer back to their Detroit counterparts by the next business day.49 Cycle times are also being shortened for production. Before the use of EDI, automotive companies communicated production requirements and schedules to their suppliers by phone, fax or mail. This meant time-consuming manual data entry, photocopying and information hand-offs 17   from one supplier to another. It could take several weeks to get the manufacturing schedule and requirements to all component factories and vendors. To minimize the impact of delays and errors caused by miscommunication, the assembly plant kept a large inventory of parts on-hand. Today, automobile manufacturers and their large suppliers communicate production and scheduling requirements via EDI. The assembly plant electronically sends the supplier an 8- to 12-week forecast or build plan. Daily production requirements detailing the number of parts needed at each plant at specific scheduled times are also communicated electronically. When the parts are ready and loaded in the trailer, the supplier notifies the assembly plant that the parts are on their way. The plant schedules its lines to coincide with the arrival of the trailers. By changing its assembly process to take advantage of the more accurate and timely information they receive electronically, most North American assembly locations turn inventory 130 times per year, up from 7 to 10 times per year in the past.50 In January 1994, Chrysler, Ford, GM, Johnson Controls and 12 of their suppliers began working together as part of the Manufacturing Assembly Pilot (MAP) to further improve material flow within a pilot four-tier seat assembly supply chain. At the project's outset, it took four to six weeks for material release information to reach the bottom of the supply chain. Along the way, information was distorted and truncated. The resulting late, inaccurate and untrusted information cost millions of dollars in the form of ""just-in-case"" inventories, premium freight, unplanned setups and changeovers, and other inefficiencies. By electronically connecting the MAP participants, production schedules reached the bottom of the supply chain in less than two weeks. On-time shipments improved 6 percent. Error rates were reduced by 72 percent. Up to eight hours per week per customer was saved in labor costs. Connecting all levels of suppliers through the entire industry via EDI could save nearly $1.1 billion annually--a cost savings of $71 or more per car--and decrease information lead-time to just one day between each tier of the supply chain.51 The automotive industry is now investing in a new venture, the Automotive Network Exchange (ANX), a managed ""virtual private network"" that runs over the Internet and links manufacturers and suppliers worldwide. ANX will electronically link those suppliers who still communicate to the automotive manufacturers by fax, phone and mail. And, it will replace the thousands of direct dial connections with a single network, considerably lowering the transmission costs borne by the manufacturers and the suppliers. Scheduled to be fully implemented by 2000, the network will electronically route product shipment schedules, CAD files for product designs, purchase orders, payments and other business information. Participating automobile manufacturers believe that ANX has the potential to reduce the product development and manufacturing cycles even further, as well as improve many other key business processes. The results achieved by the auto industry through EDI can be, and are being, replicated in many other industries. Because of its low cost and ease of use, the Internet will help accelerate the pace at which businesses communicate with each other electronically and the benefits they can realize. 18   MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE Companies are beginning to use the Internet for customer service. Having product descriptions, technical support and order status information online not only saves money by freeing up a company's own customer service staff to handle more complicated questions and manage customer relations, it can also lead to more satisfied customers. Companies have long gathered and stored information about customers and products in databases that only certain authorized employees can access. Innovative businesses are finding ways to tap the potential of that information, making it available to those who need it most--whether it's a customer service representative answering a phone call or a customer looking for account information or technical support online. Few things are more frustrating to a customer than uncertainty about when an important purchase will arrive. Too often, phone calls to a supplier result in a series of transfers from one department to another and an eventual promise to check on the status of the order and to call the customer back. This pattern consumes time and money for the customer and the seller. Delivery companies are helping their business partners solve this problem via the Internet. A customer can go to the company's Web site, enter his order number, and find out that the product is already on a FedEx or a UPS truck and is expected to arrive the next morning. This information can be retrieved from the company's Web site in less than a minute. In addition to improved customer satisfaction, companies using the Internet for customer service report savings from putting order tracking, software downloads and technical support information online. For instance, Cisco reports that its customer service productivity has increased by 200 to 300 percent, resulting in savings of $125 million in customer service costs. Dell estimates that it saves several million dollars a year by having basic customer service and technical support functions available on the Internet.  LOWER SALES AND MARKETING COSTS An individual sales person can support as many customer accounts as he can physically visit or contact by telephone. Therefore, as the number of accounts increases, so does the size of the sales force. Even direct marketing companies increase staffing as telephone order volume increases. By contrast, a Web business can add new customers with little or no additional cost. Because its sales function is housed in a computer server rather than physical store locations or sales people, its reach is bounded only by the capacity of the servers to respond to inquiries and orders. The Internet can also make traditional sales organizations, layered distribution channels, catalog sales and advertising more efficient. With automated ordering capabilities, sales representatives no longer have to prepare time-consuming manual orders. Instead, they can spend time building 19   and maintaining customer relationships. Electronic catalogs present far more information and options than their paper counterparts. Direct marketing online can shorten repurchase cycles and increase the ability to sell additional items. Some recent business examples suggest the potential of the Internet as an efficient sales tool. Boeing's spare parts business debuted its PART Page on the Internet in November 1996, allowing its airline customers around the world to check parts availability and pricing, order parts, and track the status of their orders. Less than a year later, about 50 percent of Boeing's customers use the Internet for 9 percent of all parts orders and a much larger percentage of customer service inquiries. The Boeing spare parts business processes about 20 percent more shipments per month in 1997 than it did in 1996 with the same number of data entry people. And, because customers can satisfy many service requests online, as many as 600 phone calls to customer service representatives are avoided each day. Cisco builds virtually all its products (routers, switches and other network interconnect devices) to order, so there are very few off-the-shelf products. Before the company established an Internet sales capability, ordering a product could be complicated. Generally, an engineer at the customer site knew what type of product was needed and how it should be configured. The engineer communicated this information to his procurement department who then created the purchase order and sent it to Cisco via fax, phone or e-mail. A Cisco customer service administrator entered the order into Cisco's system. If the order went through ""clean"", it would be booked and production scheduled within 24 hours. Nearly one out of four orders didn't get a ""clean"" bill of health, however. Instead, when Cisco's system tried to validate the order, it discovered an error in how the product was configured. The ""dirty"" order would be rejected, the customer contacted and the procurement cycle would begin again. In July 1996, Cisco rolled out its Web-based ordering and configuring system. Today, that same engineer can sit down at a PC, configure the product online, know immediately if there are any errors, and route the order to the procurement department. Because the customer's pricing structure is already programmed into the Cisco site, the authorized purchaser can complete the order with a few keystrokes. And, rather than calling Cisco to find out the status of the order, invoice or account information, a customer with the proper authorization can access the information directly on the Web site. With the online pricing and configuration tools, about 98 percent of the orders go through the system the first time, saving time both at Cisco and the customer's site. Lead times have dropped two to three days, and customers' productivity has increased an average of 20 percent per order.  NEW SALES OPPORTUNITIES The Internet operates around the clock and around the world. As a result, businesses on the Web can reach new markets they could not reach effectively with an in-person sales force or advertising campaigns. 20   For instance, a plastics commodity specialist at a large manufacturer can sit down at his PC, click on a Web browser and search for suppliers selling industrial plastics online. A small supplier with a limited sales force can now reach that buyer, getting its first introduction online. Similarly, a vendor's sales force may not be able to reach the millions of home offices and small offices around the country. By having an online presence and creating customized services for the small business market, that vendor may develop a new, lucrative market, both within the U.S. and globally. Companies using the Internet to sell products find that they attract new customers. For example, eighty percent of the consumers and half of the small businesses who purchased from Dell's Web site had never purchased from Dell before. One out of four say that if not for the Web site, they would not have made the purchase. And, their average purchase value is higher than Dell's typical customer. W.W. Grainger, the leading distributor of MRO supplies in North America, describes similar results. The company launched its Web business in the spring of 1995. Today, more than 30 percent of the company's online sales are to new customers or incremental sales to existing customers. Because the virtual store is open seven days a week, 24 hours a day, customers who wouldn't otherwise be able to order from a Grainger store are now able to do so. In fact, more than 50 percent of all orders are placed after 5 PM and before 7 AM when the local store is closed.  THE FUTURE Businesses that use the Internet to buy, sell, distribute and maintain products and services are realizing significant cost savings and increased sales opportunities. And, the benefits only increase as the network of businesses conducting electronic commerce grows. Investments are already taking place to realize the $300 billion in business-to-business Internet commerce analysts predict by 2002.52 Three of the companies discussed in this chapter--Cisco, Dell and General Electric--were responsible for about $3 billion in Internet commerce in 1997. If their current projections prove accurate, these three companies alone will conduct more than $17 billion in Internet commerce within three to five years.53 The experiences of these and other companies are quickly spreading through the rest of U.S. industry through conferences and consulting firms who assist companies to design and implement Internet-based business solutions. Even at $300 billion, Internet commerce will only represent 3 percent of total GDP.54 This means that the greater efficiencies companies are experiencing from electronic commerce are likely to continue to diffuse through the U.S. economy for decades to come. Meeting legal and technical hurdles Businesses have raised three potential inhibitors to the widespread adoption of Internet commerce: the lack of a predictable legal environment, concerns that governments will overtax the Internet, and uncertainty about the Internet's performance, reliability and security. 21   For a business to feel comfortable about using the Internet in communications with its suppliers and customers, it needs to be sure of the identity of the party at the other end of the transaction and that any agreement made electronically is binding. Today, a business verifies identities with passwords, electronic signatures and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Initiatives are currently underway to develop a more effective system of digital certification and authentication. The U.S. Government is promoting the development of an international convention to legally recognize digital authentication. The U.S. government also supports the development of both a domestic and global uniform commercial legal framework that will recognize, facilitate and enforce electronic transactions worldwide. Internationally, the U.S. government is working with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) which has completed work on a model law that supports the commercial use of international contracts in electronic commerce. The government is also encouraging the work of the International Chamber of Commerce which has issued model commercial code guidelines. Companies are also concerned about the potential for excessive taxation of the Internet. The U.S. Government believes that no new discriminatory taxes should be imposed on Internet commerce. It also believes that no customs duties should be imposed on electronic transmissions. The application of existing taxation on commerce conducted over the Internet should be consistent with the established principles of international taxation, should be neutral with respect to other forms of commerce, should avoid inconsistent national tax jurisdictions and double taxation, and should be simple to administer and easy to understand. Some companies express conduct EDI transactions information will arrive at network service provider concern about the Internet's current technical limitations. Those who over VANs have the confidence and experience that important its destination, on schedule, intact. If any problems do arise, a single is accountable and responsible for resolving them.  Companies expecting this level of service worry that the Internet offers no such guarantees. Because it is a public network that connects many smaller, interconnected networks and service providers, there is no single entity responsible for ensuring that a message leaves one point and arrives, intact, at another. And, because companies have a need to transmit confidential information, they want assurance that it remains secure. Companies are taking different approaches to address the current technical limitations. Some use the Internet to purchase lower-value, indirect materials while keeping their higher-value, direct material purchases over VANs. Some rely on extranets, or ""virtual private networks,"" that limit access to a certain pre-qualified set of businesses and their partners. Sophisticated encryption products and firewalls are being used by some companies to protect privacy and ensure the security of Internet transactions. Many others await a resolution of current export limitations on encryption software before they plan to increase their Internet business. 22   The automotive industry's ANX is an example of an extranet that will provide automotive trading partners with a single, secure network for electronic commerce and data transfer. The industry has created a management structure and business rules to ensure that the network meets the performance, reliability and security requirements the industry has put forward. The ANX Overseer, Bellcore, has direct operations and management responsibilities over the network. Participating Internet Service Providers and Network Exchange Points have been certified and will operate according to the terms of the ANX. A common set of business practices, including ""acceptable use"" policies and common network level security methods are additional conditions of participation in the ANX. Businesses will pursue alternatives most suitable for their immediate business requirements. For some, standard off-the-shelf solutions running over the public Internet are satisfactory. For others, customized solutions--along with explicit rules and operating procedures--may be the answer. As the Internet's performance and reliability improves over time, and as predictable legal frameworks emerge, the growth of business-to-business electronic commerce will accelerate.  23   CHAPTER FOUR: DIGITAL DELIVERY OF GOODS AND SERVICES  Software, CDs, magazine articles, news broadcasts, stocks, airline tickets and insurance policies are all intangible goods whose value does not rely on a physical form. Much of today's intellectual property is produced, packaged, stored somewhere and then physically delivered to its final destination. The technology exists (or soon will exist) to transfer the content of these products in digital form over the Internet.  CONTENT News from around the world is now available on the Internet, usually free of charge. More than 2,700 newspapers have online businesses, of which over 60 percent are U.S.-based.55 All but three of the top 50 magazines in the country (as defined by paid circulation) had a Web presence as of January 1998.56 More than 800 TV stations across the U.S. have Web sites.57 UltimateTV.com lists 151 U.S. cable channels including CNN, fX, HBO, MTV, the Weather Channel and a host of others.58 AudioNet calls itself the leader in Internet broadcasting, with live continuous broadcasts of over 175 radio and television stations, play-by-play of thousands of college and professional sporting events, live music, on-demand music from the CD Jukebox (over 1,600 full-length CDs), live and on-demand shows and Internet-only Webcasts and live and on-demand corporate and special events. The rapid emergence of information services on the Internet is being driven by consumer demand, more effective distribution, and an expected shift in advertising revenues away from traditional media to the Internet.  Consumer Demand Nearly 90 percent of Web users go online to get news and information.59 There, they can find obscure or limited circulation journals online as well as the top sellers. Articles limited to text and perhaps a picture in a print edition may be supplemented in the online version with video or audio clips, maps or in-depth background research. Still somewhat difficult to navigate, the Internet's wide selection of content sites save individuals time when conducting research, and yield much more complete and up-to-date information than offline alternatives. As technology advances and search tools become easier to use, individuals can be expected to increasingly turn to the Internet's content sites to do research, to learn about the day's news, and to be entertained.  24   How quickly individuals change their behavior in favor of the Internet, and away from other media, is difficult to determine. Recent studies indicate that as use of the Internet increases, television viewing declines.60 However, some of today's Web businesses point out that circulation for their existing newspapers and magazines has not dropped, even while their Web audiences increase. They state that some in the online audience are also found among their most loyal print readers, but look to each medium to satisfy different purposes. For instance, Business Week reports that visitors to its Web site read the front page article and then use the site to research the magazine's archives and special report sections, features they do not have in the print version. It may take a number of years before the impact is felt. For instance, McGraw-Hill's financial information services division began to distribute its products electronically over ten years ago. Up until three years ago, print revenues made up 85 percent of the division's sales. Today, digital products account for more than 50 percent of sales. Lower Capital and Distribution Costs The New York Times invested $350 million in its new printing press. Readers can now see frontpage photos in color instead of black and white. Readers accessing the New York Times on the Web not only see color photos from the print version's front page, they get radio clips, color spreads on special feature sections for the Web only, and the chance to interact with other New York Times readers interested in the day's or week's hot topics. Web content businesses require a much lower capital investment than their print counterparts, lowering the barrier to entry in this online industry. With the Internet, the content of a newspaper or a magazine does not have to be printed and delivered to news stands or doorsteps across the city in order to be consumed--steps that add 30 to 40 percent to the cost of the product. Instead, content delivered via the Internet can be entered directly into a computer, stored digitally on a server and appear directly on a reader's computer screen with a few simple commands the reader enters on the Web site. The consumer can then read the information on the screen or print it out. The publisher's distribution costs include paying off the investment in the Web servers and other technology that ensures that when someone enters the site, it responds quickly. Unlike newspaper or magazine content that gets used once, digitally-stored content offers the potential for repeated repackaging and reuse. Once the content has been created and stored, there is little or no extra cost to send it to one reader or 1,000 readers. That increases the efficiency of the newspaper and magazine businesses dramatically. However, simply establishing a presence on the Internet does not guarantee that a business will succeed. Building brand awareness through advertising and marketing is critical to success in a new and rapidly evolving market, particularly on the Internet where consumers have the choice of spending their time and money at thousands of different sites. If the Internet evolves in such a way that a limited number of sites become the ""funnel"" that guides a viewer through its vast content, businesses looking to appeal to mass audiences may have to pay large fees to secure ""shelf space"" on those sites. Or, they may be excluded altogether. In this scenario, advertising 25   and marketing costs may become too expensive for some to bear. If, on the other hand, technology and consumer preference evolves so that consumers access and navigate the Internet using a variety of devices and tools (perhaps personal software ""agents""), then high rents might be avoided. Statistics on Web traffic indicate that the ""funnel"" model is winning out today. Over time, as people begin to access the Web via their TVs, telephones and personal digital assistants, and as the Web becomes easier to navigate, this may change and lower advertising and marketing costs may result.  Shift of revenue sources to the Internet Even with their lower costs of operation, content businesses on the Web do not yet generate adequate revenues. Unlike newspapers and magazines that rely on subscriptions for some of their revenue, most Web businesses currently shy away from charging subscriptions in favor of building an audience and attracting advertising and direct marketing/transactions revenues. Though growing, these revenue sources are still small. At this early stage of development, it is unclear how quickly Internet content businesses will draw readers or viewers away from traditional media sources such as newspapers, magazines and television. As it happens, advertising and subscription revenues flowing to the Internet are likely to increase. Even if the total audience for a newspaper or a TV sitcom does not decline, advertisers may shift spending to the Internet if they feel that it provides a more effective means to reach their audiences. Current trends in classified and local advertising spending indicate a shift already taking place. Newspapers have been watching their share of classified advertising dollars shrink as real estate agents, car dealers and owners, and businesses looking to hire employees increase their advertising in niche publications, direct mail and online services. A 1996 Newspaper Association of America study points out that newspaper publishers could lose as much as 50 percent of their classified ad dollars in the next five years if current trends continue. If that happens, the average newspaper's operating margin, now 14 percent, would drop to 3 percent.61 To maintain revenues from classifieds and to attract local advertising dollars, newspapers have been quick to establish Web sites featuring classified ads and city guides. Other industries are also seeking a share of classified and local advertising revenues. Software companies, telephone companies, Internet service providers, television networks and newspapers are gearing up to compete for a share of this potentially large market. A New York-based research firm, Find/SVP, reported that more than 60 corporations ranging from Warner Brothers and PacTel to NBC and U.S. West have launched, or are in the process of organizing, Web sites with a strong emphasis on local content.62  26   Software companies and search engines feature city guides listing movies and restaurants, arts and music, current events, places to go, local sports, weather and news. Some broadcast and cable networks combine coverage of national news and entertainment with local news from affiliates and searchable databases of online classified ads. Directory listings and mapping services partner with newspapers, software companies and others to offer their own city guides. Telephone companies have their own directory listings and mapping services and are partnering with others for real estate listings, restaurant guides, and other local information and services. Analysts project significant growth in revenues available for online content businesses. Forrester Research predicts that revenues from advertising, subscriptions and transactions fees will grow to $8.5 billion within five years,63 or almost 5 percent of the $175 billion advertisers spent in newspapers, TV, radio, direct mail, billboards, and other traditional media in 1996.64  TRAVEL Vacationers and business travelers can now find information on the Internet about cities they plan to visit, from driving directions and recommended itineraries to weather patterns and business telephone numbers and addresses. Many hotels have detailed property descriptions, along with photos of the property's grounds, public rooms and bedrooms. Rental cars can be reserved online. Top travel magazines offer online suggestions for the best week-end getaways. The largest initial online travel business is the sale of airline tickets. Web-based travel services offer the reservations engines that airline customer service representatives and travel agents use directly to leisure and business travelers. Customers enter point-to-point destinations, desired travel times and dates, preferred airlines, and other preferences into the reservation system. The system processes the information and delivers a choice of options, along with a secure transactions environment for customers who wish to purchase the ticket online. In 1996, Web users booked $276 million worth of travel this way. For 1997, online travel sales are estimated to have reached $816 million. By the year 2000, online travel sales could reach $5 billion,65 or close to 7 percent of U.S. airlines' revenues for passenger air travel.66 According to a survey released in November 1997 by the Travel Industry Association of America, 13.8 million Americans used the Internet to plan their trips and 6.3 million made reservations on the Internet. And, consumer acceptance is growing. In 1996, 10 percent of Internet users used the Internet to make travel plans and purchases. When polled in 1997, nearly 70 percent of Internet users said they planned to use the Internet for travel in the upcoming year. Acceptance is high among the general population, as well. Thirty-eight percent of all adults said they would consider using the Internet for their travel in 1998. Lower sales and marketing costs, and increased consumer choice and convenience are driving the Internet's increased use in travel planning and reservations.  27   Lower sales and marketing costs It is cheaper for an airline to process a ticket sale online than to use a travel agent or a reservations center. Not only are transaction fees reduced, but savings are also realized when cheaper electronic tickets can be substituted for more expensive paper tickets. Through the use of the Internet and other information technology, airlines expect to be able to significantly cut distribution costs. At $12 billion, distribution--travel agent commissions, marketing and advertising expenses, labor and other expenses for airline central reservations services--is the airline industry's second largest operating expense.67 Figure 7. Cost to Process Airline Tickets $8.00: Travel agent books, using computer reservation system $6.00: Travel agent books direct with airline $1.00: Customer books ""electronic ticket"" direct with airline Source: Air Transport Association of America, 11/20/97  How a ticket is sold, through an agent or by the airline directly, and whether the ticket is paper or electronic, can mean the difference between paying $8.00 or $1.00 to process a ticket (Figure 7).68  Airlines are pursuing various strategies to drive their distribution costs down: lowering travel agent commissions, selling through the Internet and promoting electronic ticketing. Southwest Airlines was the first major U.S. airline to let passengers buy tickets directly on their Internet site in 1996, bypassing the agent and the commission. New Web travel services quickly emerged: online travel sites sponsored by airlines themselves, ""virtual"" travel agents like Microsoft's Expedia.com and The SABRE Group's Travelocity.com, and travel agents' own sites. Whether customers purchase tickets on an airline's site or through online travel agents, the airlines save money since their own travel reservations centers do not have to be involved in the purchase. In addition, the commissions they pay to online agents are about half what they pay to traditional agents.69 While the airlines' ability to move customers away from paper tickets to lower-cost electronic tickets does not depend on the Internet, it is proving to be a useful vehicle for accelerating the shift. Some airlines encourage their Internet customers to use electronic tickets by offering frequent flyer miles for travel booked online with an electronic ticket. Because Internet customers reserve their tickets, select seats and give credit card information online, getting an electronic ticket rather than a paper one seems natural. Airlines also use the Web to generate additional revenues. No matter how precise an airline's forecasting, seats still go unsold on some flights. Auctioning airline seats to the highest bidder and offering special ""cyberfares"" for leisure travel are two techniques made possible by the Internet. 28   Every Monday or Tuesday, American Airlines looks at its yield management results and picks out low-performing markets. Midweek, more than one million ""NetSAAver"" subscribers receive an e-mail from American Airlines listing special discounted fares for travel in selected markets during the upcoming weekend. The NetSAAver program has generated tens of millions of incremental dollars for the airline since its launch in March 1996.  RETAIL BANKING Internet banking is still in its infancy. Although most of the top 100 banks in the U.S. have a Web site, the Online Banking Report classifies 24 of them as ""True Internet Banks""--banks that let their customers review balances, transfer funds and pay bills on their Web sites. Smaller banks also have Web presences. In Online Banking's list of 133 ""True Internet Banks,"" 109 do not make the list of the top 100 U.S. banks ranked by assets.70 Before the decade is out, customers are likely to be able to do most of their banking transactions on the Web. According to a 1996 Booz-Allen & Hamilton survey of North American financial institutions with Web sites, 80 percent of respondents planned to allow their customers to conduct most traditional banking transactions over the Internet within three years.71 Online retail banking is being driven by lower operating costs, the ability to offer new services, and the ability to do one-to-one marketing.  Lower operating costs Online banking services are less expensive to offer to customers than other forms of banking. Checking an account balance or transferring funds from a checking account to a savings account can be done in person at a branch bank, over the telephone, with an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM), at home using a PC, or, in some cases, on a bank's Web site. A branch bank can serve as many customers as it has staff to handle. Once the investment is made to create a fully functioning Internet site (for a  Figure 8. Internet Banking is Cheaper for Banks  1.2 1.07  1 Cost per Transaction ($) 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.27  0.52  0.2 0 0.01 0.015  Internet  PC Banking  ATM  Telephone  Branch  Source: Booz-Allen & Hamilton  29   large bank, the initial investment could be millions of dollars; a more limited solution for a small bank might cost tens of thousands of dollars), the bank's Web site can handle one customer inquiry or tens of thousands a day. Booz-Allen & Hamilton estimates that it costs about a penny to conduct a banking transaction using the Internet and more than one dollar if handled by a teller at a branch bank (Figure 8).72 New Services Today's online banking allows customers to check account balances, transfer funds, and update customer information--transactions that can already be performed through traditional banking channels. For some customers, the convenience of banking from home or the office is preferable to calling the bank's automated phone service or going to a branch bank. Others do not find the services offered online today reason enough to change their banking habits. In the future, analysts expect that Internet banking will be enhanced with new services that make online banking easier and more convenient than banking by ATM, by phone, or visiting the branch bank. Paying bills electronically is one such example. Checks are the preferred method of bill payment in the United States.73 For a business, preparing and sending paper bills can be costly. For a consumer, paying bills by check can take a great deal of time. Billers print out and mail the bills to a consumer's home. The consumer writes a check, records the check number and amount paid, balances the checkbook, finds a stamp and mails the check back to the biller. The biller receives the check, updates his accounts and sends the check to the bank to credit to his account. Handling paper bills and checks can cost a biller between $1.65 and $2.70 each time he sends out a bill.74 It costs the customer time and the price of a stamp to pay each bill. Today's Internet-based bill payment services take some of the paperwork out of the process. Rather than writing a paper check and mailing it to the vendor, a customer authorizes his bank to pay bills on his behalf. This saves the customer some time, and may save the vendor some money, if all steps are completed electronically. However, vendors still incur the costs of mailing the bill to the customer. And, smaller vendors without an electronic connection still have a series of manual and paper-based steps to complete. Some banks believe that future Web-based bill payment services can make the entire process paperless. The vendor will send an electronic image of the bill to the customer's bank. The customer will electronically authorize the bank to pay the bill, the bank will debit the customer's account, and the vendor will receive payment electronically. The vendor's printing and mailing costs are eliminated, and processing costs are greatly reduced. The customer enjoys the convenience of paying bills without having to keep stamps and envelopes on hand. With services that automatically update account balances, the customer also saves time he formerly spent balancing his checkbook.  30   One-to-one Marketing Today, most banks are still equipping their Web sites with basic transactions processing and do little with tailored or one-to-one marketing. However, some now realize that through the Internet, a bank can get to know a customer's banking priorities and preferences even better than it could when banking was done in small neighborhood branches. Bank of America's ""Build Your Own Bank"" provides an example of how one-to-one marketing could work. Internet customers using this service provide the bank with basic information about their place of residence, occupation, age, income and gender, whether they own or rent a home, and what types of accounts they have with the bank. They then indicate their financial interests and priorities--whether saving and investing, home buying/improvement, building a business, retirement, economic and financial markets, electronic commerce, or simply better financial organization and budgeting. Based on these inputs, the bank responds with Money Tips and news items geared to the customer's interests, and special offers for the services the customer has prioritized. These and similar mechanisms give banks the opportunity to cross-sell products and services. Ideally, the customer benefits from these tailored offerings, as well. At a minimum, he should benefit from greater convenience. Because his account profile automatically gets called up when the customer logs into a personalized site, he wastes no time entering account information. Having up-to-date information about balances in each account gives the customer a snapshot of his holdings with the bank without having to do the math himself. The personalized tips and special offers may help the customer to make important financial decisions.  The Future Over the next few years, a growing number of American households are expected to do their banking online--whether through a dial-up connection to their bank or through the Internet. Roughly 4.5 million households were banking online in 1997. By the year 2000, as many as 16 million households are expected to bank online.75  INSURANCE Insurance carriers' Web sites typically provide customers with basic corporate and policy information, but refer customers to offline agents or customer service phone representatives in order to make a purchase. A more limited number of carriers' sites, and other sites, including banks, securities brokerages, real estate companies and automobile marketplaces, allow Internet customers to purchase term life, automobile and homeowners' insurance online.  31   Table 4. Internet Sales of Personal Insurance Projected to Grow 1997 $21 M $17 M $1.1 M $39.1 M 2001 $850 $108 $152 $1.1 By 2001, analysts project that more than $1 billion in premiums will be generated via the Internet (Table 4).76 The rapid increase in sales will be driven by cost savings, increased competition and growing consumer acceptance.  Auto Term life Homeowner Total  M M M B  Source: Forrester Research  Cost savings Distribution costs for life and property and casualty policies can be as high as 33 percent or more of the product's price.77 Selling policies and providing customer service over the Internet is much less expensive than via an agent or a telephone representative--as much as 58-71 percent lower over the lifetime of a customer.78 In a direct online sale by the carrier, the agent commission is avoided. If the sale is completed by an online agent such as Quicken InsureMarket, it can be more than cut in half. Even if a traditional agent completes the transaction started on the Internet, the transaction is less expensive. The Internet prequalifies the customer for the agent, saving sales time and expense. The Internet can also be used for electronic communication between agents and carriers, reducing time spent on routine tasks such as applications processing, updating customer account information, and reporting on the status of claims. In addition to saving money, the Internet can generate new sales opportunities. Carriers that traditionally sell through agents may pick up new customers on the Internet that agents cannot effectively reach. Because of the time needed to acquire a new customer, agents tend to focus on clients they believe will buy larger policies. One insurer, Lincoln Benefit Life, reports differences in the face value of the policies it sells via the Internet and through independent agents. The majority of policies sold by an agent have face values of $500,000 or greater. Online, Lincoln reaches customers who wish to purchase policies with face values of $500,000 and under.  Increased competition Banks and securities brokerages have begun to sell insurance in their aim to be the one-stop shop for consumers' financial services needs. Whether through alliances with insurers or in direct competition with them, these new entrants will affect how insurers go to market. At the moment, both banks and securities brokerages are embracing the Internet more rapidly than insurers.  32   Growing consumer demand Surveys indicate that people would like to be able to get quotes, pay premiums and update their policies online--functions that are not yet provided on most insurance carriers' sites today. Insurance executives believe that within five years, their customers will prefer to receive auto and term life policies online to purchasing from an agent. They will get product information and quotes, pay premiums, compare prices, access their access and update their policy information, and get advice from financial service purchase and use the Web to claims status, experts.79  THE FUTURE Most industry watchers predict that the market for the digital delivery of products and services will evolve quickly. The rate varies considerably by industry, however. Selling travel online appears to have the fewest constraints, perhaps because computer reservations systems have been in place for years. Analysts predict rapid growth in travel services, from less than $1 billion in 1997 to close to $8 billion within three to five years.80 Similarly, the financial services area is poised for quick growth. Nearly 5 million people actively trade stocks online and pay $8 - $30 per trade (traditional brokerages charge an average of $80 per trade).81 Investment bank Piper Jaffrey estimates that $614 million in broker commissions were generated online in 1997. This represents more than 4 percent of total retail brokerage commissions and 29 percent of the $2.1 billion in commissions attributable to the discount brokerage sector.82 Analysts predict that 10-16 million households will bank online by 2000, more than double the number in 1997.83 Internet-generated premiums for insurance are expected to grow from $39 million in 1997 to $1.1 billion by 2001.84 Other digital products and services have significant growth potential, but their long-term success is tied to solutions for protecting copyrights and to improvements in the Internet infrastructure. Intellectual property holders--software developers, recording artists and record companies, movie studios, authors and publishers--worry that digital copies sold or transmitted over the Internet may be prone to copyright infringement and piracy. The Internet is a natural, low-cost distribution channel for these digital products, but the uncertainty of whether their products can be protected impedes growth. Companies are working with technological solutions such as ""watermarks"" and ""digital object identifiers"" so that they can keep track of their products online. In December 1996, governments negotiated treaties at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to address the question of how copyright should be recognized and protected in global Internet commerce. The U.S. government is working to have these treaties ratified in the U.S. and around the world.  33   For the multimedia industry, the question of bandwidth is crucial. Until Web users can download a video in a matter or seconds, Web sites will not create many video products to sell online and Web users will prefer to read text, watch television or use their VCR. Increased bandwidth will also benefit education and health care services. Educational services will be able to use more video programming to supplement other online resources. The Web can also be a very useful tool in medical education and for the delivery of health care diagnostic services. Today's Web users can access some information from their health plans and physicians about medical conditions, symptoms and suggested treatments. Increasingly, they will be able to schedule appointments, pay bills, and check the status of their claims online. As new equipment is developed for remote diagnosis, doctors will be able to diagnose some medical conditions and recommend treatments to patients via the Internet (state laws and regulations regarding telemedicine and licensure may limit how widely remote diagnosis is used). However, because some medical diagnostics require very high-quality images (poor resolution could give the impression of a tumor or a fracture where none exists, for instance), improvements in bandwidth, image quality and reliability will need to occur before telemedicine and remote medical diagnostics emerge as viable industries on the Internet.  34   CHAPTER FIVE: RETAIL SALE OF TANGIBLE GOODS  In addition to goods and services that can be delivered electronically, the Internet is also used to sell physical goods. Increasing demands on leisure time and the improvement of overnight and second-day delivery services that spurred the growth of catalog shopping in the 1980s and 1990s are now leading people to shop over the Internet. A fall/winter 1997 CommerceNet/Nielsen study found that 10 million Web users in the U.S. and Canada (about 16 percent of all Internet users in North America) have actually purchased something on the Web, up from 7.4 million six months earlier. A much larger number use the Web to shop, but they still close the transaction over the telephone or at a store.85 Internet consumers report that they shop on the Web because of convenience, ease of research and good prices.86 Where most Internet shoppers bought computer software and hardware a year ago, today's shoppers buy more mainstream items. America Online (AOL), the largest Internet Service Provider with 11 million customers, reported a shift in online buying patterns during the 1997 holiday season. Apparel climbed to the top spot, and books, to third place this year. Also popular were food, flowers, music and toys.87 Internet retailers pursue a variety of strategies to attract customers. Just as one would find in traditional retailing, specialty retailers, large discounters and malls/marketplaces have their places online. Internet consumers may also visit online auction houses or use a ""personal agent"" to help with their shopping. Most Internet stores try to make online shopping as familiar and as easy as possible. Physical products arranged on store shelves are replaced with electronic catalogs that include photographs, detailed product descriptions, pricing and size information. Third-party reviews may be available to assist the buyer in choosing between different brands or models. When ready to make a purchase, the customer clicks on the product and puts it into a virtual ""shopping cart,"" and may continue shopping or proceed directly to check out. First-time customers enter basic name and address information, along with a credit card, hit the enter key on the computer, and the transaction is completed. Recognizing that customers may want to speak with a company representative directly in some instances, many Internet retail sites offer toll-free customer service numbers. Just as traditional bookstores feature tables of bestsellers and gift books, and organize racks of books by subject area, Internet bookstores also provide guides through their vast virtual selection. For those who know the title or the author of the book, a keyword search scans the entire inventory in a matter of moments, retrieves the title, along with a brief description and review of the book, and a button to add it to the customer's shopping cart. Visitors may also browse for a 35   book according to topic. The topic can be as broadly defined as ""history"" or as narrowly defined as ""Civil War."" At the same time they borrow from concepts familiar to traditional retail, Internet merchants do not think that merely duplicating what can be found offline is enough to convince customers to shop online. Early pioneers of Internet retail talk about attracting customers with additional value, selection and entertainment. The Cendant Corporation, a $5.3 billion consumer goods and services company, sells over one million products and services on its Web site, from cars to electronics and cameras, books, appliances, luggage, perfume, flowers and gifts, computer hardware and software, video games and a variety of other goods and services. For an annual membership fee of $69, Cendant claims that its netMarket Web site satisfies 20 percent of the average family's shopping needs. Because the company's business model relies almost entirely on membership fees, Cendant reports that it sells products to retail customers at, or near, wholesale prices. In 1997, Cendant facilitated the sale of more than $1.2 billion worth of products and services over the Internet. Before the decade comes to a close, the company plans to offer a product selection which will cover 95 percent of the products a typical household would buy. Internet Shopping Network's First Auction site aims to attract Internet users looking for adventure, entertainment, and seeking a bargain. People from all over the country bid against each other in real-time to ""win"" products. First Auction starts many of its bids at $1.00, well below a product's cost. Bidders quickly bid up the price, competing with each other to take possession of golf clubs, CD players, television sets, jewelry and a range of other items. Launched in July 1997, First Auction's membership roster approached 100,000 people by the end of 1997, and 30,00 people visited the site each day. An Internet shopper need not go to a ""store"" in order to buy something. In fact, the concept of retail is blurring. Some media sites, online service providers and search engines prominently feature retailers and provide direct links to their sites. Some give customers the ability to buy goods directly from their own sites. Time Warner, the media and entertainment company, has a marketplace on its Web site featuring retailers selling books, music, travel, computers and electronics, vitamins and more. Visitors using Yahoo!'s search engine can buy products from The Visa Shopping Guide by Yahoo!. A shopper who wants to buy a pair of ladies' shoes, but does not want to go from Web store to Web store to shop, can use the ""one search"" option and a software agent scans the offerings of participating retailers for selection and price information in one trip. An interested buyer can click on the ""buy"" button and be transported to the Web page featuring a picture and a more detailed description of the shoes at the retailer's site to finish the transaction. Even buying a car, more of an investment than a typical retail purchase, is possible to do through a number of auto marketplaces, online classified sites, and manufacturers' own sites. JD Power & Associates, a marketing information firm specializing in the automotive industry, estimates that roughly 16 percent of all new car and truck buyers used the Internet as part of their shopping 36   process in 1997, up from 10 percent in 1996. By 2000, they project that the Internet will be used in at least 21 percent of all new car and truck purchases.88 As in other areas, the growth of online retailing is being driven by cost savings, the ability to customize marketing, and increased consumer convenience. Virtual stores report lower operating costs than their physical counterparts. Costs of supporting a store infrastructure--rent and depreciation, labor, utilities and other expenses - - are almost entirely avoided online. 1-800-FLOWERS sells flowers through its own flower shops, affiliated flower shops in major cities across the country, by telephone sales and online. Although its online business generates only 10 percent of its total revenues, its profit contribution to the overall business is nearly that of its store-based business which generates 20 percent of total revenues.89 Direct marketing in traditional retail is already quite sophisticated: retailers can access and manipulate extensive databases made up of warranty information for cars, appliances and consumer electronics. Retailers can use this information to attract new customers by sending mailings to consumers living in certain zip codes that fit given demographic or other specialized profiles. Databases of existing customers may be even more detailed, allowing retailers to send more targeted offers. In either case, these direct mailings often take time and significant expense to compile, mail and then review their effectiveness. Though not really in practice yet, the Internet offers the opportunity to take direct marketing to the next level: to market directly to narrow bands of customers--even to individuals--and to do so profitably. When a customer visits a site, for example, the site may say ""hello"" and state the visitor's name. It knows who is there because of a technology that records the Internet address of the visitor and matches it to a name if the visitor has already registered or purchased something at the site. Web businesses also keep track of what an individual customer purchases. Increasingly, Web businesses will send a message to the buyer of a 28.8 kbps modem that the company now offers the latest 56 kbps modem; the person who buys a certain style and size of pants and sweaters will receive notices of new merchandise in that style or size, along with suggestions for accessories to match; the adventure traveler whose last trip was to Nepal at the height of trekking season may receive information about the newest hiking boots and multi-day packs to hit the market or an invitation to join a team traveling to Patagonia. Right now, many consumers are wary of this type of marketing, fearing a loss of personal privacy. If Web users become convinced that they can protect their privacy online at the same time they make these offers, targeted marketing will likely become commonplace. Amazon.com has taken some first steps in this direction. It greets site visitors by name, informs customers by e-mail when a particular book has arrived or sends them reviews of ""best new books"" in areas where the customer has indicated an interest. An ""instant recommendations"" feature proposes books to customers based on purchases they have made at Amazon. Customers can also get an accounting of their purchases at Amazon or see the status of their orders. 37   THE FUTURE Analysts believe that Internet retailing (where sales are actually completed on the Internet) will grow quickly, but they vary widely on just how quickly. On the conservative end, it is expected to reach $7 billion by the year 2000.90 If mail order sales are used to determine the potential for Web retail sales, as some suggest, the figure could reach $115 billion in five to eight years.91 If online shopping provides customers with a larger assortment, better prices, and greater choice than mail order companies, the figure may even exceed that projection. To make the most of the potential of the Internet, retailers will have to overcome a number of challenges. Among others, they will need to increase consumer confidence in relying on computer images and information to determine the quality and fit of a product, and simplify the process of returning defective or unwanted merchandise. They will also need to address the question of credit card security and consumer privacy.  Making Virtual Purchases More ""Real"" How can virtual images on the Internet replicate the sensation of picking up a product, feeling the material and its texture or sturdiness, trying it on (in the case of clothing) or sitting down on it (in the case of a sofa) before making the decision to buy? As described earlier, Internet retailers offer very detailed product descriptions online. Many provide toll-free numbers for customers who prefer to speak with a sales representative before making a purchase. As video and voice become more widely used, some Internet sites can be expected to give customers the choice to click on a button and speak directly with a customer service or sales representative via the Internet. As bandwidth increases, three-dimensional images that show the product from a variety of angles will supplement or replace the flat photos on most sites today. Customers visiting Internet furniture stores will be able to furnish their own homes and apartments by ""dragging and dropping"" furniture and accessory icons into rooms the customer has made to resemble those in his home. This feature will enable customers to gauge how well different pieces of furniture fit into a room of a given size, and which furniture styles or colors work best together. How well will Internet retailers satisfy demands, particularly in the U.S., for immediate gratification, no-fuss returns, and a strong customer service policy? Customers are generally interested in speed of delivery and ease of return. The emergence of extensive overnight shipping in many parts of the world already allows retailers--including those on the Internet--to provide quick, reliable service. As Web retailing increases, overnight delivery and ""drop shipping"" services from manufacturers to the customer's home are likely to grow as well. Customers who worry that they will have to make an extra trip to the post office or parcel delivery company if a product they order via the Internet is not what they had in mind may be surprised to learn that some companies will actually send packaging overnight, free of charge, 38   to a customer's home, along with instructions to return the product, free of charge, to the company.  Making transactions secure Most Internet purchases are currently made by entering credit card and delivery information on a computerized form and transmitting it electronically to the retailer. Even though consumers are accustomed to giving credit card information over the telephone, many are reluctant to give it online for fear that it will be stolen or misused. This reluctance is often cited as the largest barrier to the growth of retail sales on the Internet. Web retailers believe that concerns about credit card security will lessen, particularly as more people shop online, have trouble-free experiences, and tell their friends and relatives about them. In fact, some already detect greater comfort among their consumers this year as compared to one year ago. (1-800-FLOWERS recently reported that fewer than one-third of its customers worry about credit card security, compared to almost 75 percent in 1996.92) Word of mouth, combined with technology and standards for safeguarding sensitive information, should help to alleviate these concerns. Smart cards and digital cash will also be used for electronic commerce. Instead of reentering name, address and credit card information each time a purchase is made at a different Web site, information already stored on the smart card will be transmitted to the merchant electronically, saving steps for the consumer and reducing fraud by automatically validating the consumer's identity. For those consumers who wish to purchase goods or services anonymously, digital cash and stored value cards (cards worth a set amount of money) will also be available at banks and other companies for use over the network.  Ensuring Privacy of Personal Information Consumers worry about protecting the privacy of their personal information, as well. A majority of respondents to a recent Business Week/Harris poll mentioned privacy as the main reason they do not use the Internet. More than three-quarters of current users say they would use the Web more if privacy were guaranteed.93 Some sites request that new visitors volunteer personal information upon entering the site. In exchange for that information, they may offer ""membership"" services such as birthday reminder emails, new product announcements or newsletters. A purchase may trigger the gathering and creation of a customer profile, as Internet retailers need basic personal information in order to deliver a physical good to a customer. Or, an Internet user may leave an electronic ""footprint"" of visits to different Web sites and purchases he has made and not even be aware of doing so.  39   Often today, consumers are not given the opportunity to block the gathering of information or, when they freely give it, to indicate how they would like that information to be used (for instance, whether the company should restrict its use to internal purposes, whether it can be disseminated to external companies if specific conditions are met, or whether it can be widely disseminated). Some realize that their information has been sold without their knowledge or consent when they receive unwanted e-mail. Some may see the positive side to data collection and direct marketing the next time they go to buy a book and are presented with suggestions of new releases in keeping with their interests and past purchases. Nevertheless, they want some control over when and how their data are collected and used. In order to empower consumers to have control of their own personal information, the U.S. government is encouraging the private sector to establish codes of conduct and self-regulation. To be meaningful, the government believes that self-regulation must do more than articulate broad policies or guidelines. Effective self-regulation involves substantive rules, as well as the means to ensure that consumers know the rules, that companies comply with them, and that consumers have appropriate recourse when there is noncompliance. Consumers need to know the identity of the collector of their personal information, the intended uses of the information, and the means by which they may limit its disclosure. They should be given the opportunity to exercise choice with respect to whether and how their personal information is used. Companies creating, maintaining, using or disseminating records of identifiable personal information must take reasonable measures to assure its reliability for its intended use and must take reasonable precautions to protect it from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. In addition, consumers should have the opportunity for reasonable, appropriate access to information about them that a company holds, and be able to correct or amend that information when necessary.  Consumer retail on the Internet is already showing signs of rapid growth. As retailers address the challenges outlined above and as consumers become more familiar and comfortable with buying goods online, the Internet could emerge as an important retail channel.  40   CHAPTER SIX: CONSUMERS IN THE DIGITAL AGE  Businesses invest in information technology and electronic commerce to increase productivity, cut costs and enhance customer service. Consumers shop on the Internet because they find their choices dramatically increased. They have access to much more information when making purchasing decisions. Busy consumers can save time and find shopping more convenient as merchants serve their needs individually. Better information and greater selection, combined with lower operating costs for many Internet business may, in turn, drive reductions in prices or improvements in quality.  CHOICE The sheer number of stores that can be ""visited"" online far exceeds even the most densely populated retail areas in the country. No longer do customers find their shopping limited to the stores within a reasonable driving or walking distance or to the catalogues they receive in the mail. Online, customers can shop at stores in other states, in other countries, and at stores that do not exist in traditional formats. News and newspapers provide a vivid example. Residents of large cities already benefit by being able to buy a number of different national and regional newspapers from coin-operated machines and specialty news outlets. Outside large cities, however, the selection is much more limited. Online, readers can access news from thousands of newspapers around the world. An online reader interested in news about the 1998 winter Olympics in Nagano can access coverage in Japan's Asahi Shimbun as well as turning to coverage in the American media. The vast selection is not limited to products and services that can be delivered digitally. Web sites selling consumer electronics, gardening supplies, office supplies and other hard goods also offer larger selections than do their counterparts in traditional retail. The largest chain bookstores carry about 150,000 different books. On the Web, readers can choose from 2.5 million titles under one roof, covering both in-print and out-of-print books. In addition to general purpose bookstores, specialty stores carry books on antiques, books written in foreign languages, rare editions, and other books that would require extensive phone calls and physical trips to obtain. On the Web, readers can enter the keywords identifying the types of books they want, choose some promising sites, search their inventories, and often have the book delivered within a few days or a week.  41   CONVENIENCE Consumers cite convenience as the number one reason for making a purchase online. Shopping on the Internet can save time. A consumer does not have to travel to a store site or adjust his schedule around the store's hours. No longer does a consumer have to wait on hold for a customer service representative to answer the phone. Recognizing that customers may want products delivered as soon as possible, many sites offer next day or second-day delivery. Online support tools--order status, product availability and pricing, technical support and troubleshooting tips--are generally supplemented with toll-free numbers that customers may call for further information. The example of Garden Escape, an Internet-based gardening company, shows how combining products and services in a virtual ""store"" can save consumers a great deal of time and effort. The founders of Garden Escape wanted to create a one-stop shop for gardening needs. They began by taking an inventory of all the resources a gardener uses today: nurseries and seed catalogs for plants and tools, other retailers for specialty outdoor products; books and magazines for tips on the plants and flowers that flourish or perish in certain soil and climate conditions; gardening clubs where hobbyist gardeners share suggestions with other enthusiasts; and the extensive array of catalogs, books and CD-ROMs that help gardeners in designing a garden. By offering a virtual, rather than real, inventory, Garden Escape offers a selection of products that even the largest nursery could not possibly stock--a selection of 10,000 seeds, perennials, roses, bulbs, greenhouses, tools and other gardening products from around the world. Serious gardeners can use online software tools to design their ideal garden. For suggestions and tips, there's an online magazine, a chat room and new daily tips from the magazine's editors. A consumer with a question about a horticultural term can check out the glossary, or call Garden Escape's toll-free number.  BETTER AND MORE COMPLETE INFORMATION Web consumers are often better informed than their offline counterparts. Two examples--shopping for a car and shopping for an insurance policy--illustrate the differences between purchasing via the Internet and purchasing through traditional means. Shopping for a car can be a very complex process. model of car, outfitting it with different accessories options (whether to lease or buy and how to obtain insurance policy, and negotiating a fair price. Prior could take a lot of time, and many consumers went changes the dynamic. It involves choosing a particular make and and performance options, choosing financing the best rates), purchasing or updating an auto to the Internet, gathering that information to dealer showrooms ill-prepared. The Web  Web shoppers can view pictures of different car models and read extensive information on the car's features and performance. Financing and insurance options are also available online. 42   At Auto-by-Tel, a leading Web-based auto marketplace, shoppers can access model and pricing information, including dealer invoice pricing and manufacturer rebate information on all new and used cars from 2,700 accredited dealers from across the country. Along with a picture of the car and brief descriptions, the customer can access new-car and used-car pricing from third party sources like AutoSite, Edmund's, CarCenter and the Kelley Blue Book. After deciding which car to buy, the customer enters the zip code where he or she lives and the make and model of the car desired. A screen pops up requesting that the customer indicate what color exterior and interior he wants, the type of transmission, the number of cylinders, and when they prefer a 2-door or 4-door model. Then the customer completes a new car purchase request, selecting the manufacturer options to include on the car (radio, power windows, anti-lock brakes, sunroof, etc.) After making these selections and providing contact information, the customer's request is transmitted to the Auto-by-Tel dealer closest to the customer's home. Within 24 hours, the dealer contacts the customer with a firm price. Internet businesses selling life insurance products arm consumers with software tools that help them determine what types of insurance they might need, as well as information to enable them make educated choices between one insurer's policy and another's. Quicken InsureMarket, an Internet-based insurance marketplace, provides one illustration. Visitors maneuver through the InsureMarket site, accessing only the information they want; for example, an explanation of a term they do not understand, information about the carrier's rating, or how much and which type of insurance is suitable for them, given their family's financial profile. A consumer can comparison shop for term life policies by clicking on a button and answering some basic questions about residence, age, health, income, family situation, and the amount of insurance desired. In a matter of moments, the customer receives personalized quotes from up to seven carriers and up to four agent contact options. The system randomly generates the order of the insurance carriers providing quotes and referrals the visitor sees so as not to give an advantage to any single carrier. At a glance, the customer can compare the policies and the prices of several different carriers. Another few clicks of the mouse, and the customer has more information about each carrier and policy to determine whether a price difference between apparently similar policies is really justified. LOWER PRICES Commerce, and therefore competition, on the Internet is still undeveloped. A good deal of Internet retail is being driven by convenience, the search for a broader selection, or the opportunity to find items not readily available in ordinary retail outlets. Despite its infancy, some Internet retailers offer discounts from traditional channels. For instance, online booksellers discount some books by 40 percent over typical bookstore prices.94 (Depending on the cost of delivery, the total cost of an item may be higher on the Internet than at a store.) Consumers buying and selling stocks through the Internet commonly pay $8- $30 per trade, while traditional brokerages charge approximately $80 per trade on average.95 Internet users can access most online news and information free of charge. 43   This pattern of lower prices is not universal. Some retailers have determined that their current Internet customers buy products from them primarily because of convenience, selection or quality. In the short term, they do not feel that lowering prices would lead to additional sales. Some traditional store-based retailers set their prices for products they sell through the Internet at the level found in their stores in order not to adversely impact their store-based business. If retailing continues to grow on the Internet, competition and the favorable economics of the Internet are likely to translate into lower prices for the average consumer.  CUSTOMIZATION The Internet offers the potential for increased customization. Some Web businesses, particularly media businesses, already customize the product to an audience of one. Readers can select only the news they want to read, and it gets ""delivered"" to their personalized Web page on the site, to an e-mail box, or as a service that the computer defaults to when at rest. Music and computers are other products where the combination of innovation and economics is encouraging increased customization. Customers at online music stores have the choice of purchasing CDs available at record stores. Or, if they desire, they can create their own CDs from a growing number of digital recordings. Buying a laptop computer is no longer limited to what a store or a manufacturer has in stock. Instead, consumers can choose from a variety of base models, and purchase the standard configuration or customize the machine according to price and performance requirements. (For instance, the customer can decide whether to pay extra for a speedy 266MHz processor or save some money with a somewhat slower 166MHz processor. Similarly, the base model may have 48 MB of memory (RAM), but additional memory is available for those who need it. Different modems, network adaptors, extra batteries and software packages can be installed by the factory at the customer's request. Even the service package can be tailored to the customer's needs. Traditional retail and mail order outlets, in addition to Web businesses, offer customers the opportunity to customize their computers; the Internet and private networks speed the flow of information and thereby improve the economics of customization. Web-based clothing stores may soon incorporate technology that allows customers to ""try on"" clothing. Deciding between a Large or Extra-Large sweater may be as simple using the computer mouse to ""drag"" the virtual sweater over a 3-D image of oneself to see whether it is too snug or a perfect fit. For retailers and manufacturers who continue to produce standard sizes for their customers, this technology will simulate the physical act of trying on clothing in a store's dressing room. Other businesses may decide to build a business around tailored clothing, using the 3-D image to customize the size and fit of the sweater to that individual customer. The Internet and other new technologies may encourage businesses to explore the feasibility of mass customization; whether and how extensively retailers and manufacturers start to customize clothing, furniture, and other products based on individual customer specifications will ultimately depend on market demand. 44   THE FUTURE Today's Web consumers benefit from a selection of products and services unparalleled in traditional channels. Without leaving home or an office, consumers can access thousands of Web sites to become informed about breaking news and events, research products, and purchase everything from groceries to books to insurance policies. Whether they complete the transaction online or make the purchase at a store after using the Web to help narrow the search for a particular product, the Web arms the consumer with much more knowledge about choices and prices available to them. Despite these advantages, many consumers today still remain wary of the Internet. They are concerned about protecting their privacy and the security of their credit card information. Many do not have computers, or find them too difficult to use. Or, they prefer the experience of shopping and selecting products they can see, feel, or try on in person. For these reasons, shopping in stores will likely be the main way that consumers purchase goods for many years to come. However, the barriers to Internet shopping are likely to be lower for younger consumers. Children today are growing up with the Internet. Over the next decade, as today's children become adults, shopping on the Internet will be easy and natural to them. The growth in the numbers of individuals using the Internet provides strong evidence that consumers perceive its benefits. As more individuals come online, as the Internet becomes easier to access, as Internet commerce increases, and as today's children become adults, the combined effect will be to further enhance the already-present benefits the Internet has to offer.  45   CHAPTER SEVEN: WORKERS IN THE DIGITAL AGE  The rapid growth of the computing and telecommunications industries has already created a large and growing demand for programmers, systems analysts, computer scientists and engineers. If electronic commerce begins to substitute for more conventional sales and services, it will shift employment from traditional occupations to those requiring IT skills and, in many instances, other higher-level cognitive reasoning abilities. Electronic commerce is very much part of a broader national trend that requires more skills in the work place and an improved basic education in mathematics and science. The digital age will also create greater opportunities for telecommuting, and already strong trends towards globalization will accelerate.  CHANGING SKILL REQUIREMENTS Demand for workers in IT industries and workers with occupations focused on the design, programming, maintenance and repair of the computing and communications infrastructure will continue to grow. In 1996, more than 7 million people worked in these jobs and they earned an average annual wage of just under $46,000. Over the next ten years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that an additional 2 million workers will be needed to fill these jobs. Companies already report difficulties in filling these positions today. Workers with information technology skills are needed across the economy. An analysis of IT occupations shows that the demand for workers to fill higher-skilled IT jobs (computer engineers, scientists, and systems analysts) is expected to grow from 874,000 in 1996 to 1.8 million by 2006.96 These positions typically require a four-year undergraduate degree, often in a field of science, mathematics or engineering, and in many cases, advanced training or a graduate degree. Employment in lesser-skilled jobs like computer operators and duplicating machine operators is expected to decline from 481,000 in 1996 to 342,000 by 2006. As electronic commerce becomes more widespread, it, too, will likely drive changes in the labor market. In most cases, the share of sales generated by a company's Web business is still only a small fraction of the company's total business. As it increases, however, the composition of the workforce required to produce and deliver a product or service may shift. For instance, if online delivery of news services replaces some portion of the conventionally delivered news, workers may gradually shift away from the printing or delivery of newspapers to the creation of content or managing of computers. Workers manning printing presses, driving trucks, and staffing news stands have no role in online news distribution. Their function is 46   performed by new workers responsible for programming, operating and maintaining the computer servers that ""distribute"" the news to Web readers. The same could be true for retail as online sales begin to substitute for in-store sales. Today, a super store might be staffed by a few hundred employees. Warehouse personnel receive new merchandise into the store and keep the shelves and bins filled. Salespeople advise customers on product features, check availability of merchandise not found on the shop floor, and book special orders. Cashiers ring up the sale and bag the goods. Back-office staff keep track of inventory and sales patterns, pay vendors and payroll, deposit sales receipts, and manage the day-to-day store operations. Other workers keep the store and its grounds clean and well-maintained. A retail sale via the Internet does not require the presence of a physical store or the same intensity of staff in order to generate the sale. Virtual retailers will hire people with IT skills to develop and program software, and operate and maintain computer servers and networks. They will also need marketing staff, accounting departments, customer service representatives and people skilled in graphic design to keep their Web site, or ""storefront,"" attractive and user friendly. Whether a retailer handles the physical distribution of its own products or contracts with another company to perform that function, warehouse and distribution personnel will continue to be necessary to transport products from the manufacturer's site to the customer's home. Retailers with an existing store infrastructure are likely to position the online business as complementary to their traditional store business, at least in the near term. Until online sales are of a size to warrant a dedicated distribution strategy, traditional retailers may choose to deliver goods to Web customers from the nearest store location, adding to the workload of existing warehouse personnel. Other retailers may choose to have manufacturers package and mail or ""drop ship"" goods directly to customers without going through any intermediate steps. Or, they may outsource the entire logistics process for the online business to a third party. In any of these scenarios, few store personnel would be involved in an online sale. Jobs characterized by a transfer of information from one party to another--travel agents, insurance agents, stock brokers, customer service representatives--will likely see routine tasks like order taking disappear, and more complicated tasks replacing them. For instance, a leisure traveler making plans to go home for the holidays usually knows all the carriers flying that route and simply needs to make the reservation and pay for the flight. That would be a case of order taking, a function as easily performed online as by calling the airline or a travel agent. On the other hand, a couple planning a trip to South Africa might seek the advice of someone who has been to the region, who can recommend hotels in the wine country near Cape Town and safaris in Kruger. Similarly, someone purchasing a term life policy with a face value of $400,000 may feel comfortable enough researching and purchasing that policy online. To help make the decision of whether to buy a whole or variable life insurance policy or put the money into an Individual Retirement Account or other investment vehicle, however, he might prefer to consult an expert in person.  47   WORKFORCE FLEXIBILITY Workforce flexibility refers to a company's ability to produce products and services with less rigid organizational structures. It also refers to a worker's ability to work without being tied to a desk or an office. The growth in information technology has played an important role in both driving the need for a new work force and in enabling greater flexibility in the work place. In the old model of industrial organization, production workers performed tasks by rote, over and over again throughout a shift. A car frame rolled down an assembly line, a worker attached a part, it proceeded to the next worker who performed the next process, and on it continued until a completed car emerged at the other end. A bank teller opened accounts, accepted deposits and provided account balance information. Someone else handled transactions involving Certificates of Deposit, Money Market Accounts and safety deposit boxes. Bureaucratic work organizations are giving way to flexible ""cells"" and teams that cross the oncerigid lines of job description, management reporting structures, and business units. This transformation often results from a corporate objective to implement total quality management (TQM) and Six Sigma (a benchmark of nearly zero defects) systems throughout their organizations. Reducing errors and return rates, lowering cycle times and reducing costs means getting it done right the first time. People on the ""front lines"" - - the factory floor, the sales department, the customer service organization - - need to have the education and information to make decisions and solve problems. Companies with successful TQM and Six Sigma initiatives invest heavily in training and education. They also give employees the tools they need: clearlystated objectives and real-time feedback on how well those objectives are being met. A robust computer network with online training and support tools can reinforce (or substitute for) inclassroom training sessions. It also keeps workers up-to-date with the latest forecasts, the current day's production or sales requirements, materials shortages, and other information in order to better perform the day's tasks and anticipate future needs. As more companies move to this method of work organization, the need to share information and knowledge across the enterprise will increase. Internal corporate networks and the Internet will play an important role in enabling this transition. Thanks to personal computers, fax machines, modems and cellular phones, as many as seven million workers in the United States work at home in ""virtual offices.""97 The Department of Transportation estimates that up to 15 million workers may be telecommuting in the next decade. Organizations with telecommuting programs report an increase in productivity, faster completion of assignments, fewer sick or absent days, better time management and increased morale and commitment to the company. They also benefit from reduced office space needs and associated costs, an enhanced ability to attract and retain quality employees, and improved customer service.98  48   Telecommuting benefits employees, as well. For those who need to balance work commitments with family commitments, telecommuting provides the means for working and communicating with coworkers and clients from home. Employees working part-time can manage their time more effectively, spending less time driving to one or more offices, and instead focusing on completing work assignments.  GLOBALIZATION Information technology has opened up new opportunities for global commerce. The signals transmitted over the Internet do not recognize national borders. Work on the same project can be done in several places or several countries without workers having to physically relocate. Organizations can now deploy resources and operations around the world. Information about new product introductions, corporate earnings, forecasted sales patterns, and materials requirements can be shared almost instantaneously via corporate e-mail systems and value-added networks, and now, over the Internet. Developing software, designing a car, providing consulting services to a client, can be done collaboratively by teams of employees from different parts of the world. For instance, an engineer in California can send an e-mail at the close of her business day to a colleague in Singapore, asking him to look over the attached design specifications for a new product. By the time she arrives for work the next morning, a reply could be sitting in her ""in-box"" with a marked-up set of specifications. With the opportunities come serious challenges. Countries that have an insufficient supply of skilled workers will see high-skilled, high-paying jobs migrate to countries that can supply the needed talent. Those that have a surplus will find job opportunities opening for their workers in overseas organizations. Even though the United States has led the world into the digital age, we face these same realities. Without a concerted effort to develop students and workers to meet the new challenges of the digital economy, the United States could face a migration of high-skilled, high-wage jobs to other countries.  49   CHAPTER EIGHT: CHALLENGES AHEAD  This report has focused on the emergence of the digital economy--the promise it contains and some of the challenges it poses. Some of the challenges are technical, others involve the development of standards, and still others require significant capital investments. The digital revolution is also changing the respective roles of government and the private sector. In the 19th and for much of the 20th centuries, governments played a key role in helping build or actively regulate much of the country's infrastructure. The federal government made extensive land grants to encourage private capital to expand the nation's rail network. Government subsidies were used to stimulate the development of an airline industry. Federal and state dollars combined to build and maintain the interstate highway system. In communications, the government granted a virtual monopoly to a single company and regulated the industry after its breakup. Most power companies have been regulated monopolies at the state or federal level. The federal government funded and developed early versions of the Internet for national security and research purposes. It will continue to provide funding for research and development on future Internet and high-performance computing technologies. However, most of the capital to build the computing and telecommunications infrastructure is being provided by the private sector. The pace of technological development and the borderless environment created by the Internet drives a new paradigm for government and private sector responsibilities. Creating the optimal conditions for the new digital economy to flourish requires a new, much less restrictive approach to the setting of rules.  Governments must allow electronic commerce to grow up in an environment driven by markets, not burdened with extensive regulation, taxation or censorship. While government actions will not stop the growth of electronic commerce, if they are too intrusive, progress can be substantially impeded. Where possible, rules for the Internet and electronic commerce should result from private collection action, not government regulation. Governments do have a role to play in supporting the creation of a predictable legal environment globally for doing business on the Internet, but must exercise this role in a non-bureaucratic fashion. Greater competition in telecommunications and broadcast industries should be encouraged so that high-bandwidth services are brought to homes and offices around the world and so 50         that the new converged market place of broadcast, telephony and the Internet operate based on laws of competition and consumer choice rather than those of government regulation.   There should be no discriminatory taxation against Internet commerce. The Internet should function as a seamless global marketplace with no artificial barriers erected by governments.  As with any major societal transformation, the digital economy will foster change and some upheaval. The Industrial Revolution brought great economic and social benefit, but it also brought about massive dislocations of people, increased industrial pollution, unhealthy child labor and unsafe work environments. Societies were often slow in responding to these negative side effects. Similarly, the digital economy may bring potential invasions of privacy, easier access by children to pornographic and violent materials and hate speech, more sophisticated and far-reaching criminal activity and a host of other as-yet unknown problems. The private sector and government, working together, must address these problems in ways that make the Internet a safe environment while not impeding its commercial development. The U.S. Government's ""Global Framework for Electronic Commerce,"" posted on the Internet at http://www.ecommerce.gov, describes a market-driven framework that will stimulate the growth of the digital economy while offering flexible, industry-driven solutions that will effectively address problems that may arise. Steps are now being taken in the United States and around the world to meet these public policy goals. Perhaps the greatest challenge the U.S. faces, however, is to put in place the human resource policies necessary for the digital economy. If the trends described in this study continue, millions of jobs will likely be created, while millions of others will be lost. The good news is that the net economic growth anticipated by this digital revolution will likely create more jobs than those that are lost. Further, the jobs created are likely to be higher-skilled and higher-paying than those that will be displaced. However, it is clear that we will face great challenges in preparing the current workforce and future workers to fill the new jobs that will be created. If we do not have a sufficient number of well-educated and trained people to fill these jobs, then the good news can turn to bad. If these public policy issues can be resolved, and electronic commerce is allowed to flourish, the digital economy could accelerate world economic growth well into the next century.  51   ENDNOTES  1.

Forbes. July 7, 1997. pp.144-171. Thomas Newcomen developed the first practical steam engine in 1712, used primarily for pumping water out of mines. This engine was only practical near a source of wood or coals. James Watt's steam engine of 1769 added a separate condenser which increased the fuel efficiency by a factor of four. Due to this addition, a steam engine could be put anywhere and the fuel hauled to it. In 1782, Watt modified the engine by introducing a rotary motion that could turn a shaft. Michael Faraday first harnessed electricity in 1831 by means of motion in a magnetic field.

In the early days of the Internet, most messages were simple text that did not require large amounts of bandwidth. Bandwidth requirements have increased as people began to send images, sound, software, video and voice over the Internet. In a packet-switched system, a message is broken into chunks and each chunk or ""packet"" is individually addressed and individually routed across the network to its destination. At the destination, the message is reassembled. Packets that do not arrive at the destination are retransmitted. As Vint Cerf, one of the inventors of the Internet, describes it: Packet switching is conceptually similar to the way the postal service works. That is, each letter or postcard is individually addressed and moves geographically from point-to-point as it travels towards its destination. Two postcards mailed from a post office in San Francisco may take different routes to New York, but once they arrive at the New York City post office, they are assembled with the other mail going to the destination address and delivered. Each ""packet"" is like a postcard and network routers are like the mail stops along the way. Meeker, Mary and Pearson, Sharon. Morgan Stanley U.S. Investment Research: Internet Retail.

Forrester Research. July 1997. Forrester Research predicts that business-to-business electronic commerce will reach $327 billion by 2002. A conservative estimate for the combined online transactions for Cisco, Dell and GE in 1997 would be $3 billion. During the first 10 months of 1997, Cisco booked more than $1 billion in sales via the Internet. Although Dell did not report its 1997 sales via the Internet, a rough estimate would place them between $750 million - $1 billion for the year. GE reports having purchased over $1 billion online in 1997. In three to five years' time, Internet commerce for the three companies will, by their own estimates, reach or exceed $17 billion. Cisco expects online sales to grow to 60 percent of total volume over the next year. If analyst projections for Cisco to grow to a $10.5 billion company by July of 1999 are correct, Cisco's online sales will reach $5-6 billion by then. Dell expects to conduct half its total business online shortly after the year 2000. Even taking 50 percent of its current volume ($12 billion in 1997 and growing rapidly) would lead to $6 billion in online sales shortly after the year 2000. By 2000, GE aims to have all 12 of its business units purchasing via the Internet, for a total of $5 billion.  47.  48. 49. 50. 51.  52.  53.  54.

Domestic and worldwide use of computer hardware and software products and communications equipment and services is converging into a single market. This market supports the global information infrastructure (GII), which is dominated by the Internet. Although IT is used by all industries to some degree, industries that support the GII are, for the purpose of this report, considered to be IT industries (Table 1). The criteria for the selection of IT industries and the methodology used to derive the charts below are described in the ""Data and Methodology"" section. IT industries enable electronic commerce (e-commerce), thus their health and/or performance give some indication of the potential size and likely growth of e-commerce. This analysis presents an estimate of the size and growth of IT industries and their importance to overall U.S. economic and employment growth. Growth of IT industries provides us with some idea of the past and probable future success of e-commerce, but should not be interpreted as a direct measure of it. IT Industries and Recent Economic Performance The economy has been performing well lately, in terms of growth, employment, inflation, and productivity. Between 1996 and 1997, the economy grew 3.8 percent in inflation adjusted or real dollars, about 3 million new civilian employees were added, inflation remained low, 2.3 percent,1 and business productivity increased by 1.9 percent. Some analysts believe that growth of the IT sector helps account for a large part of this good performance and the findings in this paper lend support to their assessments. In recent testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Alan Greenspan noted that ""... our nation has been experiencing a higher growth rate of productivity -- output per hour worked -- in recent years. The dramatic improvements in computing power and communication and information technology appear to have been a major force behind this beneficial trend.""2 Other analysts believe, however, that other factors may account for recent good performance and that the data do not yet confirm whether the recent burst of activity in the IT sector has had large positive effects on the rest of the economy. Because of the lags between bursts of investment and their economic effects taking hold, we are not yet able to assess the full economic effects of the recent dramatic growth in IT investment.  A1 - 1   One of the most notable developments in recent years has been the rapid increase in the IT sector's (computing and communications) share of investment activity and the overall economy. IT grew from 4.9 percent of the economy in 1985 to 6.1 percent in 1990. In 1990, the IT share of the economy was proportional to its contribution to overall economic growth. Beginning in 1994, however, the IT sectors contributed twice its share of the economy to overall nominal economic growth. In 1996, IT industries accounted for an estimated 7.5 percent share of the economy3 and an estimated 15.8 percent of the rise in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), in current dollar terms as measured by its earned income. By 1997, IT industries accounted for an estimated 7.8 percent of GDP and 12.4 percent of its nominal growth, while in 1998, IT industries may account for as much as 8.2 percent of the economy and an estimated 14.7 percent of its nominal growth. What makes this rise in IT's nominal share of the economy even more remarkable is the fact that IT prices, adjusted for quality improvements, have been falling while prices in the rest of the economy have been rising. In 1996 and 1997, declining prices in IT industries (as measured by their overall implicit deflator) lowered the annual change in prices in the overall economy by an estimated one full percentage point. Thus, the estimated real contribution of this sector to economic expansion was greater than what the nominal shares indicate. In recent years, an average of over one-quarter of total real economic growth can be attributed to IT industries. In 1996, the IT workforce, as defined by employment in IT industries (Table 1) and employees with IT-related occupations (Table 2), across the economy, was 7.4 million workers (6.2 percent  Table 1.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that the demand for these workers will increase to 9.5 million by 2006. The fastest growing segment of IT workers is in the software and services industries. Between 1985 and 1996, employment in these industries more than doubled from just over one-half million workers to 1.2 million with an average annual wage of about $56,000. By 2006, BLS projects the demand for these workers to double again to 2.5 million. The debate over the relation of IT industries to the health of the economy will continue for some time. Although the results of this paper suggest a healthy relationship, more data and analysis, especially in the area of IT-generated productivity improvements throughout the economy and the contribution to non-inflationary growth, are needed.  A1 - 3   IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, INFLATION, AND BUSINESS INVESTMENT  Share of the Economy and Contribution to Growth The IT share of the economy, in current dollars, hovered between 4and 5-percent from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s (Figure 1). Then, as the personal computer became more common in business and in the home, the IT share of the economy jumped by 1.2 percentage points between 1985 and 1990 to reach 6.1 percent. With the commercialization of the Internet, it started its upward climb again, growing from 6.4 percent in 1993 to an expected 8.2 percent by 1998. Between 1990 and 1998, value added of IT industries are expected to roughly double, growing from $347 billion to $680 billion (Figure 2). Hardware sales, comprised of computer hardware, electronic components, and some instruments, are expected to grow from $116 billion in 1990 to $254 billion by 1998--more than doubling over the period. Software sales are expected to increase by two and one-half times from $60 billion to $152 billion. Value added of the communications industries, by comparison, is expected to increase by about 60 percent, from $171.2 billion in 1990 to $276.5 billion in 1998. Figure 1.

For instance, in 1991, IT industries accounted for 6.1 percent of the economy and 6.2 percent of overall economic growth (Figure 3A). Since the commercialization of the Internet in the mid-1990s, IT's contribution to nominal GDP growth has expanded rapidly. Between 1994 and 1998, IT is responsible for 11-16 percent of overall economic growth, while its share of the economy ranges between 6.8-8.2 percent.  Figure 3A. IT Industries: Contribution to Economic Growth Rises from 6% in 1991 to Around 14% between 1995 and 1998 (percent) 18.0 16.0 14.0 12.0 10.0 8.0 6.0 4.0 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 actual estimated  Source: ESA estimates based on BEA and Census data  The contribution of IT industries to nominal growth in the economy understates its full impact. The difference between the nominal and real contributions to growth results from significant productivity growth in some of these industries. Large gains in the quality of IT products, particularly computers and semiconductors, have been achieved without comparable increases in costs.5 Between 1992 and 1997, IT industries contributed over onequarter of the real growth in the economy.6 (Figure 3B) The IT contribution to real economic growth fluctuates considerably from year to year. From 1992 to 1994, IT growth was only slightly higher than overall economic growth.7 In 1995, a spurt of investment in IT products in combination with a rather lackluster economy resulted in a dramatic increase in the IT contribution to real economic growth. By 1997, the IT contribution to real economic growth dropped back down to just over one-quarter, primarily  Figure 3B.

The inflation adjusted measure of the IT sector may overstate its practical contribution to overall economic growth, as businesses may not yet taking full advantage of the quality improvements in the IT products. Inflation and IT Industries Since 1996, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has adopted quality-adjusted price indexes for computers and semiconductors for use in their real GDP calculations. The need to incorporate quality-adjusted deflators (sometimes called hedonic deflators) arose because of the increasing performance and declining prices of these products. Since the 1960s, the performance of microprocessors has followed Moore's Law--transistor (or microprocessor) density doubling about every 18 months. And during this time of phenomenal growth in performance, the average price of the transistor has fallen by an unprecedented six orders of magnitude. A doubling of microprocessor performance every 18 months is projected to continue for the next 20 years.8 Figure 4.

Industry Use of IT Equipment IT industries not only directly have more than proportional impact on the growth of the economy, but the use of IT products has been an important and growing part of capital investments across all industries. In 1994, of the 53 aggregate industry sectors (across the economy), 40 percent or more of the total capital stock of 15 industries was comprised of IT equipment, 13 between 25 and 39 percent, 20 between 10 to 24 percent, and only 5 had a less than 10 percent share. IT spending, in inflation adjusted dollars,10 as a share of total business equipment spending, grew A1 - 6   from negligible to 45 percent in a little over 30 years (Figure 5). In 1965, business spending for IT equipment was less than 5 percent of total business spending. By the early 1980s, IT spending jumped to about 15 percent. In the early 1990s, IT spending represented about one-third of all business equipment spending, and by 1996, almost half. The slope of the curve suggests that by 2000, business spending for IT equipment should exceed half of all spending on capital equipment. A parallel can be drawn between the proliferation of computers (and other IT equipment) in the last three decades and the spread of electricity in the mid 1800s and early 1900s.11 First harnessed  F i g u re 5. 50% 45% 40% 35% 30%  Infor m a ti o n T e c h n o l o g y S p e n d i n g a s a S h a re of B u s in e s s E q u ip m e n t S p e n d in g C o m m e rcial I nternet  P C I n troduction 25% 20% 15% 10% 5% 0% 1960 Source: 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 * Inflation-adjusted investment in information processing equip ment (office, computing, and accounting machinery, communications equipment, instru ments, and photocopying equipment) as a share of total private equipment investment.  Bureau of Economic Analysis  in 1831, electricity's potential had to wait 50 years until the first power station was built in 1882.12 Industry then began a 50-year transition from using mechanical power to using power generated by electricity. In 1899, less than 5 percent of the power used by industry was from electric power generation. Fifty years later, electricity powered 80 percent of factories and households across the country. The increase in the share of IT-related capital by industries corresponds to a decline in the share of the other categories of business equipment and can be viewed as evidence of basic structural change among and within industries. Between 1977 and 1996, the share of business spending for the major categories of capital equipment (with the exception of IT) declined--the share of business spending for industrial equipment such as engines and machinery dropped by 5 percentage points over this period (year-end estimates); transportation equipment, such as trucks and autos, dropped by 2 percentage points; and other capital equipment, such as office furniture, A1 - 7   dropped 3 percentage points. At the same time, the share of business spending for IT-related equipment increased by 10 percentage points. In some industries such as telecommunications, insurance, and securities brokerages, IT equipment constitutes over eighty percent of all the equipment used (Figure 6). IT equipment used per employee is another measure of IT intensity (Figure 7). The top 15 industries, ranked by this criterion, include telecommunications, real estate, radio and television, nonbank financial companies and utilities. They spend over $10,000 (1987 dollars) per employee compared with an economywide average of $2,500. By this measure, while telecommunications remains at the top, other industries such as banks, petroleum, chemicals, and railroad transportation make it to the top tiers as major users of IT equipment.

A1 - 8   THE IT WORKFORCE  Total employment in IT-related jobs is defined as all employees in IT industries and all employees in IT-related occupations in non-IT industries.13 In 1996, 7.4 million people worked in the IT workforce. Approximately two-thirds of these jobs were in IT industries, the other one-third were spread across the rest of the economy. The sections that follow include a separate analysis of employment in IT industries followed by a discussion of employment in IT-related occupations. Note that workers in IT industries and workers with IT-related occupations are not additive since approximately one-third of the workers with IT-related occupations are in IT industries. Employment in IT Industries Employment in IT industries has remained relatively stable even as its share of the economy has grown (Figure 8). From 1985 to 1990, employment in IT industries grew at only 0.4 percent annually, much slower than the 2.4 percent annual rate of growth for all private industries.  Figure 8.

They supplied over 230,000 of the 2.2 million increase in jobs from 1995 to 1996, or 10.5 percent (Figure 9). Employment in IT industries is projected to increase 3.0 percent annually from 1996 to 2006, more than twice as fast as the U.S. average of 1.4 percent. Although historical employment data suggest little change in aggregate IT employment, there has been a fundamental shift in employment among industries. IT industries that produce computer A1 - 9   hardware and communications equipment have lost jobs as technological changes have made some processes routine, thus eliminating jobs or reducing the need for in-house staff to perform some jobs.14 Increased outsourcing is reflected in increased employment in IT industries that provide maintenance and other support services. Also, more computer assembly is being done at the wholesale level. Among the four IT industry groups, providers of software and services have experienced the most rapid employment growth. From 1985 to 1996, employment in these industries more than doubled from 557,000 to 1.2 million workers, with the fastest growth occurring in the computer programming and prepackaged software industries (Figure 10). By 2006, software and services employment will more than double again to 2.5 million workers, still driven by computer programming and prepackaged software industries. Communications equipment and communications services have seen slow employment growth, despite above average growth in sub-industries such as household audio and video equipment retail stores and cable television. In 1996 there were 116,000 fewer workers in industries that produce computer and related hardware than in 1985. However, employment in several subindustries such as computer retail sellers and manufacturers of laboratory analytical instruments has grown faster than average.  Figure 9.

IT Industries Pay Above Average Wages  $50,000 IT industries represent a small, but growing share of the total annual $40,000 wage bill, accounting for 7.9 percent of all wages paid in 1996 $30,000 compared with 7.4 percent in 1985. Strong growth in value $20,000 added of the IT industries in the $10,000 1990s and rapid growth in productivity (as measured by value $0 added per employee) resulted in a 1985 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 corresponding increase in wages All private industries IT Industries (Figure 11).

In 1996, the average annual wages paid to workers in IT industries was almost $48,000 compared with $28,000 for all private employees.  Among the IT industries, workers in the software and services industries earned the highest annual wages, almost $56,000 in 1996 (Figure 12).

A1 - 11   hardware-related and communications services industries were similar at around $46,000 to $48,000 per year. Communications equipment workers earned about $37,000 annually. Employment in IT Occupations In addition to the IT industries themselves, IT workers are needed across the economy to install, operate, program, repair, maintain, design and develop IT equipment and services (Table 2). Table 2. IT-Related Occupations Engineering, science, and computer systems managers Electrical and electronic engineers Electrical technicians Electrical power line installers and repairers Electronics repairers Communications equipment operators Central office and PBX installers and repairers Calculating machine operators Electronic semiconductor assemblers Telephone and Cable TV installers and repairers Computer engineers, scientists, and systems analysts Computer programmers Computer and peripheral equipment operators Data entry keyers Electronic equipment assemblers Data processing equipment repairers Broadcast technicians Duplicating machine operators Electromechanical equipment assemblers Electrical and electronic assemblers  A1 - 12   In 1996, 4.2 million people worked in IT-related occupations. About one-third of these workers (1.4 million) were employed by IT industries and 2.8 million worked in non-IT industries. As an example, in 1996 there were 1.4 million computer scientists, systems analysts, computer engineers, and computer programmers. The services sector employed 47.7 percent of these workers--primarily in business services, health services, education, and engineering services. Durable goods manufacturing industries, financial services, and government were other large employers (Figure 13). The number of IT workers increased from 3.1 million in 1983 to 3.7 million in 1990 (Figure 14). After the slight decline in the early 1990s, IT jobs grew to 4.2 million by 1996.

Some IT-Related Occupations Engineering, Science, and Computer Systems Managers plan, coordinate, and direct research, development, design, production, and computer-related activities. Many have a bachelor's or master's degree in computer or information science. In 1996, the mean annual wage of these managers was almost $66,000. Computer engineers, scientists, and systems analysts--Computer engineers work with the hardware and software aspects of systems design and development. Computer scientists generally design computers and the software that runs them, and conduct research. Systems analysts use their skill in computers to develop business specific applications. Ph.D.'s or, at least master's degrees, are preferable for scientists and engineers in research labs or academic institutions. In 1996, the mean annual wage of computer engineers was almost $55,000. The mean annual wage of systems analysts and computer programmers, combined, was $48,000. Electrical and Electronics Engineers design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment, including computer hardware, and communications and video equipment. A bachelor's degree is required for beginning engineers. In 1996, their mean annual wage was about $53,000. Computer programmers write and maintain the detailed instructions that computers must execute to perform their functions. There are no universal training requirements for programmers, although the majority hold a four-year degree. In 1996, the mean annual wage of these workers (combined with systems analysts) was $48,000. Communications Equipment Mechanics install, repair, and maintain complex and sophisticated communications equipment. Most employers prefer one to two years of training in electronics. In 1996, the mean annual wage for central office and PBX installers and repairers was about $40,000. Broadcast Technicians install, test, repair, set up, and operate electronic equipment used to record and transmit radio and television programs. Employers prefer workers with training in broadcast technology or in engineering or electronics. A four-year college degree is not a prerequisite. In 1996, their mean annual wage was about $31,000. Computer and Office Machine Repairers install, maintain, and repair computer and office equipment. Most employers prefer applicants with formal one- to two-year training in electronics specializing in computers. In 1996, their mean annual wage was $29,000.  A1 - 14   BLS projects that 5.6 million workers will be needed to fill IT-related jobs by 2006. The demand for higher skilled IT jobs is expected to grow dramatically while the demand for lesser-skilled IT jobs is expected to decline (Figure 15). For instance, jobs for computer engineers, scientists, and systems analysts which typically require at least a four-year college degree, grew from 474,000 in 1990 to 874,000 in 1996. By 2006, BLS projects that 1.8 million people will be needed to fill these jobs. The demand for computer programmers, jobs requiring two to four years of college or advanced training, is expected to increase, rising from 548,000 in 1996 to 665,000 in 2006. On the other hand, lesser-skilled jobs like computer operators and duplicating machine operators, which only require a high school diploma, are expected to decline from 481,000 in 1996 to 342,000 in 2006.

Lower skilled IT workers include computer and office machine operators.  Source: ESA estimates based on BLS data  The Internet is also driving demand for workers with IT skills. Workers are needed to design Web pages, create graphics, code documents in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and program in Internet languages such as Java and C++. Webmasters responsible for the design, development, operation, and maintenance of Web sites earn starting salaries between $35,000 and $50,000; highly experienced webmasters earn $100,000 or more. Web developers, responsible for the actual creation of the Web site, are reported to earn a median salary of $55,000. On the lower end of the skill level in Internet jobs, customer service representatives that work for Internet Service Providers earn from $14,000 to $17,000 per year and up to $35,000 depending on experience.16 The demand for computer engineers, scientists, systems analysts, and computer programmers is expected to continue to increase through 2006. Despite this growth and anticipated demand, the number of U.S. graduates with a bachelor's degree in computer science declined by 40 percent A1 - 15   between 1986 and 1994. However, a bachelor's degree in computer science is not the only path of entry into an IT occupation. Other related academic fields, such as computer engineering and business information systems, can supply workers in these categories and even graduates in many non-science and engineering fields are employed in IT-related occupations. At the same time demand for workers to fill IT-specific jobs is increasing, workers in a variety of non-IT occupations find themselves using computers and computerized devicesPCs, CAD, and CAM machines, computerized measuring and analytical instruments, testing and diagnostic equipmentto perform their jobs. Somewhat dated statistics (1993) show that nearly half of all workers regularly use a computer in their jobs, with even higher usage among more highly-skilled and educated workers.17 Preparing students and workers to meet current and future labor market demand will require a new and determined commitment to education and training in mathematics and science.

In this definition, IT industries produce, process, or transmit information goods and services as either intermediate demand (inputs to production to other industries) or as final products to consumption, investment, government purchases, or exports.18 Other industries were considered to be IT industries since they provide the necessary infrastructure (communications) for the Internet to operate (Table 4). IT industries are classified (and defined) according to the 1987 SIC manual, published by the Office of Management and Budget. IT industries are further separated into categories of Hardware, Software and Services, and Communications. Hardware industries include computers and equipment, including their wholesale and retail sales, office machines, semiconductors, some other electronic component industries, and industries that produce measurement and laboratory analytical instruments. Wholesale sales of computers and equipment was included to capture the sales by manufacturers through their branch offices, accounted for by the Census as a wholesale sale. These sales were considered to be closely aligned with a manufacturer's sale; excluding their sale would result in a serious undercount. Retail sales were included in order to capture all other sales of computers. Software and services industries include those that provide prepackaged software and services associated with computers. There is some concern that direct sales of software are underestimated because government data only detail the sales of prepackaged software for microcomputers. The cost of software loaded onto a mainframe computer for business or government use, therefore, may not be captured. A much greater problem exists with respect to international trade of software. In this case, the software cost reported to the Customs Bureau as an import might include only the cost of the cassette or CD-ROM. Once in the U.S., the software could be copied and resold any number of times. The same might be true for a U.S. manufacturer with foreign affiliates. In this case, the software could be developed in the U.S. and a single copy sent to their foreign affiliate and copied overseas to be used in their computer production. Accounting for these transactions is difficult to do, if not impossible. Communications equipment and services industries were selected as IT industries since they provide the ""infrastructure"" that allows the connections between computers and servers that enable electronic commerce and provide the highways for access and movement. Despite the attempt to cleanly designate the IT sector, there will always be some subjectivity with the data that are used to measure it. As IT goods and services are increasingly incorporated into non-IT goods and services, it is difficult to draw hard-and-fast boundaries. For instance, semiconductors are used in computers, but they are also used in automobiles, home appliances, and a variety of other goods. Because they provide computing power and intelligence to all of these products, we have included the entire semiconductor industry as IT. Similarly, the majority A1 - 18   of revenue by the telecommunications industry is still generated by traditional telephone service. Over time, however, virtually all IT investment will be part of interlinked communication systems.  Table 4.

Due to the difficulty in isolating IT, no standard definition exists. Different governmental and private sector bodies propose their own definitions, sometimes breaking out IT as a separate sector, sometimes including it as part of a set of industries that they consider to be high-tech. A1 - 19   For example, BEA assesses high-technology industries. In addition to computer equipment and communications industries, their high-tech list includes those that produce an array of hardware for the national defense (military aircraft, aircraft engines, and electronics). The Bureau of the Census has just launched the use of the new industry classification system, called the North American Industry Classification (NAICS)replacing the current SIC systemin their 1997 Economic Census. The NAICS provides for a new Information Sector, but its focus is primarily on industries that produce information and not hardware items such as computers or communications equipment. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Statistical Panel of the Committee on Information, Computers, and Communications Policy, in August 1997, proposed a draft definition of the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) sector.19 Industry associations have also produced varying definitions of IT and high-tech industries, but their selection was in part driven by their membership. For example, the American Electronics Association (AEA) provides an extensive list of industries that they consider as High Technology, inclusive of industries considered to be IT.20 The Information Technology Institute's (ITI) list of IT industries includes a number of those that are also considered IT by the AEA, except for electronic component industries. Many of the industries included in these various definitions of IT are common. A number are not (Table 5).  A1 - 20   Table 5.

Output of IT industries is measured in terms of value added. Value added is equal to total receipts (also known as sales or revenues) and other operating income less purchases of intermediate goods and services from other industries (adjusted for salable inventories) and imports minus purchased operating expenses. Value added can be thought of more directly; i.e., value added is the sum of all earned income of an industry including its salaries and wages, benefits, business taxes, and profits. Value added can be added across industries to produce an aggregate measurement of the IT sector. The value added of all industries is equal to the Gross Domestic Income (GDI). This method of estimating these industries' share of the economy is commonly called an ""income"" side approach. A ""product"" side approach could be used as an alternative. The product side approach adds final expenditures (final demand) on commodities produced by industries by major segments of the economy--consumption, investment, net exports, and government. Final demand across all industries is equal to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Theoretically, the estimates from the income and the product sides should be the same. In practice, they are not and the difference between GDI and GDP is officially known as the ""statistical discrepancy.""21 The income, rather than the product, side approach was used in this analysis since the industry detail (shown in Table 4) available using government value added data exceeds the detail of the available data on commodities. Also, the commodity data are not consistently reported across all components of GDP. The income side approach based on industry data, therefore, allows for more precision in measuring industries. On the other hand, the income side approach forces the analyst to make a number of assumptions about the data, detailed in the next section on value added. The IT workforce is defined as all employees in IT industries and all workers in IT-related occupations, across all industries and government. Care was taken to not double count workers with IT-related occupations working in IT industries. IT employment is presented in two parts-(1) total employment across IT industries and (2) total employment in occupations that are considered to be IT-related. Data are based on historical reporting and projections made by the BLS. The occupations chosen as IT-related were selected in consultation with BLS and other agencies (Table 6).  A1 - 22   Table 6.

The specific sources of data that follow are from the Department of Commerce's Bureau of the Census or BEA.22 The following is a description of the data and estimates made to derive value added for the (1) manufacturing IT industries, (2) the software and services IT industries, (3) the communications services IT industries, (4) the wholesale trade of computer equipment and software, and (5) the retail trade of computer equipment and software (Table 7). Value added for IT manufacturing industries, including the hardware and communications equipment IT industries were taken directly from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) and the 1992 Census of Manufacturers (COM) published by the Bureau of the Census. The latest published ASM is for 1995. The 1996 ASM will be available in 1998. The next COM will be for 1997 and will include industries classified according to the NAICS definitions. Value added of the hardware IT sector increased from $116.1 billion in 1990 to $183.6 billion in 1995. The IT communications equipment sector increased from $24.5 billion in 1990 to $39.9 billion in 1995. Value added for the software and services IT industries was derived using the Census series  A1 - 23   Table 7.

Note: Value added estimates from various sources (see text) *GDP as measured by earned income (Gross Domestic Income)   on services--Current Business Report Service Annual Survey (latest available for 1995) and the 1992 Census of Service Industries. The Service Annual Survey provides estimated receipts for taxable firms by 4-digit SIC industries. The value added of the software and services IT sector increased from $59.7 billion in 1990 to $102.6 billion in 1995. Value added for software and services is not separately reported so that estimates of value added are derived using the methodology outlined below: Calculating Receipts Less Cost of Goods Sold--The first part of the value added calculation (receipts less cost of goods sold) for software and services IT industries was derived using the 1990-1995 annual total receipts by industry from the Service Annual Survey and subtracting cost of goods sold based on the proportion of cost of goods sold to receipts that existed in 1992. The 1992 Census of Services Industries provides a Subject Series called Sources of Receipts and Revenue from which the cost of goods sold can be computed. For the software and services IT industries, the cost of goods sold is mostly negligible; i.e., the cost of goods sold for most of these industries was less than 2.0 percent in 1992. Therefore, for these industries, cost of goods sold were made equal to zero. However, there were three software and services IT industries where the cost of goods sold were significant; i.e., exceeded 2.0 percent. They are (1) the computer rental and leasing industry (SIC 7377) where cost of goods sold in 1992 was equal to 8.6 percent of total receipts, (2) the computer maintenance and repair industry (SIC 7378) was 7.6 percent, and (3) the computer services, not elsewhere classified, industry (SIC 7379) was 2.4 percent. Goods sold from these computer services sectors are primarily computers and computer equipment. Subtracting Purchased Operating Expenses--The 1992 Census of Service Industries series includes another Subject Series called Capital Expenditures, Depreciable Assets, and Operating Expenses. This report lists operating expenses by type and kind of business for payroll, benefits, taxes, depreciation and amortization charges, lease and rental payments, telephone and other purchased communications, purchased utilities, purchased office supplies, and advertising services for 1992. Purchased operating expenses include the depreciation charges, utilities, office supplies, and advertising services. Payroll, benefits, and taxes represent value added. Thus the second part of the value added calculation can be made by using the proportion of purchased operating expenses to total receipts for software and services IT industries that existed in 1992 to subtract from the total receipts less cost of goods sold from 1990 through 1995. Specifically, the proportion of value added to total receipts for software and services IT industries in 1992 are as follows: computer programming services (SIC 7371), 72.6 percent; prepackaged software, (SIC 7372), 66.8 percent; computer A1 - 25   integrated systems design (SIC 7373), 75.8 percent; computer processing and data preparation (SIC 7374), 59.8 percent; information retrieval services (SIC 7375), 71.3 percent; computer services management (SIC 7376), 71.3 percent; computer rental and leasing (SIC 7376), 62.4 percent; computer maintenance and repair (SIC 7378), 63.4 percent, and computer related services, nec (SIC 7379), 68.8 percent. Value added used for the IT communications services industries were taken directly from BEA's Gross Product Originating (GPO) by industry time series instead of using a calculated value added from the Census data. The value added of the communications services sector increased from $146.7 billion in 1990 to $191.6 billion in 1995. The reasons for using the BEA data are: (1) the BEA industries and the list of industries used in the study matched exactly,23 (2) the difference from the published BEA value added and the calculated estimates of value added from the revenue and operating expense data from the Bureau of the Census Annual Survey of Communications Services was less than one percent for each year between 1990 and 1995, and (3) the BEA data were published; the derived value added data from Census were not. It was felt that a published number prevails over a computed number and that value added should, theoretically, equal GPO. Value added for wholesale trade of computer equipment and software were added to the list of IT industries, as sales from manufacturers' branch offices are counted by the Census as a wholesale sale and not as a part of manufacturers' shipments. Wholesale sales of computers and equipment increased from $33.6 billion in 1990 to $50.8 billion in 1995. Wholesale sales of computer software increased from $1.7 billion in 1990 to $2.6 billion in 1995. The primary source for these data is the Bureau of the Census Current Business Report's Annual Benchmark Report for Wholesale Trade, January 1987 Through February 1997. In this report, gross margins (sales less cost of goods sold) by wholesale industries at the aggregate level are reported. Thus, the first part of the value added calculation (sales less cost of goods sold) is reported directly as gross margins. To take the aggregate reporting to the 4-digit SIC detail needed for this report, additional computations were made: Computing Gross Margins at 4-Digit SIC Level The annual benchmark report provides gross margins for 3-digit SIC industries only. For purposes of this report, it was necessary to isolate SIC 5045, Wholesale sales of computer equipment and software, which is a subset of SIC 504, Wholesale sales of professional & commercial equipment and supplies. To achieve this, the 1992 Economic Census of Wholesale Trade was used to derive estimates for value added at the 4-digit SIC level (SIC 5045) and incorporate branch office sales. In this report, data at the 4-digit SIC level are provided that include sales and purchased operating expenses of all the wholesale sales of computer equipment A1 - 26   and software--from merchant wholesalers, from manufacturers' sales from branch offices, and from wholesale sales from agents, brokers, and commission merchants. In 1992, manufacturer sales of computer equipment and software from their branch offices represented 53 percent of all wholesale sales. These sales are unreported in the annual data. The 1992 benchmark report also provides separate categories of SIC 5045--wholesale sales of computer equipment and wholesale sales of computer software. Value added at the 4-digit level is calculated using the same proportions of (1) merchant wholesaler sales to manufacturer branch offices' sales over the period and (2) purchased operating expenses (costs of goods sold are already accounted for in the gross margin data) to sales. Gross margin data at the 3-digit level from the annual report are used as controls to derive the 4-digit value added estimates. Value added for retail trade of computer equipment and software (SIC 5734) were derived in almost the same way as the wholesale estimates. Retail sales of computers and equipment increased from $1.9 billion in 1990 to $2.5 billion by 1995. Retail sales of computer software increased from $93.8 million in 1990 to $126.1 million by 1995. In this case, the Bureau of the Census Annual Benchmark Report for Retail Trade: January 1987 Through December 1996 was used to obtain total sales and gross margins by the aggregate industry category--a combination of SICs 5722, 31, 34 (radio, television and computer stores). The 1992 Census of Retail Trade was then used to disaggregate the aggregate sector into its parts and provide operating expenses of the industry. The 1992 report also provides sales data on both retail sales of computers equipment and software. The proportions developed for 1992 were then applied to the controls in the remaining years to provide estimates of retail sales at the 4-digit level, much the same way used to derive the estimates of value added for the wholesale IT industries. The sum of the value added of all the IT industries compared to total nominal GDP24 was used to compute the IT share of the economy. The nominal share of the economy and contribution to nominal economic growth are computed based on GDP, rather than GDI, although GDI would be a more appropriate measure. This was done since (1) GDP is a far more familiar concept than GDI, (2) GDP is thought to be a more accurate measure of the economy, and (3) the difference between the GDP and GDI IT industry share and contribution to growth are small. In 1996, if IT value added were based on GDI, the share of the economy would have been 7.1 percent rather than 7.4 percent (GDP calculation) and the IT contribution to the growth of the economy would have been 13.4 percent instead of 14.5 percent (GDP calculation). The IT contribution to annual economic growth was calculated simply as the proportion of the annual change in IT industries' total value added over the total annual change in GDP. In 1990, value added of the IT sector was $347.0 billion or 6.0 percent of total GDP. In 1995, value added of the IT sector was $517.7 billion, accounting for 7.1 percent of total GDP, and 16.1 A1 - 27   percent of total economic growth. VALUE ADDED OF IT INDUSTRIES, ESTIMATES FOR 1996-98 In order to provide for more recent measurement of value added for IT industries, estimates were made based on projections of industry shipments provided in the ""U.S. Industry and Trade Outlook, `98"" (Outlook) jointly published by the Department of Commerce and DRI/McGrawHill. For each of the IT industries, estimates of shipments (sales), revenue, or receipts were taken directly or derived (for some IT industries, aggregate industry projections needed to be disaggregated to the IT level of industry detail) from the Outlook report. To arrive at the value added for the IT industries for 1996 through 1998, the projected shipments (from the Outlook) were multiplied by the average ratio of value added to either sales, revenue, or receipts, from the 1990 through 1995 value added data. In 1996, total value added of the IT sector was $571.1 billion, 7.5 percent of total GDP, and accounted for $14.6 percent of economic growth. In 1998, it is estimated that total value added of the IT sector will be $682.6 billion, account for 8.2 percent of total GDP, and account for 14.9 percent of total economic growth. VALUE ADDED OF IT INDUSTRIES IN REAL 1992 CHAIN WEIGHTED DOLLARS Nominal value added for IT industries were deflated to constant 1992 chain weighted dollars by using deflators calculated from BEA's published time series on GPO by industry (Table 8). Deflators were calculated by dividing the nominal dollar GPO by the constant dollar GPO for the appropriate industries in the IT sector. Deflators for computer manufacturing were provided separately. Nominal dollar value added of computer manufacturing was deflated using BEA's quality-adjusted ""hedonic"" regression deflators.

Instead, the wholesale trade and retail trade implicit deflators were used since these industries consist primarily of the wholesale and retail distribution network. The BEA also publishes quality-adjusted price indexes for semiconductors.25 However, to be conservative, the implicit GPO deflator for ""Electronic and other Electric Equipment"" was used for semiconductors. The following implicit GPO deflators were also used for the remaining IT industries: communications services deflator for the communications services industries; the electronic and electric equipment deflator for the communications equipment industries; the business services deflator for the software and services industries; the electronic and other electric equipment deflator for the IT electronics components industries; and the instruments and related products deflator for the IT instrument industries. IT contribution to real economic growth was computed using a methodology described in detail in BEA's May 1997 Survey of Current Business article called ""BEA's Chain Indexes, Time Series, and Measures of Long-Term Economic Growth"" by J. Steven Landefeld and Robert P. Parker. The box on page 63 provides a ""Note on Computing Alternative Chained Dollar Indexes and Contributions to Growth."" The methodology to compute real chain weighted dollar contribution to economic growth is not the same straight forward process used in determining contribution to growth for nominal dollars or if the real dollars would have been fixed. Basically, the chain-type weights require that growth from year-to-year for each of the IT industries' value added be rebased by moving the nominal value added for each of the industries by the change in the real value added. This basically sets each of the years as the base, or equal to 100, so that the difference between the nominal base and the calculated change is equal to the growth of IT industries. The rebased growth of IT industries was calculated in two ways and then averaged. First, growth for one year, say 1995, is based on the change in real growth (from the rebased nominal for 1995) to the next year, 1996. In this study, this is called the ""next year"" method. The changes in real growth from year-to-year, rebasing coefficients, are multiplied by the nominal value added (rebased so that each year equals 100.0) for each of the IT industries. The change from the nominal to the rebased change is the calculated change in the real. Second, growth for 1995 is also calculated on the change in real growth (again from the rebased nominal 1995) from the prior year, 1994. In this study, this is called the ""prior year"" method. The change in IT industries for both of these methods are averaged to derive a rebased change in IT industries for each of the years (Table 9). The contribution to real economic growth is then calculated as the total average change in the rebased IT industries over the annual change in real GDI (Table 10).

Real value added for IT industries for 1997 was estimated based on the relationship between nominal IT and calculated real IT for 1996. IT CONTRIBUTION TO LOWERING INFLATION Since GDI was used in this analysis to calculate the contribution to real economic growth, overall inflation was calculated from the implicit price deflator for GDI; i.e., an overall price index calculated as nominal GDI over real GDI (Table 11). The year-to-year change in the index is the annual change index. Nominal and real value added of IT industries are GDI. The index and the year-to-year change in the index inflation rate, using the implicit deflator for GDI, without in overall prices as measured by the subtracted from total nominal and real are recalculated to determine the overall the value added of IT industries.

BEA defines information processing equipment (IT equipment) to include: office, computing, and accounting machinery, communications equipment, photocopy and related equipment, and instruments. Estimates of IT equipment spending as a share of total business equipment spending were derived from inflation-adjusted investment expenditures on the above assets. BEA recently developed a new, chain-weighted deflation method which is preferable to the fixed-weighted deflators previously used because they allow for changes in prices and output A1 - 33   composition over time.26 However, chain-weighted estimates are not additive and it would be misleading to use the IT capital spending share to approximate a non-IT capital spending share. Also, BEA warns that chain-weighted estimates may lose some accuracy as one moves away from the base period and thus, may not be suitable for time series analysis. Industries that were considered heavy users of IT equipment were determined in two waysthe level of overall use of IT equipment relative to total equipment use and their IT investment per employee. (Tables 12 and 13) Fifty-three industries (exc. farming) were ranked according to both measures of IT intensity and the top 15 industries were designated as ""major users"" of information technology. Net capital stock is the cumulative value of past gross investment less the cumulative value of past depreciation. Total net capital stock of equipment includes non-IT industrial equipment, transportation equipment, etc. in $1987. Investment in IT equipment per employee includes annual purchases of IT equipment ($1987) divided by the number of workers in each industry. The most recent investment and net capital stock data by industry and by asset type are for 1994. BEA expects to release data for 1995 and 1996 in the spring of 1998. EMPLOYMENT TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS The employment numbers used in this analysis are from the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey, conducted monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in conjunction with state employment security agencies (Table 14). Private employment includes all full and part-time employees except those in the agricultural and government sectors. These data can be found at the BLS website (http://www.bls.gov). BLS also collects employment data through the Covered Employment and Wages (ES202) program, which are published annually in Employment and Wages, Annual Averages. When CES employment figures were not available at the necessary level of detail (4-digit SIC level), employment levels were estimated by applying the 4-digit SIC level employment distribution of the ES202 numbers to the aggregate (3-digit SIC level) CES numbers. When CES employment numbers were not available at the 3-digit SIC level, ES202 employment numbers were used. BLS publishes employment projections by industry to 2006, but mainly at the 2- and 3-digit SIC levels. Historical employment trends (1990 to 1996) were used to extrapolate employment demand of 4-digit industries to 2006. Five entire 2- or 3-digit industries were included among our list of IT industries -- computer and office equipment (357), electronic components and accessories (367), communications equipment (366), communications services (48), and computer and data processing services (737). For these industries, the projected employment levels were scaled to match officially published BLS projections. For the remaining industries, the unadjusted extrapolated employment estimates were used.

a union or an employee association contract.        NOTE:  Data for 2001 have been revised to reflect the introduction of Census 2000-based population controls.  In addition,      data on ""represented by unions"" incorporate a minor change to the allocation procedure for that item.  The change in      procedure had a small effect on the estimates.  Data refer to the sole or principal job of full- and part-time workers.       Excluded are all self-employed workers regardless of whether or not their businesses are incorporated.

These changes         were initiated by the Office of Management and Budget in 1997 and were         intended to capture the diversity of people in our nation.         Unfortunately, it also creates numerous problems when researchers try to         make comparisons across time.           A consortium of Federal agencies, which         includes the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Department         of Justice (DOJ), Department of Labor (DOL), and the Office of Personnel         Management (OPM) has developed an agreement with the US Census Bureau to         construct a special EEO file from Census 2000. The Bureau’s Housing         and Household Economics Statistics (HHES) programming staff will be         responsible for creating the specified EEO file. It will contain the         same type of information as did comparable files from the 1970, 1980 and         1990 censuses. However, the file is not expected to be available until         the spring of 2003.           The primary variables on the Census         2000 EEO File will be race and ethnicity cross-tabulated by other         variables, such as detailed occupation, occupational groups, sex,         workplace geography, residence geography, education, age, and industry.         The data will be available to the public by mutual agreement between the         Federal Consortium and the Bureau in a form that has yet to be         determined, such as via CDs or the Internet. Depending on the amount of         detail within a table, the information for counties and/or places will         only be provided for those with 50,000 or more.

EST Media contact:                691-5902     Tuesday, February 25, 2003                              UNION MEMBERS IN 2002      In 2002, 13.2 percent of wage and salary workers were union members, down  from 13.4 percent (as revised) in 2001, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau  of Labor Statistics reported today.  The number of persons belonging to a  union fell by 280,000 over the year to 16.1 million in 2002.  The union mem- bership rate has steadily declined from a high of 20.1 percent in 1983, the  first year for which comparable union data are available.  Some highlights  from the 2002 data are:       --Men were more likely to be union members than women.      --The union membership rate for blacks was unchanged and remained higher     than the rates for either whites or Hispanics.         --Nearly 4 in 10 government workers were union members in 2002, compared     with less than 1 in 10 workers in private-sector industries.  The trans-     portation industry had the highest private-sector rate of unionization.      --Nearly two-fifths of workers in protective service occupations were     union members in 2002.  Protective service occupations include fire-     fighters and police officers.  This group has had the highest union      membership rate of any broad occupation group in every year since 1983.  Membership by Industry and Occupation        In 2002, workers in the public sector had a union membership rate over four times that of private-sector employees, 37.5 percent compared with  8.5 percent.  The unionization rate for government workers has held steady since 1983.  The rate for private industry workers has fallen by nearly half over the same time period.  Within government, local government workers had the highest union membership rate, 42.8 percent.  This group includes the heavily unionized occupations of teachers, police officers, and firefighters.  Among private industries, transportation had the high- est union membership rate, at 23.8 percent.  Construction and durable goods manufacturing also had higher-than-average rates, at 17.2 percent and  15.6 percent, respectively.  The industry with the lowest unionization rate  in 2002 was finance, insurance, and real estate--1.9 percent.  (See table 3.)        ------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                Changes in Union Membership Estimates                   |  |                                                                        |  |   Estimates for 2001 and 2002 presented in this release are based on   |  | Census 2000 population controls.  Consequently, the estimates for      |  | 2001 appearing in this release may differ from those published earlier,|  | which were based on population controls derived from the 1990 census.  |  | In addition, the data on ""represented by unions"" incorporate a minor   |  | change to the allocation procedure for that item.  The change in proce-|  | dure had a small effect on the estimates.  Estimates for 2001 and 2002 |  | are not strictly comparable with estimates for earlier years.  For fur-|  | ther information on these changes, see the Technical Note.             |   ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                       - 2 -     Among occupational groups, protective service workers continued to have the highest unionization rate in 2002, at 37.0 percent.  Precision produc- tion, craft, and repair workers and operators, fabricators, and laborers also  had higher-than-average union membership rates at 20.7 percent and 19.1 per- cent, respectively.  Workers in these occupations typically are employed in  the highly unionized industries of manufacturing and construction.  Profes- sional specialty workers, a group that includes teachers, also had a higher- than-average union membership rate in 2002, at 19.2 percent.  Sales occupa- tions had the lowest unionization rate--3.6 percent.  (See table 3.)     Demographic Characteristics of Union Members        In 2002, union membership rates were higher for men (14.7 percent) than for women (11.6 percent).  The union membership rate for men fell from  15.0 percent in 2001, while the rate for women was unchanged.  The gap be- tween men's and women's rates has narrowed considerably since 1983, when  the rate for men was 10 percentage points higher than the rate for women.        Blacks were more likely to be union members (16.9 percent) than either whites (12.8 percent) or Hispanics (10.5 percent).  Black men had the highest  unionization rate (18.2 percent) among the major demographic groups, and  Hispanic women and white women had the lowest rates, 9.8 percent and 10.9 per- cent, respectively.  Union membership rates were highest among workers be- tween the ages of 45 to 54 years.  Full-time workers were more than twice  as likely as part-time workers to be union members.  (See table 1.)     Union Representation of Nonmembers        About 1.7 million wage and salary workers were represented by a union on their main job in 2002, while not being union members themselves.  (See table 1.)  Over half of these workers were employed in government and about 20 percent worked in the services industry.  (See table 3.)     Earnings        In 2002, full-time wage and salary workers who were union members had median usual weekly earnings of $740, compared with a median of $587 for wage and salary workers who were not represented by unions.  (See table 2.) The difference reflects a variety of influences in addition to coverage by a collective bargaining agreement, including variations in the distributions  of union members and nonunion employees by occupation, industry, firm size,  or geographic region.  (For a discussion of the problem of differentiating  between the influence of unionization status and the influence of other worker  characteristics on employee earnings, see ""Measuring union-nonunion earnings  differences,"" Monthly Labor Review, June 1990.)     Union Membership by State     Union membership rates in many states also declined slightly in 2002, with 33 states and the District of Columbia reporting lower membership rates and 15 states registering increases.  Two states reported no change                                    - 3 -  in their union membership rates from 2001 to 2002.  Twenty-eight states had union membership rates below that of the U.S., while 21 states and the District of Columbia had higher rates.  Once again, all states in the East North Central, Middle Atlantic, and Pacific divisions had union membership rates above the national average of 13.2 percent, while all states in the East South Central and West South Central divisions had rates below it. (See table 5.)        Four states had union membership rates over 20.0 percent in 2002--New York (25.3 percent), Hawaii (24.4 percent), Alaska (24.3 percent), and Michigan (21.1 percent).  This is the same rank order as in 2001.  All  four states have had rates above 20.0 percent every year since data became regularly available in 1995.  North Carolina and South Carolina also con- tinued to report the lowest union membership rates, 3.2 percent and  4.9 percent, respectively.  These two states have had the lowest union  membership rates each year since the state series became available.        The largest numbers of union members lived in California (2.5 million), New York (2.0 million), and Illinois (1.1 million).  Over half (8.1 million)  of the 16.1 million union members in the U.S. lived in six states, although  these states accounted for only 35 percent of wage and salary employment  nationally.        The number of union members in a state depends on both its population size and union membership rate.  Texas (the second most populous state) had less than one-fourth as many union members as New York (the third largest), despite having nearly 1.0 million more wage and salary employees.  Similarly,  Florida (the fourth largest state) and Indiana (the fourteenth) had virtually  the same number of union members, even though Florida's wage and salary em- ployment level was more than double that of Indiana.
