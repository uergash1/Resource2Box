This touched off a uranium boom, particularly on the Colorado Plateau. In southern Utah's Capitol Reef National Park, for example, the Department of the Interior attempted to prevent uranium mining and exploration, but the AEC cited national security as warranting full development of domestic uranium sources and pushed for prospecting in any potential uranium-bearing formations within public lands. In February 1952 a special use permit was signed between the AEC and the Park Service that opened Capitol Reef's lands to uranium miners. [ 1500 ] While no such action was taken at Pipe Spring National Monument, a considerable amount of exploration for uranium and oil took place on surrounding lands, including some on the Kaibab Indian Reservation.    During September 1952, Heaton began to report that a number of people camping on the monument were prospectors for oil and minerals: ""Government men out looking for oil on Indian Reservation and will start drilling in a few weeks."" [ 1501 ] That month 46 people camped for one or more nights at the monument, with a number of prospectors using the campgrounds as a base for their activities. It was reported at the Zion staff meeting in early November that drilling on the reservation by oil companies was to begin as soon as equipment could be set up. In March 1953 more oil prospectors were conducting oil exploration on the reservation.    Prospecting activity noticeably increased from June through October 1954, with concomitant use of the monument's campground. [ 1502 ] In early July Heaton reported,       There have also been a lot of prospectors going and coming through the monument hunting for that rare metal, Uranium. Instead of traveling with the lowly donkey (the Desert Nightingale) and pick and shovel, they have the high-powered gas wagons and geiger counters. Several hundred acres have been staked to the west and southwest of the monument. [ 1503 ]       In August 1954 Heaton reported, ""More oil and uranium activities starting in the area."" [ 1504 ] Heaton reported that mining and drilling had begun in the area ""and the roads are kept busy with workmen driving to and from their work."" [ 1505 ] In early September he wrote, ""Quite a large outfit for core drill for uranium passed, going west. Report 40 or 60 300-foot holes are to be drilled."" [ 1506 ] In October Heaton wrote, ""Uranium drillers are here.    Pulled in last night. [They are] working some 10 miles to the west of the monument."" [ 1507 ] There were no reports of rich finds. Several oil companies were trying to close leases on private lands so that they could begin drilling that winter. Heaton also reported a new user of Pipe Spring water: ""Uranium mines are hauling quite a bit of water from the monument to use in their drilling operation."" [ 1508 ] Area mining operations closed down over the winter of 1954-1955, except for a few claims staked by private individuals. In January 1955 Heaton reported, ""The Mineral Engineering Company of Pueblo, Colorado is doing some core drilling for uranium on the cedar ridge 10 miles west of the monument. There was some drilling before but could not make any good test because of moisture and water in the ground at about 60 to 80 feet.""

For Immediate Release: October 25, 2001                CA-610-02-10 Contact:  Doran Sanchez (909) 697-5220; E-MAIL:  dasanche@ca.blm.gov   Public Invited to Help Agencies Develop Boundaries of Proposed Mohave Ground Squirrel Conservation Area   The public is invited to help cities, counties and agencies develop the boundaries of a proposed conservation area for the Mohave ground squirrel, a mammal listed as ""threatened"" by the State of California.   The location of these boundaries will be a critical component of the West Mojave Plan, an interagency program intended to conserve sensitive desert plants and animals while streamlining the time-consuming and expensive process of obtaining permits required by the federal and California endangered species acts.     Maps of the proposed conservation area boundary are now available for public viewing and mark-up at the Ridgecrest City Hall, Indian Wells Valley Water District, Bureau of Land Management Ridgecrest Field Office, California City Hall, Trona Senior Center and Inyo County Planning Department (addresses below).  The maps will be available at those locations until Friday, December 21, 2001.   The Mohave ground squirrel is one of the most important of the nearly 100 species being considered by the plan.  It's range lies wholly within the western Mojave desert, and it is listed as a ""threatened"" mammal by the State of California.  Because it is listed, proponents of commercial and other large-scale projects to be constructed on private lands within the squirrel's range must obtain an ""incidental take permit"" from the State of California, in addition to any other discretionary permits they might require from cities, counties and agencies.  Permit issuance may take months, and may require expensive biological surveys and land purchases.  Moreover, the protective biological measures imposed as a condition of permit issuance are developed for each project in isolation, and may be inconsistent with those required by other permits.  This limits their effectiveness, and precludes a ""big picture"" approach.   The West Mojave Plan is intended to address both of these issues.  Time-consuming case-by-case permits will be replaced by streamlined conservation measures developed in advance, and which conform to a regional conservation strategy designed by leading biologists to conserve Mojave ground squirrel populations and habitat.  Permit applicants will be provided with business planning certainty: they will know, in advance, the conservation measures that will be required of them, and could plan for costs and rely on swift permit approval.  This will enable cities and counties to be more competitive in their efforts to attract development to the region.  ""If we do our job correctly, we will preserve our desert resources and, at the same time, provide a stimulus to the regional economy,"" said project manager Bill Haigh.  ""That's the reason cities and counties throughout the western Mojave desert are joining state and federal agencies to prepare the plan.""     At the heart of this program is the establishment of a conservation area for the Mojave ground squirrel, which will protect its habitat and help reverse population declines.  A relatively higher development fee will be required of new projects to be located on public and private lands within the conservation area, and other protective measures will be applied.  A motorized vehicle access network will be developed which is designed to provide access to public lands and recreational areas in a manner compatible with the conservation of the squirrel.  Outside of the conservation area, the existing requirement for biological surveys of private lands requirement will be lifted, and the construction of single family residences will be exempted from the incidental take permit requirements.   It is important to draw the boundary lines of the Mohave ground squirrel conservation area with care.  Therefore, public input is being solicited throughout the West Mojave planning process to ensure that the boundary reflects both biological and local community needs.  The next two months are the first step in this process; after a proposal is developed, formal public meetings will be held late this winter to review the conservation area boundaries and other aspects of the West Mojave Plan.  Additional public meetings will be held in the summer of 2002 after the draft environmental impact report and statement is released for public review.

The exploratory period began in 1850 when Capt. Howard Stansbury, while on a survey of the Great Salt Lake for the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, discovered evidence of ""petroliem"" along the northern shore of the lake. During the next forty years Utah residents and visitors found other signs of oil in various parts of the region.   Before 1890, gold prospectors traveling down the San Juan River in southeastern Utah noticed oil seeps along the river's steep embankments. In that same period two Salt Lake City businessmen found oil dripping from the crevices of rocks on the Green River, and ranchers and other residents of the Uinta Basin came across similar occurrences near Vernal. In 1891 the Utah Oil Company, whose incorporators included Simon Bamberger—later to be governor of Utah—and C. J. Millis, sank a shallow well near Green River, Utah. Not finding any oil, the Utah Oil Company abandoned its well after drilling to a depth of 1,000 feet. During the remainder of the 1890s oil and gas prospectors sank approximately twenty-five wells in various parts of the state.   In 1901 Anthony Lucas's fabulous petroleum discovery at Spindletop, Texas, encouraged Utahns to renew their interest in the state's oil potential. A somewhat frenzied increase in the formation of petroleum companies and the leasing of promising oil properties followed, and the Salt Lake Tribune proclaimed in December 1901 that an ""oil era"" was at hand for Utah. Two years later the state coal mine inspector supported the Tribune's claim by noting the existence of thirty-five oil companies in Utah and the drilling of two wells.   Early Oil Drilling   Southern Utah became the focal point of oil field activities in 1907. Early that year Pat Holohan, a Nevada miner, found outcroppings of oil sand near Virgin City in Washington County and quickly drilled two wells. Twelve different companies soon put down fourteen wells in the region. Meanwhile, a former gold prospector named E. L. Goodridge was drilling a well at Mexican Hat on the San Juan River in San Juan County. In March 1908 Goodridge produced a gusher, and by the end of 1909 approximately seven oil companies had started work on no less than twenty-five wells near Mexican Hat. Neither Virgin City nor Mexican Hat ever became major oil-producing fields, but both areas produced enough oil to supply small local refineries that operated intermittently for many years.   Oil men drilled more than eighty wells in Utah from 1907 through 1912. In addition, John C. Howard incorporated the Utah Oil Refining Company and completed the construction of a refinery at the northern edge of Salt Lake City in 1909. After 1912, however, the state's oil industry went into a slump from which it did not totally recover until 1922.   The prospect of a major petroleum find nevertheless continued to lure a few explorers, and from 1916 to 1921 several companies, including such major operators as the Ohio Oil Company and the Midwest Refining Company, drilled a dozen deep test holes. Observing the persistence of these enterprises, one writer concluded in 1925 that their efforts were justified because Utah's structural and surface conditions held ""exceptional promise for oil and gas accumulation.""   During the 1920s petroleum companies increased their exploration efforts throughout Utah. They worked over areas previously examined and also initiated drilling projects in new locations such as Salt Lake City itself, where one company drilled a well at the north end of Redwood Road while a second firm sunk a well on Highland Drive. Enterprising petroleum operators also tested the Great Salt Lake to a greater extent than had been previously done. The Lakeside Oil Company drilled on the western shore of the lake, and an offshore rig was built on a pier near Rozel Point at the lake's northern tip.   One of the most spectacular ventures of the period was a joint project on the Colorado River near Moab, Utah. The companies involved in this endeavor included the Utah-Southern Oil Company, the Midwest Enterprises Company, and John Howard's Utah Oil Refining Company. Together, these three firms drilled a well called the Frank Shafer No. 1, which hit oil on December 8, 1935. At first the well gushed oil, gas, rock, and sand and gravel hundreds of feet into the air, but very quickly the 84-foot tall wooden derrick caught fire and burned. When the well hit oil the Salt Lake Mining Review hailed it as evidence that Utah had joined the ranks of the ""real petroleum producing states."" The boast was premature, however, because the well's promoters were unable to produce any oil from the venture despite extending the well to a depth of 5,000 feet.   Oil in the Uinta Basin   During the 1920s Earl Douglas, a paleontologist who discovered Dinosaur National Monument, became an eloquent spokesman for Utah's oil industry. His interest in petroleum geology and his scientific investigations in the Uinta Basin convinced him that the region contained a great deal of oil. Throughout the 1920s he called attention to the Uinta Basin by writing journal articles and letters and by visiting financial centers to seek support for drilling projects.   The Great Depression and the first years of World War II dampened enthusiasm for Utah's petroleum potential. Experiencing the worst slowdown in drilling since the World War I period, Utah oil promoters drilled only 143 wells from 1930 through 1944. In 1939 only three wells were sunk, while the total dropped to two in 1942, and no one ventured into any areas which had not already been explored before the Great Depression.   The industry survived this slowdown, and developers continued to drill in Washington County's Virgin oil field where they completed sixty wells before 1944. Standard Oil of California sank two test holes in Emery County, and the Utah-Southern Oil Company remained active in Grand County, even drilling one well to a depth of 6,715 feet. William E. Nevills, who began work in the Mexican Hat oil field in the mid-1920s, enlarged his operations by adding three wells to his string of small producers during the 1930s.   Toward the end of World War II oilmen began to accelerate Utah's petroleum operations once again. From 1945 through 1947 they succeeded in finishing the groundwork necessary to propel the state into a period of commercial oil production. The focal point of their activities was the Uinta Basin where a number of large companies such as Standard Oil of California, Pure, Continental, Gulf, Carter, and Union began to explore more seriously than ever before. Despite the presence of these major firms, the Equity Oil Company, a Utah-based enterprise under the leadership of J. L. Dougan, was the first to find commercial amounts of oil in the Uinta Basin. Dougan was drilling in Ashley Valley on September 18, 1948, when his company tapped a pool of oil that produced 300 barrels a day. During the next seven years major oil companies opened several Uinta Basin fields such as Roosevelt (1949), Red Wash (1951), Walker Hollow (1953), and Bluebell (1955). These fields became a part of two giant oil-producing complexes—Greater Altamont/Bluebell and Greater Red Wash—which ultimately included White River (1961), Cedar Rim (1969), and Altamont (1970).   Greater Aneth Area   During the 1950s other large companies, including Shell, Superior, and Texas, tapped into an oil region in southeastern Utah that overshadowed even the Uinta Basin. The discovery well at Aneth, along the San Juan River east of the old Mexican Hat field, produced 1,704 barrels of oil a day after it hit oil in 1956. Twenty other wells were completed that year, each averaging a daily flow of 800 barrels. The major companies operating in the Aneth region soon discovered other fields, including Ratherford (1956), McElmo Creek (1957), and White Mesa (1957), and together these fields became known as the Greater Aneth Area .

The one exception was the Upper Valley oil field located ten miles southeast of Escalante in Garfield County. In 1964 Tenneco opened the Upper Valley field, and by 1978 there were twenty-six active wells capable of producing a total of one million barrels of petroleum a year.   In 1975 Summit County became an important center for oil development. Part of the Overthrust Belt—a region of highly complex mountain-forming faults, folds, and thrusts—Summit County became the scene of American Quasar's discovery of a field called Pineview, east of Coalville. Within the next five years, Amoco, Chevron, Gulf, Chaplin, and Anschutz Corporation hit prolific amounts of oil and gas in a series of fields that included Lodgepole, Elkhorn Ridge, Anschutz Ranch, and Anschutz Ranch East.   From Howard Stansbury's discovery of ""petroliem"" along the northern shore of the Great Salt Lake in 1851 to the opening of the giant Overthrust Belt fields in Summit County in the late 1970s, the history of Utah's oil industry has been one of slow and intermittent development. The first companies to drill within the state were predominantly small and poorly financed. The majority of wells they drilled (360 out of a total of 550 drilled prior to the Ashley Valley well of 1948) did not even reach a depth of 1,000 feet. None produced the 300 barrels of oil a day that Equity's first well initially yielded. Only gradually did the large petroleum companies enter Utah, and they did not succeed in discovering commercial quantities of oil until after 1948. Most oil development has occurred in the eastern third of Utah, running from the Uinta Mountains to the San Juan River.   In the 140 years since Stansbury's first discovery nearly one hundred and sixty fields have been explored and approximately 900,000,000 barrels of oil produced in Utah (Texas yielded almost that much petroleum in 1947). The number of productive wells in Utah has increased from 225 in 1957 to 875 in 1968 and 1,300 in 1978. While the state's contribution has remained relatively minor, the petroleum industry has become one of Utah's significant commercial enterprises.                                               Previous   |   Table of Contents   |   Utah History To Go   |   Top of Page   |   Next                                                               |  Contact Us   |   Bibliography   |  Site Map  |"

The function of this administrative regulation is to outline the requirements for assigning weights for the horse to race.      Section 1. (1) Weight penalties shall be obligatory. Weight allowance shall be claimed at time of entry and shall not be waived after the posting of entries, except by consent of the stewards.    (2) A horse shall start with only the allowance of weight to which it is entitled at time of starting, regardless of its allowance at time of entry.    (3) Horses incurring weight penalties for a race shall not be entitled to any weight allowance for that race. Horses not entitled to the first weight allowance in a race shall not be entitled to any subsequent allowance specified in the conditions.    (4) Claim of weight allowance to which a horse is not entitled shall not disqualify, unless protest is made in writing and lodged with the stewards at least one (1) hour before post time.    (5) No horse shall incur a weight penalty or be barred from any race for having been placed second or lower in any race. No horse shall be given a weight allowance for failure to finish second or lower in any race.    (6) No horse shall receive allowance of weight nor be relieved of extra weight for having been beaten in one (1) or more races, however, this subsection shall not prohibit maiden allowances or allowances to horse that have not won a race within a specified period or a race of a specified value.    (7) Penalties incurred and allowances due in steeplechase or hurdle races shall not apply to races on the flat, and vice versa.    (8) In determining eligibility, allowances and penalties, the reports, records, and statistics as published in the Daily Racing Form and the monthly chart books, or corresponding official publications of any foreign country, shall be considered official, but may be corrected until forty-five (45) minutes prior to post time of the race.    (9) Horses winning races at unrecognized meetings shall not be penalized for such winnings in races run thereafter under the jurisdiction of the commission. The maiden allowance, however, shall be lost by the winning of a race at any unrecognized meeting.

Consider the case of the U.S. Camel Corps, which hit upon the best solution for Western transportation problems until the arrival of steam locomotives. Freight roads in the arid West crossed waterless stretches of up to ninety miles and often killed the best pack animal, the mule, by the drove. But such a journey was a walk in the park for the famed ""ship of the desert,"" the camel, whose ancestors had evolved in North America.   Quartermaster George Crosman—who later had to figure out how to supply Camp Floyd near Lake Utah—proposed using camels for military transport in the 1830s. When freighting problems grew with the nation, the army imported dromedaries (single-humped Arabians) and lighter Bactrian (two-humped) camels.    In 1857, a former Navy lieutenant, Edward Beale, set out from Texas in command of the U.S. Camel Corps and seventy-five of the animals. Beale's experiment proved camels could pack a ton of goods—four times as much as a prime mule—cover forty miles a day and go ten days without water. They swam across the Colorado River and plowed through three feet of snow. Their drivers boasted that ""camels would get fat where a jackass would starve to death."" Despite Beale's success and then-Secretary of War Jefferson Davis' hope that camel cavalry would frighten violent Apaches into submission, the Civil War put the Camel Corps out of business.   Western entrepreneurs took up the cause and used the beasts to supply remote mining camps. The California and Utah Camel Association bought army surplus camels and sold them in Nevada. San Francisco merchant Otto Esche imported camels from China to establish an express to Great Salt Lake City. He gave up in 1862, but the camels he left in Nevada created such a stir that the state Legislature there banned them from public roads in 1875. Utah desert rat Charles Kelly tracked one of the last surviving pack camels to Grantsville, where it would terrorize local horses but let local children ride it in the early 20th century. The camel, reportedly named ""Jerry,"" even appeared in a Pioneer Day parade with a Mrs. William Carter on his back.   It wasn't that the camels couldn't adapt to the West; the West couldn't adapt to camels. They were not friendly animals, even to fellow camels, and they held grudges. Despite their bad temper and ability to spit the contents of their stomachs with the accuracy of a Kentucky marksman, it was camel stench that helped do them in.   Odor usually was not an issue for Western muleskinners, but the slightest whiff of camel stench played havoc with a mule train. Sometime in 1865, camels stampeded a pack train bound for Missoula and turned the whiskey-bound town's Fourth of July celebration into Montana mud. It was not long before camels were banished from northern mining camps.   Their vast advantage as pack animals notwithstanding, it was America's affection for horses that doomed Western camel caravans.  Camels and their legends long survived among the boomtowns and ranches of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah. A grizzled sideshow camel with a U.S. brand turned up in San Antonio in 1903. Arizona declared camels extinct in 1913, but hunters reported seeing them in the desert around Yuma into the 1950s. And what happened to Jerry? Grantsville folk say only that he wandered off and was not seen again.    _________   For more, see Ellen Baumler's essay in this summer's issue of  Montana  magazine and Hal Schindler's story about ""Jerry"" in the January 2, 1994, edition of  The Salt Lake Tribune.                                                      Previous   |   Table of Contents   |   Utah History To Go   |   Top of Page   |   Next                                                                    |  Contact Us   |   Bibliography   |  Site Map  |"
GX027-86-4091426	"THE GOVERNMENT’S IMPORTATION OF CAMELS:         A    HISTORICAL SKETCH.       By CHARLES C. CARROLL, A. M.,   Editorial Office, Bureau of Animal Industry.       In the early ""fifties"" the Government was  sorely beset with difficulties in protecting the vast frontiers of the country from the ravages of hostile Indians. The transportation of men and supplies over the great reaches of plain, mountain, and desert that stretched between the Mississippi River and the Pacific coast was a problem that swallowed liberal appropriations of money and used up thousands of mules, and was in the end so poorly solved as to chafe and fret the spirits of successive commanders. The roving Indian, with his agile pony that enabled him to make deadly swoops on isolated settlements and escape with ease, was a continual nightmare to the War Department; while the unprotected condition of the Pacific coast, so remote and so painful of access disturbed it no less. Under these circumstances it occurred to the military officials that the use of the camel might at least aid them in performing the difficult duties of protecting the expanding frontier and of keeping open a line of communication between the Mississippi and the coast.    The idea of transplanting this old servant of  mankind from the East into America was not a new one. After the conquest of South America by the Spaniards, it is recorded that Juan de Reineza, a Biscayan, made an attempt to introduce camels into Peru, and toward the end of the sixteenth century camels were seen near the foot of the Andes by Jose Acosta, the Spanish missionary and writer. But the animals were not looked on with favor by the ruling Spaniards, and they dwindled away. In 1701 a vessel, probably a slave trader, brought some camels from Guinea to Virginia, but no record remains of the enterprise except that it failed. In the early times camels were brought also to Jamaica and employed there with success until a small insect, called the ""chiqua,"" so we are told, got into their feet and ended their usefulness.    Maj. George H. Crosman was the first of our  military men to consider and advocate the use of the animal for military purposes in this country, the, transportation difficulties of our stubborn Indian war in Florida convincing him that camels might be used with effect. He made a study of the subject, and about 1836 brought it to the attention of the authorities. His ideas were taken up by Maj. Henry C. Wayne, whose studies on the subject were more complete, and who, as early as 1848, suggested to the War Department and to members of Congress the plan of a Government importation. At about the same time Jefferson Davis, then a United States Senator from Mississippi, was impressed with the desirability of trying the animals, and, as chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs, labored until he left the Senate (in 1851) to secure some practical test by the Government.    The suggestion that camels be used in this  country for travel, for carrying the mails, and for transporting supplies is frequently met with in the newspapers of the ""forties."" These suggestions were made both by tourists from other countries, surprised at the wide extent of our territory, and by observant Americans who had traveled in the Orient and had become acquainted with the universal use of the animal throughout all of the eastern countries.    John Russell Bartlett, who was appointed in  1850 by President Taylor as a commissioner to run the boundary between this country and Mexico, on making the report of his three years' service in that work, strongly urged that camels be employed by the Government in the Southwest. At about this time, too, Prof. George P. Marsh, the philologist and diplomat, who served this country as minister to Turkey and to Italy, published an instructive book on the camel ""considered with reference to his introduction into the United States,"" taking the ground that an energetic attempt to import and use these animals could not but result in success.    In the winter of 1852-53 the proposition was  made to the Committee on Military Affairs in the Senate to authorize the Secretary of War to import 30 camels and 10 dromedaries, together with 10 Arabs to look after them, the proposal being supported by a paper of some length by Mr. George R. Gliddon, the archeologist, who had lived twenty-eight years in the Levant, and was, during eight years of that time, United States consul at Cairo. No measures were taken, however, by that Congress to provide for the importation.    When, in 1853, Jefferson Davis became Secretary        of War in the Cabinet of President Pierce, he came more intimately into contact with the troubles of military transportation in our great West, and resolved to give the camel an opportunity to lessen these difficulties. Major Wayne was asked to prepare some remarks on the subject, to be used as the basis of an appeal to Congress, and he wrote a paper in favor of the project. This paper was liberally drawn upon by the Secretary when he submitted his annual report and recommendations in December, 1853. This report, which was transmitted with the President's message to Congress, aroused a good deal of interest on account of the general belief that something could be accomplished with camels in this country. After reciting the dangers of the slow transportation between the East and the West, and giving in detail the result of an exploration which had been ordered by Congress for he purpose of locating the best route for a proposed transcontinental railway, Secretary Davis said that even such a railway, if built, would but partly remove the difficulty. It would serve to transport troops and to supply depots along the route and at the extremity of the line, but there would still be vast reaches in the interior too remote from its depots materially to feel its effect. ""On the older continents,"" he continued, ""in regions reaching from the torrid to the frozen zones, embracing arid plains and precipitous mountains covered with snow, camels are used with the best results.""  They carry all the commerce of central Asia, and have been used from the mountains of Circassia to the plains of India to transmit dispatches, draw ordnance, and as a substitute for dragoon horses. The example is cited of Napoleon who, by the use of the dromedary in his Egyptian campaigns, subdued the Arabs, a race ""whose habits and country were very similar to those of the mounted Indians of our Western plains."" Mr. Davis, therefore, believed that the dromedary would supply a want in the way of carrying expresses, making reconnaissances, and moving troops rapidly across country; and he recommended that ""necessary provision be made for the introduction of a sufficient number of both varieties of this animal to test its value and adaptation to our country and our service.""    The Secretary's recommendation did not bring  results from that Congress, but it served to encourage those who believed that the camel would prove useful as a beast of burden in the United States, and a company was formed in New York, under a liberal charter from the legislature of that State, with the announced objects of importing and developing a number of camels of different kinds and of employing them in transportation in the West. The organization was styled ""The American Camel Company,"" and its officers were William G. King, Charles W. Webber, and Edward Magouran, the last an enthusiast on the subject.    In his report of December, 1854, Secretary  Davis, after again calling attention to the great sums expended for the transportation of men and supplies said, ""I again invite attention to the advantages to be anticipated from the use of camels and dromedaries for military purposes, and, for reasons set forth in my last annual report, recommend that appropriation be made to introduce a number of the several varieties of this animal to test their adaptation to our country."" The committee that prepared the annual army appropriation bill seemed still skeptical, for the bill came to the Senate with no provision for camels.  In this body an amendment proposed by Senator Shields, of Illinois, was attached, appropriating $30,000 ""to be expended under the direction of the War Department in the purchase and importation of camels and dromedaries to be employed for military purposes."" In the House the proposition had for its sponsors Mr. Phelps, of Missouri, and Mr. James A. McDougall, of California, the latter venturing the prediction that the results of the experiment would ""prove invaluable to the country."" After the usual vicissitudes of amendments to appropriation bills, this proposition became a law in March, 1855.    Secretary Davis lost no time in beginning what       he evidently expected to prove a most successful and far-reaching experiment. In May he directed Major Wayne to proceed to the Levant, stopping in England and France for the purpose of interviewing military men in those countries in regard to the camel and its uses in war. The Secretary of the Navy placed at the disposal of Mr. Davis the storeship  Supply , with her crew, under the command of Lieut. David D. Porter (afterwards Admiral Porter), for the purpose of transporting the animals to this country. It was supposed that the climate of Texas would more nearly furnish such conditions as the camels were accustomed to, and it was accordingly ordered that they should be landed at the most convenient point in that State.    Major Wayne arrived in England in June, 1855.         After inspecting the show camels at the zoological gardens in London and interviewing scientists and military men, he went to Paris, where he pursued the same course, obtaining considerable valuable information. He joined Lieutenant Porter and the  Supply  at Spezzia, Italy, June 24.    In the meantime Lieutenant Porter, having  discharged his cargo of supplies for our Mediterranean squadron, and entering heartily into the spirit of the camel enterprise, had visited the farm of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, near Pisa, where camels had been bred and used for two hundred years. The original stock had come from Egypt, and a sufficient number were kept by the Tuscan ruler to perform the work of 1,000 horses. The animals were found to be performing hard work daily, being forced to carry loads as high as 1,300 pounds each, and toiling from sunrise to sunset. Despite this arduous service, they were badly treated by unappreciative keepers; were forced to obtain their entire subsistence by their own gleanings from nearly barren tracts of land covered with stunted pines and scanty grass, and were never housed, although the climate was hot in summer and cold in winter. The number was limited, but this seemed to be because the Grand Duke did not permit them to be used off his own estates.    In order that they might be able personally to        study the animals, ascertain how the voyage would be likely to affect them, and how the arrangements they had made for embarking and stabling would work, Major Wayne and Lieutenant Porter determined to secure one camel at the first opportunity. They accordingly sailed directly for Tunis, where early in August they bought their first animal. Upon applying for a permit to bring it off, the Bey of Tunis graciously presented to the United States through them two other camels-one, at least, a fine animal, that subsequently became the veteran of the herd and proved himself a sturdy sailor, for he accompanied the ship for over 10,000 miles and was landed in good health on American soil nine months after his embarkation.    The voyage was resumed and Constantinople  reached early in October. From this city the officers, leaving the ship, made a side trip to Balaklava, in the Crimea, to learn what they could about the camels that were used in the Crimean war. The English quartermaster gave them an opportunity of inspecting the animals in the possession of the English, and they gained much information which they regarded as pertinent and valuable. They were told that in the conquest of Sind some 25,000 camels had been used by Gen. Sir Charles Napier, an unusually acute student of transportation problems; and so satisfactory had they proved in the Crimea that the numbers on hand at Balaklava were to be increased for the next campaign. Here the Arabian, or one-humped, camel was used almost exclusively. The average load was 600 pounds, carried 25 to 30 miles a day. A corps of 1,000 men mounted on 500 camels had rendered most effective service under General Napier. It was often marched 70 miles in twelve hours. On arriving at the desired point, the camels were left with the keepers and 500 men operated as infantry, the camels, kneeling and hobbled in a hollow square, even serving as a breastwork in case of necessity.  The Bactrian, or two-humped, camel also was found at Balaklava, but, though stronger and heavier than the Arabian, was not so much used because of the difficulty of placing the load over his two humps and because slower in pace. Both officers were enthusiastic over what they saw and heard of the camel in the Crimea, Lieutenant Porter declaring that in the United States, at any point south of 36̊(about the latitude of Raleigh, N. C.), the camel would be fostered with the greatest care, and that its value there for labor would be much greater than that of the horse. He expressed the hope that he might see the day when every Southern planter would be using the camel extensively, and he thought this not improbable, as a good work animal might then be imported from Smyrna for about $300.        The natural historians have generally designated the two-humped animal of this genus as the camel and the one-humped as the dromedary. After careful study and observation in the home of the animal Major Wayne disregarded this classification and speaks of it as of two distinct species-the Bactrian and the Arabian. The Bactrian has two humps; it came originally from Bactria and is now found more generallv in Tartary and the northern parts of Central Asia. The Arabian has but one hump and is found principally in Arabia, Persia, Asia Minor, and India. The dromedary (Greek  dromas , a runner) is simply a swift courser, or racer, as distinguished from the camel of burden (always, however, Arabian, or one-humped).   Two of the three camels procured at Tunis had  shown symptoms of the itch; and, as it was feared that they might infect the ship with the disease, they were sold. Their lazy life on the vessel, coupled with good care and abundant food, had so fattened them that there was no trouble in finding a Turkish butcher, whose bid of $44 for the two was accepted. The Sultan, professing great interest in the experiment of our Government, offered to present 4 of his finest animals, but, as they had to be fetched from Asia, our officers deemed it imprudent to wait. Persia had been thought to be the best place to procure fine camels, but it was now so late in the season that the mountain passes were filled with snow and ice, and a trip to that distant country would have been difficult, if not impossible. So the  Supply  was headed for Egypt, arriving at Alexandria in December. Major Wayne journeyed on to Cairo, where he purposed buying 20 dromedaries. An unexpected obstacle was encountered in the ""custom of the country.'' In order to avoid having all his good camels and horses sent out of his domain to supply the wants of the Eastern war, the viceroy had made a law that no animal of any kind should be exported, and it was with the greatest difficulty that he was prevailed upon to issue a permit, first for the exportation of 2 camels, then of 10. The last concession came too late, however, as, wearying of the slow processes of oriental routine (the negotiations being conducted in due form through the American consul), Major Wayne had determined to sail after loading but 3 camels. But now the viceroy himself had become interested in the experiment of the United States, and proposed to present the Government with 6 dromedaries.  It seems to have been the, intention of the ruler to present 6 of his finest beasts, and on learning of the proposed gift the major and lieutenant were aroused to the highest pitch of pleased anticipation, particularly as they had met with such ill success in their purchases and had been so worried by the unforeseen rules against exportation. They expected nothing less than a group of lithe-limbed, deep-chested racers of the best blood of Oman or Nubia-the flower of the royal herd, with pedigrees reaching back toward the beginnings of recorded time. After a week of impatient waiting, they were informed that the present of the potentate was in readiness in the palace yard, and, upon going to embark it, their chagrin was severe when, instead of the swift, well-kept dromedaries of the desert, they found a wretched half dozen of the commonest street camels of Alexandria, their hanging heads showing the spirit broken by ill usage, half denuded of hair by the itch, and loathsome from disease. Lieutenant Porter spurned the gift and took little pains to conceal his disgust. The viceroy's minister was informed of the miscarriage of his master's well-intended liberality, and the blame was laid on the rascally subordinates to whom the selection of the present had been intrusted; and, after another week of waiting, 6 fairly good camels were forthcoming. Thus, when the  Supply  sailed on January 22, 1856, she had on board 9 dromedaries and the Tunis camel.    Our officers reached Smyrna January 30, and, by        having sent in advance Mr. Gwynn H. Heap, they were able to assemble rapidly the remainder of their shipment and prepare pack saddles and covers. This latter item was carefully attended to, as it was certain that properly fitting saddles could not be obtained in the United States. Mr. Heap's acquaintance with the languages and customs of the East, gained while serving as vice-consul at Tunis, enabled him to purchase the animals to the best advantage. Those he brought to Smyrna were bought at various points in the interior, the town camel being avoided, as it was generally infected with the itch caught from the streets and dirty khans. He appears to have paid as low as $100 for at least one animal and as high as $400 each for several others, the average price being about $250. No such fancy prices as $1,800 to $2,000 for a single animal were paid, although the idea was prevalent at the time in this country that the camels had cost the Government about $2,000 each.  The prices, indeed, were found to vary, as do those of horses, according to breeding, size, training, and soundness, ranging from $15 to $1,000 and over. A sound burden camel capable of carrying from 400 to 600 pounds could be bought at $50 to $130, a dromedary at $45 to $l,000, the common stock bringing $45 to $150, and the swifter, purebred animals from $150 up. A good Tuilu, or Maya, brought $200, while two-humped Bactrian breeders sold at $300 to $600.    Lieutenant Porter solved, with his customary  intelligence, the problem of loading the camels into the ship. He built first a boat 20 feet long and 7 feet wide, flat-bottomed so that it would easily slide up on thebeach. He then constructed the ""camel car,"" very strongly made and bound with iron, with a door at each end, and shaped to fit snugly into the boat. The camel was coaxed into the car, or, if he withstood coaxing and refused to enter, ten sailors with a block and tackle forced him in. The car, mounted on trucks, was then rolled down the beach and into the boat. The car weighed 1,000 pounds and by means of it the animals, averaging in weight 1,400 pounds, but going as high as 2,000 pounds, were loaded into the ship at the rate of one each half hour.    The home voyage was begun February 15, 1856,  with 33 animals, as follows: Nine dromedaries, or runners, 23 camels of burden, and 1 calf. Among them were 2 Bactrian males (two humped) for use in breeding with the Arabian female. The offspring, called a ""booghdee"" (male Tuilu and female Maya), is always one humped and much heavier than the pure Arabian and on this account is greatly prized as a burden-carrying animal.  Mr. Heap had picked up a fine Tuilu, an enormous fellow 7 feet 5 inches in height, 10 feet long, 9 feet 9 inches in girth, and weighing when in good condition 2,000 pounds. Lieutenant Porter was obliged to cut a hole in the floor of the deck which served as the ceiling of the camel stable in order to accommodate this Tuilu’s hump. Seven males were included in the load, the remainder being females, not counting the booghdee, which will not breed.          It was an interesting voyage  home. The staunch little sailing craft met the most tremendous gales in the Mediterranean and was buffeted by unusually heavy weather during most of her trip across the Atlantic. It was often necessary, in order that they might not be injured by the tossing of the sea during the more violent storms, to tie the camels down in the position they assume when kneeling to receive their burdens, which posture they held for days at a time, eating and drinking much as usual and suffering no harm beyond a temporary stiffening of the joints.          The camels occupied a huge  stable between decks. A thoughtful contrivance was a covered structure 60 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 10 feet high, which was placed on the upper deck, above the animals' quarters. Along the sides of this were placed at frequent intervals large portholes fitted with glass windows and heavy shutters. A hatch was provided in the top so as to lot the animals down to their deck, and this aperture, being so far above the upper deck, could be kept open even during storms when it was necessary to close the portholes.  Thus fresh air was assured in all kinds of weather-a very important matter on shipboard.          The success of this part of the        experiment was due to the sagacity and watchfulness of Lieutenant Porter, who reduced the care of the animals to a military basis. He promulgated a set of ""rules and regulations for the camel deck,"" requiring, among other things, that one person should always be on watch; the camels to be fed and watered every day at 3 o'clock precisely; the females having young to be fed and watered, in addition, at 7 o'clock in the morning; the deck never to be wet except by order; the hayracks to be filled every two days, and the amount of food to be kept account of; the camels never to be struck with anything but the flat-of the hand; their beds to be littered down before sunset: each camel to be curried and brushed half an hour every day and their feet and legs to be well rubbed; their feet to be cleaned with soap and water twice a week; particular care to be observed in putting hay under their knees and haunches when they lie down; "" the least thing the matter with an animal to be reported at once."" The strictest cleanliness was exacted, the stalls being cleaned daily, and frequently whitewashed. The daily ration of food consisted of a gallon of oats, 10 pounds of hay, and a gallon of water to each animal, this being varied by occasional portions of crushed pease or barley made into a dough ball; salt was served once a week. The animals got along very well on this regimen, although their natural diet consists of the leaves and tender branches of all kinds of trees and shrubs, while they have a special fondness for dried bushes of a bitter and astringent flavor and seem to consider prickly and thorny vegetation a dainty.          No experiments were made to  ascertain how long the camels could go without water, and the information gained by the investigations of the expedition show that the tales on this subject are largely fables. The camel needs water each day, and gets along best when so supplied. He has a set of several stomachs, in one at least of which are cells where water is stored to the extent of about a gallon and a half, and this can be drawn upon when the animal does not get his daily supply. Habituated to traveling across the deserts, he has through the centuries developed the power of going from five to eight days without a drink, and nature has assisted him by giving him a skin so constructed that he perspires very scantily. But there is nothing in his supposed habit of drinking vast quantities of water and concealing it about his body for use in emergencies. His hump does, indeed, supply him with nourishment when at work where food is scarce, this being very well shown by the, fact that during a long, hard trip this unsightly protuberance gradually decreases in size, so that it is necessary to change the length of the packing thongs accordingly, until at the end of the trip the hump has almost entirely disappeared. The substance of the hump is pure fat. After a course of high living without work, the hump so increases in size that it is awkward to place a saddle on the animal. It is said to be customary then to slit the skin, lay it back, and cut off slices of fat. This fat has somewhat the appearance of thick cream and was said to be much esteemed by the Arabs, who use it in tea and coffee, but our investigators had no opportunity of testing it.    The strict regulation against wetting the camel        deck was necessary, because the camel can travel over any kind of surface except one that is slippery. In Asia Minor, Syria, Persia, North Hindoostan, and Tartary he travels loaded across valleys and mountain ranges and deserts alike, exhibiting no hesitancy except when he encounters ice or mud. Here he loses control of himself, spreads his legs wide apart, and if not helped generally ends by the dislocation of shoulders or hips or by literally splitting himself up, an injury which is, always fatal.    Six Arabs, one of them a Bedouin of the desert,        were engaged to go along with the ship, with the idea that they would be useful in caring for the animals, but they proved helpless in bad weather, and their services were unnecessary in good weather. A Turk was also employed because he represented himself to be a ""camel M. D.,"" perfectly familiar with the management of camels, their diseases and treatment. This gentleman turned out to be an Oriental Sangrado. His cure for a cold was a piece of cheese; for swelled legs, tea mixed with gunpowder; and for some further trifling complaint he gravely proposed to tickle the animal's nose with a chameleon's tail. He was soon set aside by the common sense of Lieutenant Porter. In giving birth, one of the camels died, this being attributed to an injury received in loading. Two young ones, born soon after leaving, Smyrna, were so much treated by the camel doctor that they also died; four others born during the voyage were kept out of his hands and would have come on very well, but one was starved because the mother could not be induced to rise and suckle it during a ten days' storm; another was accidentally lain on by an old camel and crushed. The other two were successfully reared, and, having the run of the camel deck, amused the whole ship by their friskiness and precocity; they were thoroughly at home in the worst of weather, perfectly steady on their legs, going about the deck without falling during gales that forced even the sailors to hold on to some support. Such remarkable seamanship was attributed to the fact that they were born at sea.          The show animals of the lot  were two handsome dromedaries-one a Nomanieh from Oman, the other a Sennai from Nubia. Of all dromedaries the swiftest and most enduring is the Nomanieh, as it is also the best for riding, its natural gait being a movement of the hind leg and foreleg on opposite sides at the same time, or a movement of each leg in rapid succession.  This gait must be taught to other breeds, as they naturally move in a rough trot. A good Nomanieh can travel from 90 to 100 miles a day, but can not keep such traveling up day after day.  From fifteen to twenty days he can keep up a gait of 50 to 60 miles a day.  Many stories are, of course, related of feats of endurance and speed, but these are to be taken with allowance. Our explorers found that the mail was regularly carried between Cairo and Suez on a camel. The distance is 84 miles and was covered in eighteen hours.  The burden camel usually carries from 250 to 400 pounds, and travels regularly from 20 to 30 miles a day.          In the cargo were 4  Pehlevans-camels which had been taught to wrestle, a sport which is common in the East. It seems that without any training at all the animals engage in contests which are a sort of wrestling bouts. Whenever two males meet for the first time, especially if there are any females about, an encounter of this kind is indulged in. The camel that is thrown to the ground acknowledges his inferiority by scarcely daring thenceforward to look at the females. This natural propensity is cultivated by the Arabs and Turks, and the young camel is taught to wrestle, with some degree of science, by hoisting the right foreleg over the neck of his antagonist and coming down upon him with all the weight of the body. One of the Arabs employed by Major Wayne amused himself on the voyage by training ""Uncle Sam,"" a month-old camel, to wrestle, a pastime at which he soon became so proficient and which he liked so well that it was found necessary to tie him up, as he developed the trick of making sudden rushes at the men and throwing them to the deck.          It was in the midst of the  rutting season when the animals were taken on board at Smyrna. At this period both sexes are cross and disposed to kick and bite. ""The camel's kick is soft,"" says the Arab proverb, ""but it takes life away;"" its bite is not less terrible, as its heavy jaws and the leverage of its long neck enable it to pull and tear with great force. The females were exposed to the males constantly at this period with the purpose of securing as many young as possible at the earliest time. Except at this season, the camels were found, as a rule, docile and well behaved. The animal's patience is sometimes strained beyond endurance by the brutality of its drivers; at such times it displays some cunning in awaiting until the man is well within its power, when it takes summary vengeance. It appears to believe, however, with the American Constitution, that no man should be put in jeopardy twice for the same offense; and the driver who has mistreated a camel will place some part of his clothing where the beast may find it; and, after trampling and tearing the offender's coat, the camel is well satisfied and harbors no further grudge. When it does become necessary to discipline the beasts, our experimenters were cautioned that the punishment must be severe; they were instructed to take a heavy club flattened at the end and with this to strike the animal with great force on the left side of the neck about 6 inches back of the jaw and to keep up the beating until the refractory animal rolled on the ground in sign of submission.          Mr. Albert Ray, the keeper of  the camels, who performed his work with sagacity and zeal, does not appear to have made any warm friendships among the. animals, although they were individually named and kept track of in his journal, in the picturesque nomenclature of the Orient, as Gourmal, Adela, Mahomet, Massandra, lbrim, Ayesha, and so on. Such friendships are common enough, however, among the Arabs, as the camel, when well treated, is inclined to become attached to his master, though perhaps to a lesser degree than the dog or horse.   By his intelligent and energetic care Lieutenant Porter thus        kept his charges in excellent health, and landed safely at Indianola, Tex., May 14, 1856, 34 camels (a gain of 1 on the voyage), all apparently in really better condition than when taken from the sandy wastes of their native deserts.    After some days of rest the herd was marched by easy stages to San Antonio, Tex., about 120 miles, where Major Wayne set about making arrangements to establish a camel ranch and to attempt the breeding of the animals. His plans were interfered with by Secretary Davis, whose idea was to find out first whether or not the animals, in the language of his instructions, were adapted to military service, and could be economically, and usefully employed therein,"" although he directed that they be given ample time to recover from their long voyage.          Some experimentation along this        line was at once attempted. Major Wayne reported that, having removed his camp to Green Valley, 60 miles from San Antonio, he one day sent three 6-mule teams, with a wagon to each team, and 6 camels to San Antonio for a supply of oats. In going the camels were held back to accommodate themselves to the slower pace of the mules. Returning, the camels carried 3,648 pounds of oats, while the wagons brought 1,800 pounds each. Thus 3 camels were equal to 6 mules and a wagon, and, in addition, the camels came to camp in two and one-half days, while the mules were nearly five days in performing the journey.          One day at Indianola Major  Wayne, who had been greatly annoyed by the skeptical attitude assumed by many persons throughout the country, and particularly by the jests of the unbelievers in the Texan town, thought to teach these latter a lesson. He brought up one of his finest pets, and, having caused it to kneel, ordered 2 bales of bay, weighing 314 pounds each, placed upon it. The knowing by-standers were convinced that the animal could not rise with such a load, but they laughed in scorn when the Major ordered 2 more bales piled on, making an aggregate weight of 1,256 pounds.  To the amazement of all, and to the utter confusion of the scoffers, the camel, at the word of command, easily rose and walked off with his burden. This signal victory for the camel partisans created no little talk, and the incident was chronicled in verse by a local Texas poet, though unhappily, says Major Wayne, when he made his report, ""I have not at hand a copy of the paper in which the ode was published,"" and it thus failed of official immortality.          ""On another occasion,"" to use  the language of Secretary Davis in his annual report of December, 1856, ""the capacity of the camel for traveling over steep acclivities and on muddy roads was tested with the most satisfactory result. Instead of making the detour rendered necessary by the location of the road to avoid a rugged mountain impracticable for wagons, the camels followed a trail which passed directly ever it and, a heavy rain occurring while they were at the depot to which they had been sent for supplies, the road was rendered so muddy that it was considered impassable for loaded wagons. The train of camels were nevertheless loaded with an average of 323 pounds each and returned to their encampment, a distance of 60 miles, in two days, suffering, as it is reported, no interruption or unusual fatigue from the mud over which they passed or the torrents of rain which fell upon them. These tests fully realize the anticipations entertained of their usefulness in the transportation of military   supplies. The experiment of introducing them into the climate of the  United States has been confined to the southern frontier of Texas. Thus far the result is as favorable as the most sanguine could have hoped * * * The very intelligent officer who was sent abroad to procure them, and who has remained in charge of them, expresses entire confidence both of their great value for the purposes of transportation and their adaptation to the climate of a large portion of the United States.""          It should be noted that, in  addition to this favorable opinion expressed by Major Wayne, that ""intelligent officer,"" in his letters to the Department, placed especial stress on the comparison in usefulness between the camel and the mule, claiming superiority for the former and pointing out that the camel required less food and no more attention than the mule.    Something over $20,000 of the sum appropriated        by Congress was yet unexpended, and in June Lieutenant Porter was furnished with $10,000 of this and directed to fetch home on the  Supply  another shipload of camels. The storeship then lay at New York, and, as food for the return trip, she took on board l5O bales (about 20 tons) of hay, 6,000 gallons of oats, 10 barrels of beans, 500 gallons of barley, 50 pounds of powdered sulphur, and 50 pounds of lard. The Department commissioned Mr. Heap at $2,000 a year and expenses and sent him on ahead directly to Smyrna, where, by the time that Porter arrived in November, he had collected from the interior a shipment of fine young animals. The Sultan of Turkey, through our minister at Constantinople, presented 6 dromedaries, which were included in this shipment. On the whole, this shipload was a much finer lot than those procured on the first trip. At Smyrna Lieutenant Porter employed nine men and a boy at $15 a month each and brought them along to help care for the animals. The Government continued to employ some of these men, together with some of those who were brought over on the first trip, for many years at $10 to $15 a month. One of them at least, Hiogo Alli, remained in the service as camel driver, interpreter, or mail carrier until 1870, when, on being discharged, he filed a claim for further employment on the ground that such was due him under the contract made in 1856.    Lieutenant Porter sailed for home November 14,        and, although meeting the roughest weather he had ever encountered, he lost but 3 camels on a voyage of eighty-eight days, and was able to turn over to Major Wayne, at Indianola, February 10, 1857, 41 animals, all in fine condition. The new animals were taken to Camp Verde, which was now officially designated the camel station. Up to this time Wayne had lost 5 of his first herd-2 by Spanish fever (a disease incident to acclimation), 1 by epilepsy, 1 from the bite of a particularly ferocious companion, and 1 from blows probably inflicted by a mule driver who did not take kindly to the foreign beast.  The second shipload thus raised the camel herd to 70 in number.      In February, 1857, the Senate directed the  Secretary of War to furnish it with a report regarding his camel experiment. This report was submitted the same month, and is a well-written and comprehensive document comprising the letters of Lieutenant Porter and Major Wayne, together with the information they had obtained and the conclusions they had drawn.          About this time the  administration of President Buchanan came in and with it John B. Floyd as Secretary of War. Major Wayne, who had thus far conducted the camel experiment so vigorously and efficiently, was now transferred to the office of the Quartermaster General at Washington, and could not, of course, give his personal attention longer to the Government camels, though he continued his interest in them, and was honored with a first-class medal from the Société impériale zoölogique d'acclimatation of Paris, for his successful introduction and acclimatization of camels into this country.    During the summer of 1857 the camels were used        sparingly in carrying supplies and in short scouts. In the fall of that year Lieut. Edward Fitzgerald Beale, afterwards a brigadier-general, and also minister to Austria under President Grant, was employed to open a wagon road from Fort Defiance, N. Mex., to the eastern frontiers of California, and a part of the herd of camels was put at his disposal for this expedition. The journey occupied forty-eight days through an unexplored wilderness of forest and plain and desert, the Colorado River being reached October 18. Lieutenant Beale speaks in the most enthusiastic terms of the work performed by the camels on this arduous trip. He says that they saved the members of the expedition from many hardships, and excited the admiration of the whole party by their ability and willingness to perform the tasks set them. He started with the determination that the experiment should be most thorough, and subjected the camels to trials ""which no other animals could possibly have endured."" On the desert they carried the water for the mules; traversed stretches of country covered with the sharpest volcanic rock without injury to their feet; climbed with heavy packs over mountains where the unloaded mules found it difficult to go even with the assistance of the dismounted riders; and, to the surprise of all the party, plunged into rivers without hesitation and swam them with ease. The lieutenant concludes that he would rather have one of the camels for such work than four of the best of his mules. One of the men who had charge of the camels on this trip, writing home to the Richmond (Va.) Examiner, paints the same rosy picture of their entire docility and utility.    This and other favorable reports induced  Secretary Floyd in his annual report in December, 1858, to make, some interesting comments. ""The entire adaptation of camels,"" he says, ""to military operations on the plains may now be taken as demonstrated."" The beast, to his mind, had already proved its ""great usefulness and superiority over the horse for all movements upon the plains or deserts,"" it would be of great value against the marauding Indians, and would materially reduce the expenses of the quartermaster's department in furnishing transportation. He recommended that Congress at once ""authorize the purchase of 1,000 camels."" So far was Congress from authorizing such a wholesale purchase, however, that it did not appropriate a cent, and a year afterwards, in December, 1859, the favorable reports continuing, the Secretary renewed his recommendation. He said:            The experiments thus far made-and they are pretty full-demonstrate that camels constitute a most useful and economic means of transportation for men and supplies through the great desert and barren portions of our interior * * * An abundant supply of these animals would enable our Army to give greater and prompter protection to our frontiers and to all our interoceanic routes than three times their cost expended in another way. As a measure of economy I can not too strongly recommend the purchase of a full supply to the consideration of Congress.        But that body could not, as so often happens,  see the matter in the same light as the Secretary, and did nothing toward loosening the purse strings for this purpose. By December, 1860, the Secretary was still further confirmed in his opinion of the good work of the camels, and reiterated his recommendations of the two preceding years.    Secretary Floyd probably based his beliefs and recommendations largely  upon the reports of Lieutenant Beale, for, after the successful trip of that officer from Texas to California to open a wagon road through the wilderness, the Secretary had placed twenty of the camels in his hands to be employed by him in national explorations. These expeditions were made over a large part of the Southwest, more particularly in the Rocky Mountains, and extended over a period of four years. During this time the animals rendered efficient service and were so well cared for by Lieutenant Beale that in 1861, with the incoming of a new administration and a new Secretary of War, he turned over to the Government quartermaster in California a herd of 28, all in good condition. For the next two years these 28, with several others that had been brought on from Texas, were held at the various forts and military stations in California, no one of the officers in charge appearing to be able to find any work for them to do. In 1862 Lieutenant Beale wrote to Secretary Stanton describing the idle and unfavorable conditions under which the animals were then kept, stating that instead of any natural increase since he had returned them, 3 of the finest had died, and proposing to take all of the remainder, give bond for their safe return at any time demanded, and to use them in further exploration and in packing supplies across the great basin. At this time, he states, they were ""of no earthly use either to the Government or anyone else,"" and the expense of their maintenance was about $500 a month. This proposition was rejected, and a year later a plan was set on foot by Deputy Quartermaster E. B. Babbitt, stationed at San Francisco, to employ the camels in carrying the mail between Fort Mohave, N. Mex., and New San Pedro (Wilmington), Cal. Objection was made to this plan by both Lieut. D. J. Williamson, commanding at the former place, and Capt. William G. Morris, at the latter, their reasons being based on statements entirely the reverse of those officially made by Major Wayne and Lieutenant Beale.          Acting on this unfavorable  information, General Babbitt reported to the Department that for two years he had endeavored in vain to render the camels serviceable, and gave it as his conclusion that experience had proved ""the inexpediency of substituting them for our native animals."" At this time the animals in California numbered 35 in all, and were kept in the southern part of the State. The report of General Babbitt produced an order from the Department, on September 9, 1863, directing him to advertise and sell the camels at public auction. This was duly carried out, and the animals were purchased by Samuel McLaughlin, in whose care they had been for some time before.          It is probable that most of  these camels found their way into menageries or zoological gardens. It has been supposed that some of them were taken to Nevada to be employed in packing salt from the deserts for use in silver extraction, but as the Nevada camels were of the two-humped kind, they probably came from a different source. In 1860 or 1861 a company was formed in San Francisco for the purpose of importing camels from Asia. They sent an agent to the high tablelands of Central Asia and procured about 20 Bactrian, or two-humped, camels, and from this herd came the 12 animals that were employed for some time in carrying salt from a marsh in Esmeralda County, Nev., to the Washoe silver mill, a distance of 200 miles. They performed this work satisfactorily, carrying, says Mr. L. Metral, of Virginia City, who packed them, an average of 600 pounds each, and traveling from 15 to 20 miles a day. The discovery of salt at a more accessible point deprived them of much of their occupation, although they remained in the vicinity of Virginia City for a number of years.    Professor Brewer, of Yale College, records that during a trip through the        West, made about 1865, he saw a few of the animals near Virginia City. ""Their backs,"" he says, ""had not been cared for, and they had been used in packing heavy loads of salt from the deserts. Salt water and alkali had accumulated in the long hair of their humps, their pack saddles had galled them, and great loathsome sores nearly covered the parts touched by the saddle. A pitiless snow squall was sweeping just then over this inhospitable region, and these miserable beasts, having fallen into bad hands in a bad climate, looked sadly enough."" As late as June 28, 1876, the Virginia City Enterprise contained an account of an ascent of Mount Davidson made by a train of 8 camels, each carrying one-third of a cord of wood. The animals approached to within 150 feet of the summit, reaching an altitude of nearly 9,000 feet.          The historian H. H. Bancroft  states that in 1876 the Nevada camels were all taken to Arizona, with the exception of one pair which, placed on a ranch in the Carson Valley, in a few years increased to 26. The story of the remarkable fecundity of this pair of camels spread far and wide, finding its way into Major Leonard's important work on The Camel, published in 1893, as well as into the encyclopedias. It should, however, be taken with great allowance, when it is remembered that the female camel gives birth but once in three years, and does not begin to breed until 5 years of age. The employment of the animals for practical purposes in Nevada steadily diminished. Their appearance on the public roads frightened horses, thereby giving rise to suits for damage, and leading finally to legislation prohibiting their use on the public highways and their running at large.    In the meantime the camels left at Camp Verde were employed in various  errands to places over the State and became so common a sight on the streets of several towns that they ceased to excite curiosity. In some instances they were looked upon as a nuisance, because they frightened horses, and the city council of Brownsville is said to have passed an ordinance forbidding them the streets.    Thus they remained until the outbreak of the  Civil War, increasing naturally to some extent, showing themselves well adapted to the climate and other conditions of Texas, and described in the papers of the day by those who saw them as healthy and strong, of greater stature and in all respects superior to the camels of the traveling menageries. At the beginning of the war the camel station passed into the hands of the Confederates, from whom the herd received scant attention, being allowed to pick up its own living by grazing. Naturally, some of the animals wandered away.  Of these there is an official account of at least 3. These were captured in Arkansas by the Union forces and ""sent to Mr. Paden, near the Des Moines River, in Iowa, for the benefit of his care and economy in their support."" In June, 1863, Lieut. J. Grayler, from the headquarters of the Department of the Missouri, at St. Louis, asked the Department what he should do with them; the Quartermaster-General, on the ground that the number was too small for use, recommended that they be sold at public auction, which action was accordingly ordered by Secretary Stanton.          Doubtless others of the herd  during this period of loose discipline wandered off from Camp Verde and found their way westward to the deserts and mountains of the Texas Panhandle, of New Mexico and of Arizona, where they lived free and half wild, the prey of hunters both white and red. There are numerous recorded instances where soldiers or hunters have seen the animals and pursued them. These instances occur with decreasing frequency down to within the past ten years.          When at the close of the Civil        War the Federal Government was again in charge of Camp Verde, all thought of making practical use of the camels was abandoned. The number was now 44, and in March, 1866, sealed proposals to buy them were invited. The bids were opened at New Orleans, at the office of the chief quartermaster, Col. E. G. Sawtelle. Three persons were willing to buy: Horace Bell offered $5 each; Joseph Hallam, $10 each; while Col. Bethel Coop- wood's bid was $31 each.  Gen. M. C. Meigs, Quartermaster-General at Washington, reluctantly gave the order to sell at $31 each, expressing at the same time his belief that private enterprise would better develop the animal in this country and his regret that the experiment had failed.          The camels were delivered to  Colonel Coopwood at San Antonio, Tex., and kept by him in that vicinity until December, 1866, when they were driven into Mexico. In January, 1867, 12 of them were sold to the proprietor of a ""circus and caravan, "" and the remainder appear to have been, during the next fifteen years, disposed of in the same manner. As late as May, 1903, the Express, of San Antonio, speaks of having observed in one of the mid-way shows which had exhibited in that city a camel with the United States brand on it and the counterbrand of a subsequent purchaser. No doubt a search through the many menageries, traveling shows, and the zoological gardens of the country would reveal other survivors of the Government camels, although their number is likely to be few, as it is now more than thirty-five years since they passed from Government ownership, and the camel does not often, even with the best treatment, attain to more than 40 years.    Thus, after a checkered official life of eleven        years, the camels passed finally into the hands of private owners. Of the two shiploads of animals, the Government retains nothing except the bones of one of the beasts, which stand in a case at the National Museum at Washington and perform the duty of illustrating to students the peculiar skeleton framework of the ""ship of the desert,"" besides serving as a souvenir to those acquainted with the story of the attempt to transplant these ancient drudges from their homes in Africa and Asia to the Western World. The camel in question, while at Fort Tejon, Cal., was killed by one of its mates that had gotten loose during the night. The animals were rutting and consequently intractable. The soldiers relate that the combat was most furious, the beasts striking each other resounding blows with their ponderous feet, while the drivers dared not interfere. The bones of the defeated animal were forwarded by Lieut. Sylvester Mowry to the Smithsonian Institution.          The        most potent cause of the failure of the camel experiment was its interruption by the Civil War. Had Major Wayne been left in control of the camels which were imported under his supervision and supplied with sufficient money to breed and increase them, as he so well knew was necessary, and had he been free to familiarize the teamsters and drivers with their management, there appears to be no particular reason why they should not have been of as much use in parts of this country as they were and are in the countries of the East. They were easily and quickly acclimatized and they performed with success their tasks in the initial experiments; indeed, so long as Major Wayne remained with them. But few officers understood their management, and they found in the mule driver an inveterate enemy. To secure their general use, a long course of experimentation, as well as teaching, was required. The beginning of the Civil War removed Major Wayne to the South, and during the succeeding years the camels were exposed to capture and recapture by the contending forces, neither of which had much time to devote to experiment. The construction of railways between the East and West, of course, limited the field in which it was proposed to use the camels, but they might still have been employed to advantage had anyone been found with the enthusiasm and information on the subject possessed by Major Wayne to collect and care for the scattered remnants of the herd and increase it to such numbers as might be of some real use. In idleness they were merely a useless expense to the Government and were very properly sold; but, as in the case of any unfinished experiment, it is to be regretted that the trial of the camel in the Western world was not carried to conclusive results."

McPherson The History of San Juan County   At the same time that the uranium industry in Monument Valley was booming, a second industry, oil, became increasingly prominent in the Aneth-Montezuma Creek area. Starting in 1953, Humble Oil and Shell Oil initiated agreements with the Navajo Tribe and the State of Utah to exploit the rich petroleum reserves locked beneath the Aneth lands. The Texas Company drilled its first well on 16 February 1956 and welcomed a rapid flow of 1,704 barrels per day. Other companies responded immediately; suddenly the tribe found itself administering leases and rentals throughout the northern part of the reservation, known generally as the Four Corners Oil Field.                                    Pumping unit in White Mesa Oil Field in Aneth area              In 1956 alone the Aneth oil field yielded $34.5 million in royalties to the tribe. With a population of more than 80,000 members, the Navajo Nation decided against making a per capita distribution of the money, which would have amounted to only $425. Instead, the leaders invested the royalties in services such as education and economic development. Much of this money, however, was used in the central part of the reservation and not on the periphery where the oil wells producing this wealth were located.When the federal government agreed to the Aneth Extension in 1933, the law that removed the land from the public domain specified that 37.5 percent of the revenues coming from oil and gas in the Extension would be used for ""Navajos and such other Indians"" living on this section. The money could be spent on health, education, and general welfare of the Navajos. The law expanded in 1968 to include all Navajos living on the Utah portion of the reservation.   The Utah State Legislature established a three-member Indian commission in 1959 to return royalties of $632,000 to the Navajo people. On 27 July Governor George D. Clyde attended the first meeting and charged the group to carry out the law. The commission, composed of a chairman who was a member at large, an Indian member, and a citizen from San Juan County, undertook the awesome task of helping improve living conditions across the Utah reservation, from Aneth to Navajo Mountain.   In 1968 the government amended the 1933 act to include other services to be considered general welfare; it also extended the number of beneficiaries to include all of the Navajo people in San Juan County. Road development, establishment of health clinics, economic endeavors, and education filled the agendas of the committee. Different areas had their own requirements, which became so numerous and widespread that a full-time administrative organization was needed. The Utah Navajo Development Council (UNDC) was established in 1971 with an all-Navajo board to meet the growing urgency to deliver necessary services. From a fledgling organization, UNDC expanded rapidly. Take health care, for instance. During its first fiscal year, 1971–72, Navajos totaled 8,421 visits to the two clinics located at Navajo Mountain and Montezuma Creek; by 1983 another clinic had been added at Halchita (1975) and visits had doubled to 16,845. Figures relating to education, housing, livestock assistance, and other programs show a similar rise, indicating that the organization was meeting the needs of many Utah Navajos.   By 1978, however, there was rising discontent in the oil fields. On 30 March 1978, Navajos from the Aneth-Montezuma Creek area physically took over the main Texaco pump station in Aneth and eventually stopped all production throughout the entire region. With an activist spirit common to the late 1960s and early 1970s, the group, known as the Utah Chapter of the Council for Navajo Liberation, or the Coalition, attracted more than a thousand people sympathetic to its cause. On 3 April the group listed thirteen demands that included the need to renegotiate leases, more sensitive treatment of Navajos living in the oil fields, greater environmental concern, and more benefits for those directly affected by the oil pumps in their backyard. The four oil companies—Texaco, Superior, Continental, and Phillips—that owned the 200 wells in the area, generally acquiesced to the demands, except in regard to changing the lease agreements. This settlement ended almost three weeks of occupation by Navajo protesters.Today, however, many of the problems of the Aneth oil field continue. Mobil purchased Superior's wells, controlling those on both the north and south sides of the river in the Aneth region. Phillips and Texaco still pump oil in the Montezuma Creek area, but the Utah Navajo Development Council no longer provides services in the Utah strip. The Council and its subsidiary, Utah Navajo Industries, because of problems with mismanagement of funds, lost their economic power until legal action could be taken against those misusing the money.   Along with a diminishing number of barrels of oil and royalties, there is also diminishing enthusiasm for the oil fields among the older Navajo people, who complain of great environmental destruction. Younger Navajos often do not feel that complaint as strongly, welcoming the jobs, the royalties that pay for education and health benefits, and the other businesses attracted to the area. But, as with many other events, personalities, and technologies that have had an impact on the Aneth region, oil's long-term effects will more truly determine whether it has been beneficial or harmful.                                              Previous   |   Table of Contents   |   Utah History To Go   |   Top of Page   |   Next                                                               |  Contact Us   |   Bibliography   |  Site Map  |"

Most Utahns have heard of the Bear Lake monster, an Americanized version of Nessie of Loch Ness. But not too many know of Jerry, the Arabian camel.   In September 1936, Charles Kelly, a Western history buff of the first magnitude, was adding to his research notes on the Hastings Cutoff to California (his book  Salt Desert Trails  had been published a few years earlier) and he had occasion to talk to William Carter, an early Grantsville, Tooele County, resident. During the conversation, Carter's wife mentioned a dromedary that chased two frightened horses into Grantsville one Sunday in the early 1900s. She could recall no particular date.   ""The camel seemed tame,"" Kelly jotted in his notebook. ""Mrs. Carter says the school children rode it and she rode it in a July 24th parade…It later wandered off and was not seen again. It did not appear to be a young animal. They called it Jerry."" Kelly made no further mention of the camel, perhaps chalking the story off as folklore. But there is another possible answer; for Jerry, ""a ship of the desert,"" was not the first such sighting in the parched hinterlands of Nevada.   Reports cropped up from time to time in those days and as a matter of record, the Nevada legislature had taken the trouble to pass a law in February of 1875 prohibiting camels and dromedaries from running at large on public roads in the state. The act was repealed in 1899.   The business with camels had its impetus about 1850 with the California gold rush in full swing, and thousands of emigrants jamming the overland trails for a chance to settle in the land of milk and honey (and mayhaps find a lump or two of placer gold in the bargain). The Isthmus of Panama was choked with rushers who opted to steam to California. Still twenty years in the future was the transcontinental railroad, and the U.S. military was struggling with the knotty problem of protecting its real estate in the Southwest and lower California acquired in the war with Mexico.   How to move people and provisions through hostile Indian country and supply the forts spreading through Southern California and the Southwest? That was the question. Pack mules and ox trains were barely adequate in the desert regions…And so was born the Great Camel Experiment. The military had first toyed with the notion in 1836, but it wasn't until 1848 that a recommendation came to import a few camels in a test of their worth on the American frontier.   Horses are not native to America, but they flourished after being introduced by the Spanish Conquistadors in 1540. There is evidence that camels may have been brought to America by a Virginia slave trader in 1701 and to Jamaica about the same time. U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis proposed a military camel corps as early as 1855, but the American Southwest was not the Sahara and there was no Lawrence of Arabia on the horizon.   Still, if there was money to be made in such a venture, the private sector would eagerly pursue it. And so it did, in the form of the American Camel Company, a short-lived New York speculation which sputtered briefly in 1855, before expiring. The Army then budgeted $30,000 to ""purchase and import camels and dromedaries for the military."" One David Dixon Porter visited England and was encouraged to seek British Army opinion of camels. He also studied the animals at the London Zoo.   Ultimately, Porter with Major Henry C. Wayne arranged for shipping thirty-three Arabian camels from Smyrna to Indianola, Texas, in May 1856. A second drove of forty-four animals arrived the following year. Major Wayne was ordered to transfer the camels to San Antonio, and there to turn them over to a retired U.S. Navy lieutenant, Edward F. Beale, who had served for several years as Superintendent of Indian Affairs in California. It was he who brought the first California gold east and he had explored Death Valley with Kit Carson. Beale was a believer in camels for use in the Western deserts.   Secretary of War John B. Floyd, successor to Davis after the election of 1856, ordered a wagon route surveyed from Fort Defiance, New Mexcio, to the Colorado River, and Lt. Beale was his choice for the task, with collateral orders to test the dromedaries as pack animals at the same time. Thus to Lt. Edward F. Beale fell the honor of being the first and last commander of the U.S. Camel Corps.   It was during the transfer to San Antonio that Major Wayne overheard a number of grizzled Texans comment with some cynicism on the camels; allowing that they would have a bleak future in the United States. They ""walked funny"" and didn't look as if they could tote much. Wayne ordered a kneeling dromedary to be loaded with two bales of hay, each weighing 300 pounds—more than triple what a prime mule could pack. The onlookers murmured in disbelief. ""That hoss will never stand with that load."" At the major's signal, two additional bales were cinched to the beast's pack saddle—the total: 1,256 pounds! ""Impossible! Not a chance in h---!. Cain't be done!""   Wayne nudged the camel, which obediently lurched upright and strode off with the load. The crowd broke into cheers. The dromedaries had won their first supporters. When the grand experiment was over, Beale would prove camels could carry enormous loads—some up to a ton—walk forty miles in a day for as many as eight to ten days without water over barren country. They could swim—and did, across the Colorado—and function in sand or snow. Their drivers swore ""camels would get fat where a jackass would starve to death.""    On the strength of Beale's report, Secretary Floyd recommended the purchase of 1,000 dromedaries for the U.S. Army—but the clouds of Civil War were gathering, and the Experiment abandoned.    So what has all this to do with Jerry, the Grantsville camel? Well, Beale had turned over twenty-eight government dromedaries to the California Quartermaster in 1861. The Camel Corps story spread throughout the West (in this century, Hollywood would treat this historical footnote dramatically in ""Southwest Passage"" in 1954 and as a comedy in ""Hawmps"" in 1976.) The California and Utah Camel Association bought some Army animals in 1859 and sold them at auction to a company in Esmeralda County, Nevada, which employed them to carry salt from a marsh there to a silver mill in Washoe County some 200 miles distant.   The dromedaries didn't receive the same understanding care as they had in the Army and suffered from the high alkali content in the region. Neglected by teamsters, some camels died, others ran off into the desert and still others were sold to mine owners in Arizona to haul ore. It was said a party of Frenchmen had rounded up twenty to thirty camels near Tucson, broke them to pack, and sold them in Virginia City, where a visiting Yale professor reported seeing camels in 1865.   Within a decade, the animals had become enough of a nuisance on wagon roads to result in the previously mentioned legislative act prohibiting them to wander at large on Nevada's public roads. For years, there were scattered reports of camels seen in various parts of the Southwest and Nevada, and even remote areas of Utah. Those reports usually were accompanied by claims that the ""escaped circus animals"" were frightening horses, mules and teamsters—the teamsters, in turn, would open fire in the face of such ""vicious creatures."" Fortunately, the residents of Grantsville, were more curious than terrified when Jerry, the camel, visited their town.                                                      Previous   |   Table of Contents   |   Utah History To Go   |   Top of Page   |   Next                                                                    |  Contact Us   |   Bibliography   |  Site Map  |"

Lowe, Regional Forester, Forest Service      From:  Donald R. Knowles, Executive Director       Subject:  Regional Ecosystem Office Review of the Govey Commercial Thinning Project in the Olympic National Forest, Hood Canal Ranger District       SUMMARY    The Regional Ecosystem Office (REO) and the Interagency Late-Successional Reserve (LSR) Work Group have reviewed the above referenced silviculture proposal.  The REO finds that the Govey Timber Sale is consistent with the Record of Decision ( ROD ) for the Northwest Forest Plan requirements for silvicultural activities in LSRs.     BACKGROUND    The Olympic National Forest, Hood Canal Ranger District proposes 286 acres of variable density thinning in a 56-year-old stand within the Hood Canal South LSR, number RW104.  The project is designed to meet LSR objectives as described in the  ROD.      Documents submitted for review include the Govey Timber Sale Environmental Assessment (EA) and the Hood Canal South LSR Assessment.  Personal communication with the Ranger District's personnel has also occurred.  This review is based on Alternative 2 of the EA, which was indicated as the most likely alternative to be implemented.     Tractor and skyline yarding systems will be used to thin from below at a variable spacing, with more intensively thinned patches scattered across the project area to promote canopy gap formation.  Approximately 3.3 miles of temporary road construction will occur.  Roads will be closed after the sale, and decommissioned after site-related activities are completed.  In addition, 2.5 miles of skid trails and 5.8 acres of landings will be constructed.     Harvest will occur in Riparian Reserves, but will not occur below the slope break to the creek.      PROPOSED TREATMENTS AND CONSISTENCY WITH THE ROD    Stands originating from clearcut harvest will be thinned to a target relative density of 30, resulting in approximately 100 reserve trees per acre, variably spaced but averaging 20 feet between reserve trees.  Approximately 1-2 acres per 40 acres will be thinned to approximately 40 trees per acre to promote canopy-gap habitat.  Structural and species diversity of the forest stand would be retained by reserving all trees >22"" dbh, all Pacific Yew >3"" dbh, down trees greater than 20"" dbh, and all hardwoods.  Some hardwoods, however, may be removed for operation purposes, such as road rights-of-way, hazard trees, or skyline corridors.  All cull green trees and snags will be retained, those that must be felled for safety reasons will be left on-site for Coarse Woody Material (CWM).  The proposed treatment is consistent with silviculture Standards and Guidelines (S&Gs) in the  ROD    (p. C-12) and incorporates the structures and processes known to occur in late-successional ecosystems (p. B-5).     The target CWM retention is 10 trees/acre of the average, post-harvest stand diameter (14-15"").  This target is designed to provide an initial contribution towards achieving 15% or more ground cover of CWM when the forest reaches a fully functional stage.  CWM retention levels and target goals are based on local research.  Some blowdown is expected to occur in the stand after the first winter, and possibly into the second winter.  After the first or second winter, snags and down trees will be inventoried and enough green trees will be felled to meet the CWM target of 10 down trees per acre.  Trees will be felled with a service contract.  If contract funding is not available, a contingency is to fell the trees during annual chainsaw certification and training.     Approximately 3.27 miles of temporary road construction would occur, with approximately   2.46 miles of it occurring as reconstruction on railroad grades used in the late 1930s.  Construction is minimized to the extent needed to execute the project.  Roads are routed through a 50-year-old forest.  They will be closed after the project, and decommissioned after site-related activities are completed.  Approximately 2.5 miles of skid trails will be constructed, as well as 5.8 acres of landings.      Closed roads will be ripped and seeded with an erosion-control seed mix.  The seed mix comprises non-native sterile seeds.  Impact analysis for introduction of non-native species ( ROD , p. C-19) indicates that this introduction will not retard or prevent attainment of LSR objectives, because the seed mix is sterile, and there is an urgency to establish ground cover to preclude invasion by tansy ragwort, a noxious weed.  Native trees and shrubs will be planted when necessary to strengthen soils.     Harvest will occur within Riparian Reserves.  A watershed analysis for the South Fork Skokomish Key Watershed was completed.  The project was deemed by the forest to be consistent with this analysis.     CONCLUSION    The REO finds that the proposed activity in the Govey Sale is consistent with S&Gs for silviculture activities within LSRs west of the cascades.  Project development was done in close coordination with the research community.  Application of these research results lends strong support to the project, indicating that the prescriptions will prove more beneficial to late-successional conditions than if no actions were taken.     cc:   T.Nygren   J.Ulbrich   REO Staff   RIEC   Forest Supervisor, OLY   464/ly                                         Questions or comments         about this web site?

Sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo                      Cowboys Association (PCRA), the four-day annual event attracts                      over 12,000 rodeo fans from across the United States each                      year. The rodeo's contestants, from all over the United States                      and Canada, participate in such events as bareback bronc riding,                      calf roping, saddle bronc riding, steer wresting, team roping,                      barrel racing, and bull riding. In addition to the rodeo contests,                      there is western music, a rodeo queen competition, parade                      chili cook-off, rodeo mixer, golf tournament, mutton bustin'                      for the children, performances by the Stampede Drill Team                      and a ""Bull Bash,"" a one-day spin-off event consisting                      of bull riding, clowns, bull fighters, barrel men and barrel                      racing. Proceeds from the ""Bull Bash"" are donated                      to Mitchell-area charitable organizations. Every year since                      1979, the Corn Palace Stampede belt buckle has become a tradition;                      these brass buckles, depicting various rodeo events, are numbered                      each year and have a brief history of the Corn Palace Stampede                      Rodeo engraved on the back.                      The                      Corn Palace Stampede Rodeo derives its name from the Corn                      Palace building. Built in 1892, the original Corn Palace,                      called ""The Corn Belt Exposition"" was used to display, in                      order to demonstrate the fertility of the state's soil, the                      products of the harvest of South Dakota's farmers in a mural                      on the exterior of the building. Each mural depicts an important                      facet of South Dakota living. These murals require thousands                      of bushels of corn, grain, grasses, wild oats, brome grass,                      blue grass, rye, straw and wheat each year. The exterior decorations                      are completely stripped down and new murals are created annually.

A Native American prayer and blessing for the new sagebrush plants to grow and for those who planted them to grow as well in their future endeavors - capped off three days of mine reclamation planting activities at TeckCominco American Incorporated’s (TCAI) Buckhorn Mine in Pine Valley approximately 50 miles southwest of Carlin, Nevada.   Work crews from the Nevada Division of Forestry planted approximately 8300 individual containerized sagebrush plants that were specially grown at a nursery operated by the Duckwater Shoshone Tribe about 35 miles south of Eureka, Nevada.  The planting was done on 43 acres of the 400-acre mine site being reclaimed.  Planting sagebrush helps restore the land to its former condition and maintain the wildlife habitat diversity that was there.   TCAI’s Buckhorn Mine had gold mining operations from 1984 to 1993 and since that time has been involved in reclamation activities on mine heap leach pads (where ore is treated with a cyanide solution, and gold extracted).      Establishment of sagebrush and other shrub species has traditionally been problematic on mine sites in this part of the Great Basin.  Previous attempts at planting containerized shrub seedlings from commercial sources yielded mediocre success (less than 5% survival).   In 2001, TCAI contacted the Duckwater Shoshone Tribe for help with native plants grown at their nursery.     The Duckwater Tribe’s nursery has used several techniques to improve sagebrush planting success.  One technique is to take crushed ore, also called ""growth material,"" from mine heap leach pads to the reservation and plant sagebrush in that soil to increase the reclamation success.  Another method the Duckwater Nursery uses is to start the seedlings in a green house and then transfer them outside where they can acclimatize or ""harden"" as they’re exposed to the elements.  It has been shown that by using the Duckwaters’s methods to germinate and acclimatize the shrubs, an 80% survival rate can be achieved.   Greg Schoen, Environmental Affairs Manager with TCAI and in charge of the reclamation project commented, ""The first time the Duckwater sagebrush seedlings were used for mine reclamation was within the past few years at Placer Dome.  We looked at areas on the Buckhorn mine site where it was appropriate to plant sagebrush.  The goal for the Buckhorn site is to plant 8000 to 10,000 seedlings per year for two or three years.  Four different varieties of sagebrush are being planted.  As part of the overall reclamation of the site, there will also be riparian planting and forbs in the future.""      ""Mine reclamation begins the day mining operations begin,"" continued Schoen. ""The cooperation between the Duckwater Tribe and the mine has been excellent.  Part of our company’s philosophy is that we’re committed to sustainable development and we want to help the Duckwater keep their business growing.  These types of businesses are part of the economic ripple effect of the mine.""  ""The planting effort ties to BLM’s Great Basin Restoration Initiative and the Governor’s Sage Grouse Plan.  It’s a win/win for everyone – for the mine, for the Duckwater Tribe, and for BLM,"" Schoen concluded.  Kip McAlexander, nursery manger for the Duckwater Shoshone said, ""We received a USDA Rural Development grant to help get the nursery business started and now we’re in the third year of production.  One of our biggest markets is mining reclamation in the Great Basin.  There’s a real demand for the use of native seed and seedlings.  We’ve had a lot of support from the mining industry.""  ""In addition to serving the mines, we’re also working with Dick Beeman of the Santa Rosa Seed Company in Orovada, Nevada,"" McAlexander said. ""Beeman served as the ‘planting boss’ on our project for TCAI at the Buckhorn site.  Santa Rosa Seed and the Duckwater Tribe are working towards establishing a joint venture where the two entities can provide a more complete reclamation and seed business for the mining industry and government agencies – something that is needed in the Nevada.""    Duckwater Tribal Manager Jerry Millett spoke about the Duckwater’s involvement in the effort, ""This is the type of project and business that fits with our way of life.  We were taught by our elders to use resources – but to put the land back the way it was.""  Chairperson of the Duckwater Shoshone Tribe Perline Thompson agreed with Millett and thanked everyone involved in the project.    BLM Elko Geologist and Buckhorn project coordinator Tom Schmidt summarized, ""The first sagebrush planting experiments using crushed ore from heap leach pads were done in the mid-1980s near the Buckhorn Mine site.  Those experiments showed it was possible to grow sagebrush directly in the processed ore.""   ""We’re more than pleased with the efforts of TCAI to reclaim the site and with the planting of the Duckwater’s sagebrush seedlings,"" continued Schmidt.  ""In 1999, TCAI received BLM’s Legacy of the Land Award from BLM Director Tom Frye for cleaning up and reclaiming the nearby historic Red Springs Adit – a mining site from early 1900s.  TCAI cleaned up the site even though it was not their responsibility.""   After a barbeque lunch catered by TCAI, a dozen Duckwater Shoshone children and Tribal officials planted the last sagebrush seedlings for 2003.         -blm-   This is a U.S. Government Computer System.

GX019-94-4921907	"|  Index  |  Abstract  |  Introduction  |  Summary of Alternatives and Impacts  |  Tables  |  Maps  |  Libraries  |  PDF File  |  Comments  |                                        SUMMARY OF ALTERNATIVES AND IMPACTS    FEATURES COMMON TO ALL ALTERNATIVES    This environmental impact statement evaluates seven alternatives for the long-term management of bison. Alternative 1 is the no-action alter native (continue with existing interim plan), and alternative 7 (manage for specific bison popula tion range) is the agencies' preferred alternative at this time. Each of the seven alternatives has several features in common, including the following:     All alternatives require the cooperation of the state of Montana, the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.     Every alternative envisions the bison population would be managed primarily through natural processes inside Yellowstone National Park.     In all alternatives (except alternative 5 in the short term), the use of lethal controls to manage bison is minimized as the population size approaches 1,700 animals.     All alternatives include large geographic areas where bison are able to range with little human intervention. In alternative 5, this area is limited to Yellowstone National Park.      Monitoring is an integral part of every alternative, especially as bison approach designated border areas in Montana.     All alternatives define a management boundary beyond which agencies would take action to ensure bison do not remain.     If a capture facility is sited as part of an alternative, it would meet certain environ mental criteria and comply with requirements of the Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act before construction began.     All alternatives include humane treatment of bison held in capture or quarantine facilities.     All alternatives except alternative 5 allow bison outside the park. To do so and not affect Montana's class-free status, special management areas (SMAs) would be created. The creation of these SMAs would not require changes to current APHIS regula tions, but would require the approval of the state of Montana as specified by Montana law.     Slaughtered bison could be auctioned or distributed to social service organizations. Bison shot in the field may be released to tribes. Live bison would be available if they had completed the approved quarantine protocol.     In Montana, private landowners may shoot bison on their land with permission from the Department of Livestock, or they may ask the department to remove bison.      All alternatives include the suggested vaccination of female cattle calves in areas adjacent to the park or in SMAs, as well as surveillance testing of these herds should contact with bison be suspected or occur. All alternatives also assume vaccination of bison calves and captured adult bison when a safe and effective vaccine is available.     All alternatives include future research efforts.    ALTERNATIVE 1: NO ACTION -CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT INTERIM BISON MANAGEMENT PLAN    Adopting this alternative would continue current bison management as set forth in the 1996  Interim Bison Management Plan  as defined by National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) guiding regulations (40 CFR 1502.14). Theinterim plan relies on strict border enforcement to keep bison and cattle separate, and has no provision for the quarantine of bison. Bison are prevented from crossing the northern park boundary at Reese Creek because the adjacent land is private and occupied by cattle throughout the year. All bison captured at the Stephens Creek facility are shipped to slaughter.     Bison are allowed in the Eagle Creek/Bear Creek area, a large tract of public (U.S. Forest Service) land north and east of Reese Creek. The Department of Livestock, with help from the agencies, maintains a boundary at Little Trail Creek/Maiden Basin hydrographic divide in the Eagle Creek/Bear Creek area. Bison moving north of this boundary and approaching private land in the Gardiner area are removed by agency personnel with the permission of the landowner.    In the West Yellowstone area, public lands administered by the U.S. Forest Service are adjacent to the park. Cattle are more dispersed than at Reese Creek and are not grazed during the winter months. Up to 50-100 seronegative nonpregnant bison in the West Yellowstone area are able to overwinter successfully outside the park without coming in contact with cattle. Seropositive, untested, or any pregnant bison are removed. Bison are excluded from the West Yellowstone area from May through October to prevent contact while cattle occupy the region. Bison located outside the park in the west boundary area would be hazed back into the park in the spring, 30 to 60 days before cattle occupy the area. The exact number of days, between 30 and 60, would be at the discretion of the state veterinarian. Those bison that could not be hazed back into the park would be shot. In addition, a handful of bison (usually single bulls) use the Cabin Creek/Lee Metcalf area on the west, or Hellroaring and Slough drainages to the north and east of Eagle Creek/Bear Creek. Those few that do move beyond the borders of either of these large tracts of public land would be hazed or shot.    Although agencies have made subsequent changes to the interim plan, these are not reflected in the description or analysis of the no-action alternative. In other words, existing conditions were assumed to begin when the analysis in this environmental impact statement began in spring 1997.    ALTERNATIVE 2: MINIMAL MANAGEMENT    The purpose of this alternative is to restore as near-natural conditions as possible for bison, including a small portion of their historic nomadic migration patterns. The area outside Yellowstone National Park over which bison would be able to range (e.g., the SMAs) without interference from agencies is the largest of all alternatives.    In each alternative, including alternative 2, many changes, such as land acquisition, changes in cattle operations, and a safe and effective bison vaccine, are described. Each of these involves some unknowns, as well as time to implement. Therefore, until these changes were in place, relevant management tools in the interim plan would remain in effect. The description below assumes these changes have been made.     The primary means to minimize the risk of disease transmission would be changes in cattle operations in the SMAs. This alternative would provide for lethal control of bison only in cases where human safety was in immediate danger, on private property at the request of the landowner, or outside the SMA border. Bison would not be captured or slaughtered by agencies. A key tool available to restore natural conditions and help control bison distribution would be the closure (e.g., discontinuing grooming) of winter groomed roads in Yellowstone National Park that the animals now use to traverse the park. Bison have ""discovered"" these pathways from the interior to both the northern and western boundaries of the park, and can use them routinely during the winter to access areas they would otherwise have more difficulty reaching. It is hypothesized that the energetic cost of traveling long distances on groomed roads would be low, and they in effect could be allowing bison to access other foragingareas, leave the interior, and move to boundary areas. Alternative 2 would be the only alter native to propose changes in winter operations in some segments of park roads to control bison distribution, although other alternatives include research on the use of roads and potential barriers to bison travel (alternative 3), and plowing to access capture facilities (alternatives 5 and 6).    In addition to leaving road segments ungroomed, the agencies would maintain boundary lines through hazing and shooting. Landowners could request bison on their property be removed, or could shoot them with permission of the Montana Department of Livestock. Cattle operators on private lands inside designated SMAs might be offered incentives to remove susceptible (breeding) cattle, or grazing rights, easements, or property in bison winter range might be purchased from willing sellers to remove cattle altogether. In addition, public grazing allotments might be modified to accommodate bison.    ALTERNATIVE 3: MANAGEMENT WITH EMPHASIS ON PUBLIC HUNTING    Alternative 3 would rely on hunting of bison to regulate population numbers and distribution of bison outside the park, and on separation of bison in time and space to preclude contact of bison with cattle. Where hunting was infeasible or inappropriate, capture and shipment of sero positive bison to slaughter and seronegative bison to quarantine would be used to maintain separation and manage the risk of disease transmission. As in other alternatives, bison would be vaccinated when a safe and effective vaccine was developed to further reduce this risk. This alternative would have both a distinct short-term (phase 1) and a long-term (phase 2) management strategy.    In the short term, the separation of cattle and bison on the northern (Reese Creek) boundary would be maintained through capture at Stephens Creek and the shipment of sero positives to slaughter and seronegatives toquarantine (or slaughter until the quarantine facility was built). Under the provisions of the interim management plan, the agencies now ship some of the bison captured at Stephens Creek to slaughter. A quarantine facility would give the agencies flexibility in the disposition of seronegative bison they do not now have.    Bison that completed the entire quarantine procedure would be shipped live to requesting tribes or organizations, or used to repopulate herds on public lands. The location, design, and operation of a quarantine facility has not been determined, and an appropriate range of alternatives with different features would be evaluated before one was built. Additional NEPA and other compliance would be required to build such a facility on federal land or use federal money. Until the time a quarantine facility was constructed (assumed for the purposes of analysis to begin in 1999), all seronegative bison captured at Stephens Creek would be sent to slaughter.    The Department of Livestock, with help from the agencies, would maintain a boundary at Little Trail Creek/Maiden Basin hydrographic divide similar to alternative 1. Bison moving north of this boundary would be removed by agency personnel with the permission of the landowner.    Bison would be hazed back into the park in the spring, 30 to 60 days before cattle occupy the area. The exact number of days, between 30 and 60, would be at the discretion of the state veterinarian. Those bison that could not be hazed back into the park would be shot. As in alternatives 1 and 4, agencies would also maintain a boundary at the north end of the Cabin Creek Recreation and Wildlife Manage ment Area/Monument Mountain Unit of the Lee Metcalf Wilderness. Hunting would be used in both the Eagle Creek/Bear Creek and western SMAs to help control population numbers and distribution. Research on the degree to which the winter grooming of park roads contributed to migration out of the park would continue, and changes in road grooming practices would be made in the long term if research showed theywere warranted. These changes would be implemented through amendments to the park's winter use plan and appropriate NEPA documentation.    In the long term, alternative 3 would call for acquisition of bison winter range through purchase of grazing rights, easements, or property from willing sellers, alterations in cattle allotments, and/or changes in livestock opera tions to remove susceptible cattle. This newly acquired winter range would be designated as the Reese Creek SMA, and would include lands on the west side of the Yellowstone River between Reese Creek and Yankee Jim Canyon. If suitable land north of the park was acquired through purchase or easement, the Stephens Creek capture facility might be moved to a different location. The Department of Livestock, with help from the agencies, would maintain a boundary at Yankee Jim Canyon, and hunting in the Reese Creek SMA would be used to help control population size and distribution of the bison herd.    If this alternative was selected, the agencies would request the 1999 Montana Legislature to authorize a fair-chase hunt for bison. Public hunting would then become the primary tool for agencies to control population sizes in the new Reese Creek SMA, and would also be allowed in the Eagle Creek/Bear Creek area and western SMA.    Modifications in grazing allotments, acquisition or easement of private land, or conversion from cow-calf to steer or spayed heifer production are options in this alternative for the West Yellowstone area to further reduce the risk of bison commingling with susceptible cattle.    ALTERNATIVE 4: INTERIM PLAN WITH LIMITED PUBLIC HUNTING AND QUARANTINE    The interim plan (no action, or alternative 1 in this analysis) has served to ensure spatial separation of the bison herd from domestic cattle on the northern and western borders of Montana.However, it has given agencies few options when harsh winters force more than the average number of bison toward the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park. For this reason, alternative 4 includes a quarantine facility to preserve seronegative bison captured at Stephens Creek. Bison completing the quarantine protocol would be released to tribes, requesting organi zations, or to repopulate herds on public lands. The location of the facility has not been deter mined, and locating it on federal land or using federal money would mean subsequent NEPA analysis, including public input, would be required.    Hunting, should it be approved by the Montana Legislature, would be another tool proposed to help agencies control population numbers and distribution. A limited hunt, primarily for recreation, would be allowed in the West Yellowstone and Eagle Creek/Bear Creek areas.    Except for these differences, alternative 4 would be identical to the interim management plan, alternative 1.    ALTERNATIVE 5: AGGRESSIVE BRUCELLOSIS CONTROL WITHIN YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK THROUGH CAPTURE, TEST, AND REMOVAL    This alternative would implement an aggressive three-year capture and test program for all bison in the park, including those in its interior. Those testing negative would be released in the park, and seropositives would be shipped to slaughter. If a safe and effective vaccine was available, seronegative bison would also be vaccinated. Bison would not be allowed outside the park anywhere in Montana, and agencies would maintain northern and western boundaries. Bison at these boundaries would be hazed back into the park if possible, but shot if they were unresponsive to hazing. Capture facilities would be set up in nine areas. All untested bison would be shot in the latter stages of the capture, test, and slaughter program. When subsequent testing indicated brucellosis had been eradicated fromthe bison population, a new bison management plan would be prepared.    ALTERNATIVE 6: AGGRESSIVE BRUCELLOSIS CONTROL WITHIN YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK THROUGH VACCINATION      This alternative, like alternative 5, would pursue the aggressive reduction of brucellosis from the Yellowstone bison herd. However, the entire bison herd would first be vaccinated (when a safe and effective vaccine was available), primarily through remote means, and tested as they attempted to exit at park boundary locations. When tests showed the incidence of exposure to  B. abortus  had stabilized as a result of vaccination, (estimated to occur in 10 years) the herdwide capture, test, and slaughter of seropositive bison outlined in alternative 5 would begin.     Unlike alternative 5, bison would be allowed in the Eagle Creek/Bear Creek and western SMAs, although the majority of bison in the western SMA would be tested and released sero negatives. The National Park Service would construct and operate a capture facility at Seven-Mile Bridge inside the park on the west side. Nearly all bison migrating toward the West Yellowstone area cross through this narrow area. These facilities (at Duck Creek and the Madison River) would be dismantled, although a small, backup capture facility near Horse Butte, might be maintained.    ALTERNATIVE 7: PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE - MANAGE FOR SPECIFIC BISON POPULATION RANGE    The preferred alternative departs from all other alternatives in that a range of bison population numbers would be the focus, and specific management scenarios would be put in place as the population approached either end of that range. This range would be from 1,700 to 2,500 bison. Agency controls would decrease as the bison population approached 1,700 and wouldcease at 1,700 bison in certain areas as described in management sections for each area. Additional measures to remove increasing numbers of bison would be implemented near the 2,500 mark if bison left the park or SMAs described in this alternative. Because bison removals occur at or outside the park boundary, the bison population could at times exceed 2,500 inside the park.    In the long term, the agencies might acquire access to additional winter range in the Gardiner Valley on the west side of the Yellowstone River through purchase of grazing rights, easements, or property from willing sellers. If acquired, this tract would be designated an SMA subject to the approval of the state of Montana as specified by Montana law. The capture facility now located at Stephens Creek could be dismantled and moved to an appropriate location in the SMA. No modifications in grazing allotments or acquisitions of property, easements, or grazing rights in the western SMA would be anticipated.    Although the preferred alternative (alternative 7) is distinct, it has elements similar to other alternatives. Capture and slaughter of seropositives would be the primary means of managing risk, as it is in alternatives 1, 4, and 5. Most seronegative bison would be shipped to quarantine, as described in alternative 4. Also like alternative 4, low levels of hunting would be allowed in one or more of the SMAs outside the park. As in alternative 3, the preferred alternative has a long-term phase that proposes the acquisition of winter range north of the park boundary. However, as described above, this alternative is much more specific in defining a population size and management tools to keep it at that size. It is also true that alternatives 1 through 6 are unique, as each emphasizes a particular strategy to manage bison or combination of strategies not analyzed in alternative 7.       Stephens Creek capture facility.    IMPACTS ON BISON POPULATION    A simple model based on averages (deter ministic) was used to predict changes in bison populations and/or seroprevalence rates should a given alternative be implemented. Because a single severe winter, such as the 1996-97 winter, could alter estimates of bison numbers significantly, the analysis also includes a section on the effects of small, average, and large-scale migrations out of the park in response to these ""stochastic"" events on the population size.     The deterministic model predicts the continued implementation of alternative 1 would result in a growing bison population. From 1997 to 2006, the bison population would increase at 4% per year to approximately 3,100. Management actions in this alternative would not measurably affect the age/sex distribution or reproductive rates of bison in this or any alternative except for alternative 5. Bison distribution outside the park is indicated in chart 1. In this, and all other alternatives except alternative 5, 100-200 bison would freely range on public lands in the Eagle Creek/Bear Creek area.    Alternative 2 would result in the largest and fastest growth of the bison population of all alternatives. From 1997 to 2006, the population is expected to increase to 3,500, moderately more bison (14%) than in alternative 1.    Alternative 3 would result in growth of the bison population, with numbers controlled primarily through hunting. From 1997 to 2006, the bisonpopulation would be expected to increase from about 2,200 to 3,500 (average increase 6%/year). Limited capture operations, agency shooting, hunting, and periodic severe environmental conditions would likely maintain the bison population near the upper management range of 1,700 to 3,500. It is estimated that alternative 3 would result in moderately more bison in the population (14% increase) compared to alternative 1.     In alternative 4, bison population numbers would be controlled through capture, shipment of seropositive bison to slaughter, and hunting. This alternative would result in a slowly increasing bison population with lower popula tion numbers than alternatives 1, 2, 3, or 6. From 1997 to 2006, the bison population would be expected to increase from about 2,200 bison to 2,800 (average increase 3%/year). This would be a minor decrease (8% lower) in bison population size relative to alternative 1.    For alternative 5, the bison population would be expected to decline from 2,200 bison to approximately 1,250 bison by 1999. The bison population would be expected to number approximately 2,000 by 2006, and approxi mately 2,900 bison by 2011, 10 years after capture, test, and slaughter operations have ceased. No bison would be expected in Reese Creek, Eagle Creek/Bear Creek, or West Yellowstone in this alternative. The bison population would experience a major decrease in this alternative, representing a nearly 47% reduction, compared to alternative 1, over a period of only three years.    No bison would be allowed anywhere outside Yellowstone National Park boundaries under alternative 5. Management actions in alternative 5 could affect the age/sex distribution or repro ductive rate of the bison population. Bison distribution within the park would likely be affected, and several areas would likely have few or no bison for as long as 10 years.    In alternative 6, all bison would be vaccinated for approximately 10 years (beginning in the year 2000) to reduce seroprevalence in thepopulation. After whole herd vaccination, bison would be captured, tested, and seropositives slaughtered, similar to alternative 5. Two different estimates of population size were calculated based on the effectiveness of the vaccine. Assuming a 70% effectiveness, the bison population would be expected to increase during the vaccination phase from 2,200 bison to approximately 3,500 bison in 2010, a negligible to minor increase compared to alternative 1. After 10 years of vaccination (2010), capture and slaughter would begin, and the population would drop from 3,500 to about 2,900 in a single year, a moderate (17%) decrease compared to alternative 1. If the vaccine was only 25% effective, the population would drop from 3,500 animals in 2010 to 2,500 the following year, when parkwide capture and slaughter began. This would represent a major short-term adverse impact (28% reduction) on the population. The herd would begin to increase following completion of the test and slaughter program; from 2,900 to 3,400 bison by 2014 (assuming 70% effectiveness), or from 2,500 to about 3,000 animals (assuming 25% effectiveness) by 2014.    Unlike other alternatives, in alternative 7 the agencies would attempt to manage the bison population within the more narrow range of 1,700 to 2,500 animals. Given the mix of management tools described above in ""The Alternatives,"" the model predicts the bison population would be expected to increase from about 2,200 bison to 2,700 (average increase 2.6%/year) in 2004, and level off at or about 2,700 throughout the remainder of the 15-year plan. This alternative would result in a bison population 12% lower than alternative 1 in 2006 and 23% lower in 2011. However, because of limitations with the deterministic model, the differences between alternatives 1 and 7 might be less. Slaughter, quarantine, agency shooting, and hunting are predicted to remove an average of 132 to 137 bison per year. If bison exited the park in larger numbers during severe winters, more would be killed if the bison population was near or above 2,500 animals. During mild winters, fewer bison would exit the park and thus fewer bison would be killed.     Stochastic Influence on Bison Population    Chart 2 indicates how alternatives would vary in handling a large migration (975 bison) out of the park in response to a stochastic or periodic event, such as severe winter weather. Additional removals might include shipment of sero negative bison to slaughter or quarantine, or additional agency shooting or increases in the number of hunting permits issued, and would depend on the bison management tools available in a given alternative. Each action assumes all elements of the alternative would be in place (e.g., phase 2 of the alternative).    Seroprevalence Rate    Modeling efforts for this environmental impact statement assumed 50% seroprevalence in the bison population. The model also assumed either a 70% rate of effectiveness of the bison vaccine (based on current success with cattle) or 25% rate of effectiveness (based on effectiveness in bison calves). Bison calves were assumed to be vaccinated with a safe and effective vaccine beginning in 2000.    Assuming a vaccine that was 70% effective and calfhood vaccinations began in 2000, the population seroprevalence rate under alternative 1 would be expected to decline from a starting point of 50% seropositive in 1997 to at least 33% seropositive in 2006 (see chart 3). If the vaccine was 25% effective, seroprevalence was predicted to drop from 50% to 40% by 2006. Continued management efforts and calfhood vaccination (assuming 70% efficacy) would reduce seroprevalence to 24% in 2011.    In alternative 2, the population seroprevalence rate would be expected to decline to at least 34% seropositive in 2006 (assuming 70% efficacy) or to 42% by 2006 (assuming 25% efficacy). Continued management efforts and calfhood vaccination (70% efficacy) would reduce seroprevalence to 26% in 2011. This would represent a minor adverse impact (3% to 8% less reduction) compared to alternative 1.

Assumes all elements of the alternative were in place (phase 2).    c. If 975 bison were to exit the park, the possibility exists that some bison might move onto private land or attempt to move beyond SMA boundaries and be shot, if hazing were unsuccessful. Predicting the total number of bison that may move beyond the boundaries of the SMAs and be shot is not possible, but it might likely be greater than zero.    Chart 3: Predicted Seroprevalence Rates for Each Alternative Using Deterministic (Averaging) Model              Alternative       Seroprevalence     2006 (assuming 70% efficacy)       Seroprevalence     2006 (assuming 25% efficacy)       Seroprevalence     2011 (assuming 70% efficacy)                                 1                           33       40       24                                 2                           34       45       26                                 3                           36       45       28                                 4                           34       42       26                                 5                           0       0       0                                 6*                           32       40       0                                 7                           32       40       23          * For both vaccine efficacies, seroprevalence would be 0% after completion of capture, test, and slaughter operations by 2013.    In alternative 3, the population seroprevalence rate would be expected to decline to at least 36% seropositive in 2006, assuming a 70% vaccine efficacy. With calfhood vaccination and a vaccine efficacy of 25%, seroprevalence was predicted to drop to 45% by 2006. Continued management efforts and calfhood vaccination  (70% efficacy) would reduce seroprevalence to 28% in 2011. This would be a minor to moderately higher seroprevalence (9%-17% higher) than that predicted for alternative 1.    In alternative 4, capture and removal of sero positive bison, and calfhood vaccination (70% efficacy) was predicted to decrease sero prevalence to at least 34% in 2006 and 26% in 2011. Assuming a 25% vaccine efficacy, sero prevalence would drop to 42% by 2006. This would be a minor adverse impact (3%-5% higher seroprevalence) compared to alternative 1.    In alternative 5, the seroprevalence rate in bison would be expected to drop from 50% in 1997 to 0% in 2001, assuming 70% vaccine efficacy, capture, test, slaughter operations, and whole-herd vaccination. In the 25% vaccine efficacy model the seroprevalence rate dropped to 0% by 2001. This would be a significant decrease in the seroprevalence rate and a major beneficial impact compared to alternative 1.     In alternative 6, the seroprevalence rate would remain similar to alternative 1 during the vaccination phase (2000-2010), and then drop to 0% by 2013. This would be a major reduction in seroprevalence compared to alternative 1.    In alternative 7, the population seroprevalence rate would be expected to decline from a starting point of 50% seropositive in 1997 to at least 32% seropositive in 2006 due to removal of seropositive bison leaving Yellowstone National Park in the West Yellowstone and Reese Creek area, and calfhood vaccination (70% efficacy) beginning in 2000. Continued management efforts and calfhood vaccination (70% efficacy) would reduce seroprevalence to 23% in 2011. With calfhood vaccination and a vaccine efficacy of 25%, seroprevalence was predicted todrop from 50% to 40% by 2006. This would be a negligible to minor beneficial impact (0-4% lower seroprevalence rate) compared to alternative 1.    IMPACTS ON RECREATION    United States citizens and people from all over the world spend more than 9 million visitor days of recreation in developed sites of the Yellowstone area each year. In Yellowstone National Park, recreational visitation has grown by more than 25% in the last 14 years. As is common in most other western national parks, visitor use in Yellowstone is concentrated in the summer months, with 66% of the visitation in June, July, and August. By the year 2003, estimated visitation is expected to range from 3.6 million to 4.3 million visitors per year (NPS 1994a). An additional nearly 2.8 million recreation visitor days on the adjacent Gallatin National Forest were logged in 1992.     Wildlife and Bison Viewing    When Yellowstone National Park was set aside in 1872 as the world's first national park, the ""wonders of the Yellowstone"" were the primary motivation - spectacular geysers, colorful hot pools, and the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone (Meagher 1974). However, in modern times, wildlife viewing is the primary activity for many visitors who come to Yellowstone National Park. Bison are ranked as one of the top 10 animals visitors hope to see on a visit to the park.     Increases and reductions in bison numbers in and around the park could directly affect visitor wildlife-viewing experiences. Alternative 1 would lead to a moderate growth in bison numbers over the next 10 years (42% increase in population by 2006). Alternatives 2 and 3 populations would be 14% greater than alter native 1 populations and lead to a minor to moderate increase in viewing opportunities. Alternative 4 would be expected to result in a population of 2,812 bison in 2006. This is 8% smaller than under alternative 1 and would leadto a minor decrease in viewing opportunities. Alternative 5 would lead to a 35% decrease in bison populations compared to alternative 1 by 2006 and a moderate to major adverse impact on associated viewing opportunities. Alternative 6 would lead to very similar populations as alternative 1 through 2009 until seroprevalence stabilizes from vaccination (estimated at roughly 10 years), then would reduce them temporarily by 17%, a minor to moderate adverse impact. Alternative 7 calls for the lowest long-range (15+ years) bison population of all the alternatives. By 2006, the population would be nearly 23% lower. These reductions in population size would likely lead to minor to moderate reductions in bison viewing opportunities relative to alternative 1.    Winter Recreation    Winter use in the park has been growing at an accelerating rate, nearly doubling in the decade between 1984 and 1994, to 140,000 in the 1994-95 winter season. An estimated 46% of winter visitors liked viewing the scenery most, and 17% specifically identified wildlife viewing as what they liked most about the park in the winter (NPS 1990b). In addition, snowmobiling has become a popular sport in the town of West Yellowstone.     Winter recreational use of Yellowstone National Park would be affected under alternatives 2, 5, and 6. Alternative 2 would lead to long-term closure of winter access to the park from the popular snowmobiling town of West Yellowstone and possibly restrict access from Mammoth to the park interior. Proposed alternative 2 road and trail closures would likely affect well over 50% of current winter oversnow visitors to the park, and either displace their activities to other roads and trails in the area or cause them to go to areas other than Yellowstone for winter recreation. Alternative 2 would likely have a minor to moderate effect on winter recreation users in the Yellowstone region. During the three to four years of capture and slaughter operations, alternative 5 would have a higher negative impact on winter recreation thanalternative 2 in that the west, north, and east entrances would all be cut off from winter access to the popular Old Faithful area. For the first 10-12 years alternative 6 would have similar negative impacts on winter recreation to alternative 2. During the following two to three years, the impacts on winter recreation under alternative 6 would be similar to those for the capture and slaughter period of alternative 5.     Hunting    The five-week elk general rifle season in the study area takes place in late October and November. Mean harvest of elk in and near the affected environment is 3,044. By comparison, deer harvest is 2,564, moose is 93, bighorn sheep is 22, mountain goat is 10, and pronghorn is 23.    The American bison is a trophy animal for big-game hunters. Bison hunting takes place on both public lands and private game ranches in North America. Private ranches charge relatively high prices (ranging from $2,250 to $4,000 in the Northern Rocky region) for hunting a trophy-sized bull.    Limited hunting of bison would be allowed under alternatives 3, 4, and 7. Under alternative 3 between 75 and 85 bison hunting permits would be issued per year. Under alternative 4 the number of permits would be approximately 35. Under alternative 7 between 25 and 35 permits would be issued. This change in hunting oppor tunities in the area would represent a minor increase in overall big game hunting in the Greater Yellowstone Area, but would be a minor to moderate benefit for those receiving permits. No hunting of bison would occur under alternatives 1, 2, 5, or 6.    IMPACTS ON LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS    In the Yellowstone area, the livestock industry is composed mainly of cow-calf operations with the exception of a few sheep producers. Cow-calf pairs are grazed on national forest allot ments that can include adjacent private land, and on private holdings not associated with grazing allotments. In addition to risks of disease transmission, bison can harm livestock, as well as damage structures.    To the north of Yellowstone National Park, grazing allotments located in the broadest area included in this environmental impact statement have about 434 cow-calf pairs on national forest land and about 191 pairs on adjacent private land included as part of the allotments. When only the Reese Creek area is considered, cow-calf pairs on national forest land number about 86, with about 130 pairs on allotted private land. In the West Yellowstone area, about 364 cow-calf pairs are grazed on national forest land in the Horse Butte and Wapiti areas. An additional 128 pairs (and 2 pairs on allotted private land) are found on allotments to the west and south of Hebgen Lake.       Cattle near Whitehall, Montana, by G. Wunderwald. (NPS photo)    Privately owned lands that are not part of allotments include both livestock holdings and nonranch residences. North of Yellowstone National Park, the largest of the livestock operations is in the Reese Creek area on the Royal Teton Ranch. It has about 100 cow-calf pairs on unallotted private land, in addition to 150 on allotted private and public land.    In the West Yellowstone area, there are four private holdings located in the Horse Butte region between Duck Creek and the Madison River, totaling about 1,250 acres. Only the largest, with an area of about 650 acres, has asummer cattle operation with about 215 cow-calf pairs. Including producers to the west and south of Hebgen Lake, there are an estimated 800 cow-calf pairs on private land in the West Yellowstone area that could be directly affected by the most extensive of the SMAs (alternative 2).    Altogether, publicly and privately grazed cattle to the north and west of Yellowstone that could be directly affected are estimated to total about 2,019 cow-calf pairs. They comprise less than 4% of the cattle population of Gallatin and Park Counties.    The impacts of brucellosis on livestock operations involve not only the area adjacent to Yellowstone National Park, but also producers throughout Montana. The threat of disease transmission and the economic effects of disease-exposed bison entering the state have potential impacts that could indirectly affect all producers in the state.    Under alternative 1, cattle producers near Yellowstone National Park currently take precautions against the threat of brucellosis by vaccinating all female calves. In addition, herds from Idaho that graze in the West Yellowstone area are tested both when entering and leaving Montana. The cost of vaccinating and testing is relatively minor, estimated at about 2% of average yearly cow-calf production costs in the western United States. Producers' perceptions of the potentially negative consequences of grazing near Yellowstone National Park underlie recent decisions by two purebred stock owners to no longer graze their cattle in the area.     Alternative 2, characterized by minimal bison management, would involve modification of grazing allotments on the national forest, acquisition or easement of private lands, and conversion of cow-calf operations to steer or spayed heifer production. In the short term, until these changes are accomplished, the interim plan would continue. Public funds would be required for compensating producers who agreed to convert their operations and for acquiring the title or use of the private properties. Thesetransactions would be voluntary with fair remuneration. Nevertheless, they would represent major impacts for the producers involved. Modification of public grazing allotments could affect as many as 926 cow-calf pairs. Incidents of damage by bison would be similar to occurrences under alternative 1 until susceptible cattle were removed from the areas designated as SMAs. Afterward, incidents would be fewer, since the only cattle would be those on converted holdings. Producers near SMA boundaries would likely continue to vaccinate female calves.    Under alternative 3, testing and vaccinating would continue as under the interim plan (alternative 1) in the short term. In the long term, modifications in grazing allotments on the national forest as described under alternative 2 would reduce the need for vaccinating and testing, but within less extensive SMAs. Producers near SMA boundaries would likely continue to vaccinate female calves. Whereas about 2,019 cow-calf pairs are found within the areas designated to be SMAs under alternative 2, the smaller areas of alternative 3 contain about 895 cow-calf pairs. Moderate to major impacts in the long term for these herds would result from possible conversion to steer or spayed heifer enterprises, closure or modification of grazing allotments, and private land acquisitions. Hunting could provide a minor source of income for remaining converted holdings.    Alternative 4 differs from alternative 1 in that bison hunting would be allowed. Hunting in the West Yellowstone area could provide a minor source of income for some private holdings.    Under alternative 5, livestock operators in the vicinity of Yellowstone National Park would likely perceive a reduced disease threat because no bison would be allowed outside the park. Restriction of bison to the park would lessen concerns over brucellosis transmission, although vaccination of cattle could continue, especially in the short term. Relaxation of testing practices in the West Yellowstone area would depend on changes in Idaho's agreement with Montana. Private grazing resources might increase in valuedue to reduced risks of disease spread and damage by bison. Thus, the overall impact on affected livestock producers could be moderately beneficial.    Consequences of alternative 6 with respect to testing and vaccinating would be the same as in alternative 1 during the first years of vaccination of Yellowstone bison. Once capture, test, and slaughter of bison were undertaken, conse quences for livestock producers would be like those of alternative 5, although seronegative bison would be allowed on public land in the West Yellowstone SMA. Cattle vaccination would probably continue, depending on producers' risk perceptions. Continued testing of herds in the West Yellowstone area would depend on Idaho's agreement with Montana. In the long term, moderate benefits overall would be realized under this alternative, as under alternative 5.     SMAs under phase 1 of the preferred alternative (alternative 7) would be the same as they are now under the interim plan (alternative 1). Testing and vaccinating would continue, as would possible incidents of damage by bison within the boundaries of the SMAs. No modifications of livestock operations would occur under phase 1. In phase 2 (following acquisition of winter range north of the Reese Creek boundary), impacts could affect at least one private holding and could modify three public grazing allotments along the western side of the Yellowstone River in the Gardiner Valley.    In addition to direct impacts on local producers outlined above, ranchers throughout the state could suffer from increased testing or vacci nating requirements or interstate sanctions should brucellosis be transmitted to Montana cattle. The possibility of such transmission and associated indirect impacts would be considered remote in all alternatives, although it would be slightly less in alternative 5, slightly greater in alternative 2, and roughly equal in the remaining alternatives.    IMPACTS ON SOCIOECONOMICS    Regional Economy    The affected area primarily encompasses two Montana counties, Park and Gallatin, and portions of Yellowstone National Park.     Throughout the Greater Yellowstone Area, public lands provide the basis for much of the economic activity in the region (recreation, mining, forestry, and agriculture). The area's overall economy has been changing for more than 20 years. The economy has shifted from commodity-extraction dependence to a more diversified economy based on recreation, tourism, and service industries. For example, between 1969 and 1989, more than 96% of all new jobs in the Greater Yellowstone Area came from sectors other than timber, mining, and agriculture (Rasker, Tirrell, and Kloepfer 1992).    Approximately 10% of Park County employ ment and 5% of Gallatin County employment is in the agriculture, forestry, and mining sectors. In addition, some component of employment in manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and services is derivative of activity in these resource-based sectors. Most jobs pertaining to the recreation and tourism industry are found in the retail trade and service sectors of a county's economy.    Recreation and tourism are significant to the economic viability of the area. Retail trade and services accounted for approximately 40%-45% of each county's earnings. These sectors, along with the government sector, have a strong tie to the region's resources and would likely continue to be important in sustaining segments of the economy of the Greater Yellowstone Area.     The alternatives described in this environmental impact statement would have the potential to affect jobs and income primarily through changes in visitation levels to Yellowstone National Park. Visitation levels could be affected by changes in winter road grooming, changes in wildlife viewing as a result of lowered popula tion levels of bison, or in response to tourismboycotts. Visitors to Yellowstone National Park from outside Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho spent an average of $840 during their trips (Duffield 1992).    Expenditures Related to Recreation.  A 1994 report on snowmobiling in Montana found nonresidents spend approximately $40 million annually in the state, and three-fourths of those nonresidents spent time in or near West Yellowstone (Sylvester and Nesary 1994). If alternative 2, which would include closing roads now groomed for snowmobile use from West Yellowstone into the park was implemented, the annual loss in winter tourism expenditures in the town of West Yellowstone could be between $656,000 and $2 million. Under alternative 5 these regional annual losses could be $1.8 million to $3.2 million during the three to four years of road plowing (to pavement, and therefore unavailable for snowmobile use) for the capture and slaughter operations. Alternative 6 could lead to expenditure losses similar to those under alternative 2 for the first 10-12 years, and similar to those under alternative 5 for the next two to three years. The loss under all these alternatives would be substantially higher if not for considerable snowmobiling oppor tunities on the nearby national forest. Losses of winter recreation expenditures under alternatives 1, 3, 4, and 7 would probably be negligible. The adverse impacts on winter recreation expendi tures under alternative 2 could be more than offset by positive impacts on visitation related to wildlife viewing (see below). The adverse impacts on winter recreation expenditures under alternatives 5 and 6 would be in addition to adverse impacts on visitation related to wildlife viewing.    Resident elk hunters spent $54 per day while resident deer hunters spent $41 per day. Nonresident hunters expenditures associated with elk and deer hunting are $252 and $115 per day, respectively (Duffield 1988). Expenditures related to bison hunting in alternatives 3, 4, and 7 would add to this base, by as much as $440 per day. Since a maximum of 85 hunting permits for any alternative would be expected, expendituresrelated to it would be only a negligible benefit to the regional economy.    Expenditures Related to Wildlife Viewing.  Alternatives 2 and 3 would increase bison viewing opportunities, and alternatives 5, 6, and 7 would reduce them. The beneficial impact on the regional economy from alternatives 2 and 3 from increased visitor expenditures could be $20 million in annual park area visitor spending. Conversely, the adverse impact from alternatives 5, 6, or 7 could be $20 million in lost revenues from tourism.    The management of bison would involve killing through agency shooting, transport of sero positive animals to slaughter, hunting, and other actions that some would find objectionable. People who do take offense might object for any number of reasons: e.g., the killing of any animals is inappropriate, human management of wildlife is not needed, or bison do not need to be controlled to prevent brucellosis transmission from bison to cattle. All alternatives would involve bison management, and thus each would have some potential for adverse public reaction that might result in the call for a tourism boycott, although the potential would likely vary among alternatives. The potential for such a call and the effectiveness of such a boycott would be difficult to judge.    Minority and Low-Income Populations    As of the 1990 U.S. census, Park County had a per capita income of $11,378, approximately equal to that of the state of Montana. Gallatin County had a substantially higher income level of $17,032 per person. The percentage of the population in poverty across the two counties and the state was relatively consistent in 1990 at between 15.2% and 17.1%. Unemployment in the two counties in 1994 was below the state average of 5.1% (Park County, 4%; Gallatin County, 2.3%).     Montana's Native American population had a much lower per capita income ($5,422) than either the two counties or the state, a muchhigher percentage of population living in poverty (46.1%) than the counties or the state, and an unemployment rate (26.2%) much higher than the counties or the state.    Several area tribes have expressed interest in receiving bison carcasses, or, more importantly, live bison as seed stock from the Yellowstone herd to begin their own bison operations. Bison meat sells for nearly twice the cost of beef because it is considered a health food by some consumers.    Under the interim management plan, a total of 1,084 bison were killed outside the park in Montana in 1996-97. Of this total, 590 bison were shot on the spot and donated to charities or released to Native Americans in exchange for the labor of gutting, cleaning, and transporting carcasses. Charities received 77 bison, and Indian tribes, tribal members, and affiliated organizations received 513 bison (State of    Montana, C. Siroky, pers. comm. 1997).    Alternatives 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 all would include slaughter and the distribution of carcasses, and all alternatives would include provisions for shooting bison if they crossed boundary lines (and the subsequent gutting, cleaning, and distribution of carcasses, hides, and heads). The estimates for numbers of bison to be sold or donated for consumption would range from an incidental number per year in alternative 3 to 720 over four years under alternative 5. These numbers would represent a very minor portion of the total U.S. annual market for bison meat. The impact of charitable donations or release of carcasses to tribes would generally be negligible.    The release of live bison would require quarantining captured seronegative bison for the completion of a lengthy quarantine protocol. Quarantine facilities would be proposed for alternatives 3, 4, and 7, and live bison completing the procedure would be available to tribes and other requesting organizations. Live animals received after quarantine would have substantially more value to tribes than would carcasses.    Social Values    Bison are symbolically an icon for the independent, wild, and free American way of life, and are considered by some people to be ""a unique symbol of the strength and determination of the people of North America"" (National Bison Association 1997a).    Bison embody the culture of many native Plains peoples. They are a link to the spiritual world, spiritual power concentrated in physical form, the ""great provider,"" and ultimately a symbol of power and strength. Bison skulls are used as altars, bone is used on traditional dress, and they are at the heart of the continuing sun dance.       Bison are important to other groups as well. To hunters, they are a trophy animal; to cattle ranchers, bison have historically represented competition with livestock for limited forage; and to many animal rights activists, they are an aesthetic and historic resource.    Written comments collected from the  Interim Bison Management Plan/Environmental Assessment  in 1995 indicated the public was strongly against the slaughter of bison. Ranchers also indicated strong feelings on the need to protect cattle from brucellosis. These are moralistic-humanistic and utilitarian values, respectively. No systematic surveys have been conducted, but it appears that alternatives relying on slaughter (1, 4, 5, 6, and 7) would have a minor to major adverse impact on those having strong moralistic-humanistic values toward animals.    Attitudes in the Yellowstone region would be more balanced between utilitarian and other attitudes than in the nation as a whole (based on wolf recovery information). Native American values may be more complex, as many of the management actions are viewed as disrespectful or wasteful of bison.    Nonmarket Values    People place value on knowing a species is maintained in a viable state or has been augmented in some way. In a study involving elk winter range north of Yellowstone National Park, those surveyed found the benefit of a land purchase to benefit elk far outweighed actual land acquisition costs. This ""nonmarket"" or ""existence"" value applies to bison as well, and although no studies specific to bison were conducted, alternatives 2, 3, and 7 could potentially have large nonmarket value benefits associated with expansion of bison winter range, on the order of $1.6 to $22.9 million annually. Additional nonmarket values attributable to the opportunities to view natural wildlife popula tions, or for recreational opportunities, could also be in the millions of dollars.    Social Cost-Benefit    From a social cost-benefit perspective, alternatives 2, 3, and 7 would have the potential to range from a moderate negative to a major positive impact, while alternative 4 would likely have a minor adverse to negligible impact compared to alternative 1. Alternative 5 would likely have a major adverse impact, and the impact on alternative 6 could range from minor to moderate adverse.    From a regional economic perspective, alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would likely have a negligible to minor positive impact, while alternatives 5 and 6 would have a minor to moderate adverse impact. Regional economic impacts under alternative 7 would be expected to range from a moderately adverse effect to a minor positive impact.    IMPACTS ON THREATENED, ENDANGERED, AND SENSITIVE SPECIES    Peregrine falcons, bald eagles, grizzly bears, and gray wolves are the only known species to occur within the affected area that are protected by the Endangered Species Act. Wolverine, lynx, and trumpeter swan, USFS sensitive species, could also occur in the affected area. These species could be directly affected by bison management actions, such as shooting, hazing, or habitat loss or modification. Because bison are an important food source, predatory species could also be indirectly affected by reduced foraging oppor tunities caused by changes in bison numbers, distribution, and seasonal migration patterns.    Peregrine Falcons    The alternatives would have no effect on peregrines because bison management activities would not occur near active aerie or foraging areas, and because they do not feed on bison carrion.     Bald Eagles    Alternatives 5 and 6 would negatively affect bald eagles that winter and nest near Seven-Mile Bridge because of the location of a capture facility in this area. Other bald eagles in the analysis area would be protected by avoiding their nesting and wintering areas. Change in bison carrion availability would have a negligible effect because it is only a small part of the bald eagle diet.    Grizzly Bears     All alternatives could potentially disturb or displace grizzly bears from areas near bison management activities. The alternatives would affect only a small part of the Greater Yellowstone Grizzly Bear Recovery Zone, an area where seasonal or year-long grizzly activity is common and contains habitats important tothe recovery of grizzly bears. Denning bears would not be affected during the winter when most activities would occur. Under alternatives 3, 4, and 7, increased human activity could increase the probability for human/bear conflicts and bear mortality. This probability would be reduced to negligible by educating hunters, removing gut piles, and implementing other mitigating measures.    The degree to which an alternative modifies bison population numbers could likewise affect grizzly bears. Bison, along with other ungulates, rank as one of the highest sources of net digestible energy for grizzly bears in the Yellowstone ecosystem. Data indicate that 32% of all meat in the diet is carrion, and most of that is from adult bison. Bison are particularly important to bears because they provide a high quality food source during early spring before most vegetal foods are available to bears. Grizzly bears that den in the Pelican and Hayden Valleys in the park depend on bison carrion and are most likely to be affected by changes in bison populations.    Under alternative 1, bison numbers would not be maintained within a specific range, and low population levels could result during some periods. Consequently, foraging opportunities could be reduced during some years and negatively impact grizzly bears, particularly during the spring. This impact would likely be negligible unless bison disappeared from Pelican or Hayden Valleys in the park. Alternative 2 would allow the bison population to reach a long-term maximum of 3,500 bison quickly, and would leave park roads ungroomed, which would likely increase winter bison mortalities and carrion in the park. This would increase the availability of bison as a food source and moderately benefit grizzly bears. Alternative 3 would have minor benefits. Alternatives 4, 6, and 7 would maintain the bison populations within a specific range and cause only minor changes in the population. Thus, the impacts on grizzly bear foraging opportunities would be negligible. Alternative 5 would cause a major decrease in the first few years in the bisonpopulation and reduce the carrion supply available to grizzly bears.    Gray Wolves    The Rocky Mountain gray wolf was reintroduced in Yellowstone National Park in March 1995 and is part of a ""nonessential experimental population."" This means that the species is listed and protected under the Endangered Species Act, but agencies have additional flexibility in their management. To date nine packs are in the Greater Yellowstone Area, mostly in the park. Some individuals and packs have made exploratory movements outside the park, but none is resident outside the park.    All alternatives could disturb or displace wolves from areas near bison management activities. However, any impact on the small wolf popula tion would likely be negligible.    Wolves prey primarily on elk, moose, and deer. These species are abundant in the analysis area, and usually account for more than 90% of the biomass consumed. Smaller mammals may be an important alternative food during the snow-free months. Wolves rarely prey on live bison, but do eat bison carrion if it is available. Although wolves could eventually increase their take of bison as prey as the wolf population increased, impacts from changes in the bison population during the 15 years this plan was in effect would be negligible in alternatives 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7. Alternative 2 would have a moderate beneficial impact and alternative 5 a moderate to major adverse impact to wolves through larger-scale changes in bison population numbers.     On December 12, 1997, the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming ruled that the gray wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone National Park and northern Idaho violated one provision of the Endangered Species Act. The court ordered the federal government to remove the reintroduced wolves and their offspring. The court stayed the effect of the order pending appeals. Because the decision is on appeal, this document considers the graywolf as a permanent component of the study area. Should the decision be upheld on appeal and the wolves were removed, impacts on the gray wolf would not be an issue associated with bison management under the alternatives analyzed.    Wolverine and Lynx    Both wolverine and lynx are very susceptible to human activities, and wolverines readily abandon den sites when disturbed. All the alternatives could displace or disturb wolverine and lynx from areas near bison management activities. Under alternatives 2, 5, and 6, snowmobile use now on the groomed trails inside the park would be displaced to trails and off-trail areas in the neighboring Gallatin National Forest where wolverine and lynx occur. Lynx are specialized predators that may face competition from generalist predators given access to their habitat by following packed-snow routes such as those resulting from snowmobile use. Winter recreation activities would be monitored on the national forest and, if necessary, mitigating measures implemented to protect the wolverine and lynx. Changes in bison numbers would have a negligible impact because wolverine and lynx seldom feed on bison carrion.    Trumpeter Swans    Trumpeter swans could be affected by the location and operation of bison management facilities. The swan occupies meadows and open fields, plus lakes, ponds, or slow-moving water inside the park on the Madison River. In particular, a breeding pair at Seven-Mile Bridge where a capture facility is proposed in alternative 6, would experience major adverse impacts from construction and operation.    IMPACTS ON OTHER WILDLIFE SPECIES    Ungulates    The Stephens Creek capture facility occupies 13 acres of critical pronghorn winter range, and has had adverse impacts on the antelope population through displacement, disturbance, and blocked movements. Observations from capture operations during winter 1996-97 showed pronghorn avoided using habitat in the capture facility area, and some pronghorn may have been confused by the wing fences when fleeing from predators. The capture facility at Stephens Creek would continue to exist in all alternatives except alternative 2 (in the short term only in alternatives 3 and 7), and would have a moderate to major adverse impact on the pronghorn population. Other capture facilities, such as those in West Yellowstone and planned for different locations within the park in alternatives 5 and 6, could have minor adverse impacts on wildlife through displacement and disturbance.    Potential acquisition of additional wildlife winter range in the Gardiner Valley, a part of alter natives 2, 3, and 7, would make more winter habitat available to elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, and particularly pronghorn. This would be a minor benefit to most ungulates and a moderate to major beneficial impact on pronghorn.     Occasional hazing operations associated with all alternatives would be expected to have minor impacts on elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, and other ungulates through disturbance and temporary displacement.    In alternatives where snowmobile use would be displaced outside the park (alternatives 2, 5, and 6), impacts on ungulates outside the park could be more intense than they are now. This is because snowmobiles would be restricted to trails inside the park, but allowed to travel off trails in many areas of adjacent public lands.    Elk, pronghorn, deer, bighorn sheep, and moose would not likely be affected through competitionfor forage or space with bison, as each has an ecological niche that differs from bison through food choices, occupied habitat, or tolerance of snow depth. Therefore, increases or decreases in the bison population size would not be expected to affect any other large ungulates.     Predators and Scavengers    Hazing activities directed at moving bison into capture facilities or inside the SMA boundary could disturb and displace predator and scavenger species, including black bear, mountain lion, coyote, fox, wolverine, bobcat, lynx, and a variety of smaller mammalian and avian carnivores and scavengers using those areas. Hazing should be infrequent, however, and displacement and stress would be local and temporary and would have only minor effects on those populations. Changes in the bison population size and resulting availability of carrion would not affect predators and scavengers except during the parkwide capture and slaughter phases of alternatives 5 and 6, when reductions would be severe enough to cause a moderate impact. Displaced snowmobile use associated with alternatives 2, 5, and 6 might affect some of these species more severely than at present, as this activity is restricted to trails inside the park and might not be if it was displaced outside the park. Impacts on some species could be moderate.    IMPACTS ON HUMAN HEALTH    Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that can infect people, causing undulant fever. Symptoms include intermittent fever, chills, night sweats, body and joint pain, poor appetite, and weakness. The general public would be at no risk of contracting the disease from bison. However, people responsible for carrying out proposed bison management actions such as capturing, vaccinating, gutting, loading for slaughter, and laboratory analysis, could be at moderate risk. Hunters could also be at some risk. Recipients of auctioned or donated meat could be at minor risk of exposure through thehandling of potentially contaminated meat and the consumption of improperly prepared meat. Proper handling and cooking completely kills the bacteria.    Mitigating and preventive measures, such as proper equipment, ventilation, and information, would prevent impacts from being more than negligible to minor in all alternatives except during the parkwide capture and slaughter phases of alternatives 5 and 6, when the risk would be minor to moderate.    IMPACTS ON CULTURAL RESOURCES    The Great Plains and the northern Rocky Mountains of western Montana and Wyoming served as feeding grounds for bison. This region is also the homeland of various native peoples who hunted these herds.    Bison were critical to the indigenous cultures of North America and were an important part of the landscape covering over half the continent. They once ranged from the Appalachian Mountains to    the ""deserts"" of the Great Basin south into Mexico and as far north as the Yukon territory in Canada. English settlers arriving in what is now Georgia wrote of the ""innumerable"" bison they encountered. The numbers were so great that early Euro-American explorers could only describe them as ""numberless,"" and wrote that the plains were ""black and appeared to be moving"" with the herds of bison. The most commonly used estimates of their numbers were between 30 and 65 million.    Bison provided not only food, clothing, fuel, tools, and shelter, but also were central to Plains tribal spiritual culture, viewed as an earthly link to the spiritual world. For many tribes, bison represent power and strength. For example, the Shoshone believe that spiritual power is concen trated in the physical form of the bison. Many contemporary tribes maintain a spiritual connection with bison. Today, the InterTribal Bison Cooperative describes itself as ""tribes proudly serving the buffalo nation,"" indicating respect and a sense of equality and direct spiritual connection.      Illustration entitled ""By the Millions"" by Martin S. Garretson, 1913. (NPS photo)    Traditional use of bison by humans centers on hunting and is evidenced in the archeological record. The remains of game drives, including both the fences and bison jump sites, as well as chipping stations, wickiups, and weapons, are all associated with the importance of hunting bison for tribal economy and culture.    Most archeological sites in the Yellowstone area have not been evaluated according to the National Register of Historic Places criteria, although Obsidian Cliff, an area particularly rich in cultural remains, has been nominated as a national historic landmark. Several others, including the Yellowstone road system, one archeological site in the Stephens Creek area, and one archeological site in the Eagle Creek area, are considered to be eligible for inclusion in the national register.    In all alternatives, bison would be killed while occupying their historic range. Reductions in the population size compared to the no-action alternative (alternative 1) would occur on a short-term basis in alternatives 5 and 6, might occur on a short- term basis in alternative 4, and would occur on a long-term basis in alternative 7.    In all alternatives except alternative 2, the process of monitoring and vaccinating bison would change their appearance. Bison would be marked with visible metal ear tags, paper back tags, and paint/peroxide stripes to indicate to managers and others that they have tested negative for the  Brucella  organism. These actions alter the historic image of the bison and would have a temporary, moderate impact on the historic landscapes.    The construction of new capture or quarantine facilities would have the potential to affect archeological resources. In all alternatives proposing construction of bison management facilities (all except alternative 2), site-specific surveys would be conducted prior to ground-disturbing activities, and every effort would be made to avoid known archeological resources. Should avoidance prove impossible, the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, and state agencies would develop mitigating measures inconsultation with the state historic preservation officer and the advisory council. Therefore, the impact would likely be minor.     Removal of the capture facility at Stephens Creek, as proposed in alternative 2, would have a beneficial impact on the historic landscape. The construction of several new capture facilities in alternatives 5 and 6 would have a temporary but significant adverse impact on the historic landscape of Yellowstone National Park.    IMPACTS ON VISUAL RESOURCES    Visual resources consist of landform (topography and hydrology) and land cover (vegetation, buildings, roads, etc.). Visual resources are centered on significant features and intrinsic features. Also included is visibility of the undertaking, such as exposure and location.    The Greater Yellowstone Area is world renown for its scenery, wildlife, wilderness, rivers, fishing, hunting, outdoor recreation oppor tunities, and geologic and thermal features. The natural landscape is rugged and formidable due to the rapid gains in elevation, and most of the area remains in a wilderness state. Bison and other wildlife are frequently observed meandering through the landscape.    Visual resources within Yellowstone National Park fall into two general zones - the natural zone and the park development zone. Bison are observed within both, although they are most frequently observed within the natural zone.    Vehicle pullouts in the park are designed for visitors to stop and experience the visual resources, and are placed in areas where bison are most frequently found - e.g., valley low lands off the main loop roads. Some locations include the open areas within Hayden Valley, Old Faithful/Firehole area, the Madison River (past Seven-Mile Bridge), Indian Creek in the Mammoth area, the Norris Campground, Gibbon Meadows, Elk Park, and others. The view from these pullouts includes an unobstructed naturalsetting containing habitat desirable to bison as well as other wildlife species.    The process of capturing and/or vaccinating bison would temporarily change their natural appearance. Bison would be visibly marked with tags and peroxide stripes due to vaccination and testing procedures. These processing marks would detract from the natural appearance of the animal. This would be a short-term, moderately adverse impact on the viewer, photographer, and anyone interested in seeing bison. Capture would be a part of all alternatives except phase 2 of alternative 2.    Agency shooting of bison and some hazing operations would be visible if bison ventured beyond delineated management areas. Hunting of bison outside the park in designated SMAs is also part of alternatives 3, 4, and 7. These bison management actions would have a minor to major short-term (winter only) visual impact on the landscape, or on some viewers, who might be opposed to shooting, hunting, or hazing bison, or might be sensitive to these activities.     The existing capture and test facility would continue to intrude on the viewshed at Stephens Creek in all alternatives except alternatives 2, 3, and 7. Because this facility is of a compatible design with the nearby Yellowstone National Park wrangling facilities, the impact on visual resources would be minimal. Also, this facility would not be readily visible to the majority of visitors to the park and surrounding areas.    Capture and test facilities within the viewshed on the western boundary of Yellowstone National Park would continue to adversely impact visual resources in alternatives 1, 4, 6, and 7. The visual impact of capture facilities at West Yellowstone would be minor to moderate. These facilities would not be visible in major viewsheds, but some park visitors, national forest users, and local residents would see them. Bison management actions, such as hazing, shooting, and gutting, could be a major adverse visual impact on some of these viewers. Construction of capture and testing facilities in the Seven-Mile Bridge viewshed near thewestern boundary of the park in alternative 6 would be a major impact on visual resources.     The proposed construction of capture and test facilities within Yellowstone National Park at the Lamar Valley/Crystal Bench, Blacktail Plateau, Madison River, West Yellowstone boundary area, Old Faithful/Firehole River, and Hayden Pelican Valleys, which is part of alternatives 5 and 6, would have a major impact on visual resources. These areas are highly sensitive to visual intrusions, and while measures would be taken to minimize impacts, the presence of these facilities would be highly noticeable.    A quarantine facility is part of alternatives 3, 4, and 7. Although the location or design of a quarantine facility for bison has not been determined, the facility would probably appear as large-scaled corrals and pens within which bison would be visible. Siting of a relocated capture facility and a new quarantine facility would be sensitive to views and features of the viewshed; therefore, impacts are expected to be minor.    In alternatives 2, 3, or 7, grazing allotments might be modified and could cause negligible to minor changes in the rural landscape near park boundaries. In the long term, cattle grazing would be modified in some allotments on lands adjacent to Yellowstone National Park, and the scenery would change to views of bison and wildlife habitat.     Changes in the size of the bison population would affect viewers. Some would find increased opportunities to view bison a benefit; others opposed to wildlife management policies would be adversely affected.    Alternatives 2, 5, and 6 include provisions for closing roads to snowmobile traffic. This would help restore the winter visual scene inside the park to a more natural one, but would adversely affect visual resources on adjacent Gallatin National Forest where much of the snowmobile traffic would be displaced.       |  Index  |  Abstract  |  Introduction  |  Summary of Alternatives and Impacts  |  Tables  |  Maps  |  Libraries  |  PDF File  |  Comments  |"

Today's settlement, filed in U.S. District Court in Boise, resolves a lawsuit brought by Hussey in September 1995, over the death of his calf in January 1995.  In his lawsuit, Hussey alleged that the calf was killed by a grey wolf returned to the Idaho wilderness by the federal government.         The United States, based on medical evidence developed in the case, believes that the wolf did not kill the calf, but acknowledges that it did eat some of the calf after it was dead.  Based on these facts, the United States, although denying any responsibility for the death of the calf, agreed to pay Hussey $440 to cover a portion of the legal costs he incurred in resolving this matter.       The United States' Grey Wolf Reintroduction Program represents the culmination of a twenty year process attempting to recover the species in an area from which it was systematically eliminated.  The Reintroduction Program imported grey wolves from Canada and reintroduced them into two wilderness areas in the United States--the greater Yellowstone ecosystem and the Central Idaho Wilderness.                                ### 96-599

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensationsation             and Liability Act (CERCLA) was used to clean up this site.                                       Beginnings:         The Rocky Mountain Region (R2) Abandoned Mine Land (AML) program began          with an inventory of abandoned mines in the region. The initial inventory          was started in 1991 on the Clear Creek Ranger District of the Arapaho-Roosevelt          NF. All R2 inventories were completed in 1998 at a cost of over $1.7 million.          The detailed inventories included an assessment of the “features”          at the AML sites that posed environmental hazards (i.e. acid mine drainage,          high metal levels in dumps, etc.) and/or physical hazardous (i.e. open          shafts, steep pit walls, etc.).                                                                                                          A mine tunnel waste pile that is distributing sediment and heavy                  metals into and nearby stream.                                                    The hill slope after the wooden structure and the waste rock pile                  have been removed.                                        The Little Bear Site  is in the Arapaho                National Forest. The mine tunnel waste pile in the picture above                was one of the causes of both physical and environmental hazards                associated with this abandoned mine. The environmental hazard created                by the mine involved a drainage adit discharging water running through                the sulphide bearing waste rock into a nearby stream. An old timber                load out structure and timberg retaining walls created physical                hazards at the site. To complete reclamation, the waste pile was                removed (above left) and relocated to a suitable landfill, decreasing                the sediment and heavy metals in the drainage water, and the physical                hazards were removed.                                       Assessment:         Each feature was rated based on the severity of the hazard it posed.          Of the 19,960 features that were given an Environmental Degradation Rating          (EDR), 1,221 were rated as either Potentially Significant (EDR=3), Significant          (EDR=2), or Extreme (EDR=1). Of the 19,859 features that were given a          Physical Hazard Rating (PHR); 4,487 were rated as Potentially Dangerous          (PHR=3), Dangerous (PHR=2), or Emergency (PHR=1). These “prioritized”          sites became the focus of the Region’s clean-up efforts.                                                             Assessment                              Number of features assessed                              Prioritized sites (1-3)                                   Environmental Degradation Rating             19,960             1,221                                  Physical Hazard Rating             19,859             4,487                                               AML Sites:         The majority of the sites occur along the Colorado Mineral Belt (Boulder,          Colorado through the San Juan Mountains near Durango, Colorado). The Forests          with the most ""sites"" include the San Juan, Rio Grande, the          Pike/San Isabel, and the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison. Many of          the ""sites"" are mixed-ownership and require coordination with          the State and/or the EPA.                    Progress:         To date, clean up of the “prioritized” sites in R2 has progressed          under the Forest Service’s CERCLA (Comprehensive Environmental Response,          Compensation, and Liability Act) authority. Following the National Contingency          Plan (NCP) the Region has worked with federal and state agencies, community          interest groups, partners, and Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs)          to address the problems found at the “prioritized” sites.          Considerable progress has been made resulting in improved soil and water          conditions throughout the Region. In the case of Clear Creek west of Denver          and the upper Arkansas River near Leadville, significant increases in          fish populations have occurred as a result of on-going abandoned mine          cleanup activities.                                                         Black Hills National Forest:                   The three photos below show the progression of                  recontouring the Trail Fraction mine.

GX045-83-15732838	In Reply Refer To:          3720 (930) P          7240         June 8, 2001                  Information Bulletin No. WY-2001-45         To: Field Managers         From: Deputy State Director, Resources Policy and Management         Subject: Selection of Abandoned Mine Land Projects for 2002          DD 6/20/2001         Wyoming Bureau of Land Management (BLM) continues to participate with          the Wyoming State Abandoned Mine Lands Division (State AML) in a cooperative          AML site characterization project. We anticipate that approximately 250          BLM sites will be characterized by the end of the year and the data entered          into an ACCESS data base. We plan to search this data base later this          fiscal year to develop a draft list of BLM sites having priority safety          and environmental hazards. This list will be distributed to the appropriate          Field Offices for their review and input to determine a final BLM AML          project priority list. This list will then be coordinated with the State          AML so that a schedule of cooperative AML projects can be established          and submitted to the Washington Office for allocation of 1010 AML funding          in FY 2003 and beyond.         In response to a time critical data call from the Washington Office,          the State's contractor searched their interim AML inventory data base          for suitable AML reclamation projects on BLM land. These projects (see          Attachment 1) appear to have water resource or watershed problems that          would qualify for BLM funding in FY 2002.         The State AML Administrator has already indicated that the State is committed          to reclamation of safety hazards at these sites so BLM has an opportunity          to solicit 1010 Soil, Water, Air program funding in FY 2002 to also address          environmental hazards, i.e., impairments of water quality or watershed          function by mine waste/spoil piles in stream channels/floodplains, eroding          waste piles causing sedimentation, etc. In the absence of 1010 funding,          Field Offices would be collaborating with the State AML to reclaim only          the safety hazards at these sites. If these projects receive BLM funding,          participating Field Offices will receive 1010 AML funding for project          coordination activities.                 Please review the attached project list and any related site records          you may have to determine whether you concur with the need to seek BLM          funding to address water resource or watershed problems the contractor          has indicated in this list or additional hazards you have identified.          Please submit your response, including details of resource problems, to          WY-930 by June 20, 2001.         Please contact Rick Schuler at 775-6092 if you have any questions.                               /s/ Donald A. Simpson                                       1 Attachment:          1 - Potential 2002 AML Projects on BLM Land (2 pp.)                                   ATTACHMENT 1          POTENTIAL 2002 AML PROJECTS ON BLM LAND                   RAWLINS FIELD OFFICE: The Old Spencer Mine site (CARB0135, WY-050), about          4 miles south of Muddy Gap in hydrologic catalog unit 10180006, is a combination          underground and surface coal mine believed to have operated in the 1950s.          There is one portal, but the entrance has caved in. Mining occurred along          the strike of the beds in this area as the coal seam is nearly vertical,          at least at the location of the portal. There is one small pit with multiple          seams. It appears that the pit was worked on two levels. The highwall          is approximately 140 feet long and ranges from 15 to 30 feet in height.          Areas of the highwall have failed. The highwall presents a substantial          hazard to the public as well as livestock. The mine is located on both          sides of a stream channel. The remains of a loadout sits on the banks          of the creek. Spoil material is piled on both sides of the creek. The          spoil from the underground mine also contains some coal slack. About 3500          cubic yards of slack and spoil material is impacting half an acre and          some of the material is eroding into and piled directly in a stream drainage.          The chemistry of the mine waste also has the potential to impact water          quality and site productivity. Reclamation costs are estimated at about          $60,000.         RAWLINS FIELD OFFICE: The Ream, Ramsey, and Seehorn coal mines north          of Saratoga are in T19, R85, Section 26. The surface at these series of          mines is split between private and BLM. There is uncertainty regarding          the mineral(s) estate but there is a fair amount of slack piled in drainages          in addition to the hazards of open portals. Reclamation costs on BLM land          are estimated at $150,000.         RAWLINS FIELD OFFICE: Based on nominations from the Field Office, the          State AML is committed to closing the shafts and adits near the Encampment          River Campground. The Field Office AML Coordinator should be prepared          to facilitate BLM's involvement in this project with the assigned State          AML Project Manager.         KEMMERER FIELD OFFICE: An un-named surface coal mine in Lincoln County          lies in T19N R116, Section 4. No hazards were noted but a few environmental          problems are present. Coal slack was piled in the drainage and a dam was          formed. The dam has failed and the material has now partially washed down          stream into a reservoir. The estimated cost to rectify the problems is          $75,000.         WORLAND FIELD OFFICE: The old Sulfur Mine in Hot Springs County, outside          Thermopolis on the road to Meeteetse, lies in T42, R95, Section 28. The          status regarding mineral claims is unknown. This is a large site with          spoil material washing into the drainage. The estimated cost to rectify          the problems is $100,000.         CODY FIELD OFFICE: An un-named coal mine in Park County lies in T56,          R99,          Section 1. This site includes a slightly open portal and slack partially          piled in and washing into the drainage. The estimate to rectify the problems          at this site is $30,000. Also in Park County, there are a number of additional          small sites where the hazards have been mitigated, but coal slack is still          piled in or washing into the drainages. Reclamation of these sites would          cost $5,000 to $10,000.         ROCK SPRINGS FIELD OFFICE: The Kent Mine, south of Rock Springs (SWTR0010,          WY040) in hydrologic catalog unit 14040105, involves mostly environmental          hazards although one portal is still slightly open. About 5000 cubic yards          of slack and spoil material is impacting half an acre and some of the          material is eroding into and piled directly in a stream drainage. The          chemistry of the mine waste also has the potential to impact water quality          and site productivity. Due to the pile locations, the material would need          to hauled off the slope. Reclamation costs are estimated at about $30,000.         LANDER FIELD OFFICE: Based on nominations from the Field Office, the          State AML is committed to additional shaft and adit closures that will          address safety hazards near high use areas in the South Pass district          (based on the 1999 BLM site inventory report) and Copper Mountains (based          on the State Inventory Project). The Field Office AML Coordinator should          be prepared to facilitate BLM's involvement in these projects with the          assigned State AML Project Manager.

A water testing kit is used to record pH, conductivity, and flow.  The mine water is very acidic, and can kill aquatic life in downstream reaches.   In southeastern Ohio, underground coal mining has been mostly replaced by surface or strip mining today.  However, hidden among the hills and hollows of the Wayne National Forest are remnants of the underground coal mine era.     Covered now by brush and trees, are old features associated with abandoned underground mines.  Collapsed entries to an underground chamber, gob or spoil piles, or an orange-tinted seep of water are sometimes all that remain to remind us of mining activities which occurred between the 1800's and mid-1900's.  Unfortunately, some of these old mine features can pose hazards to human safety and to environmental health.   For example, there could be open mine entries which haven't been closed yet.  A curious hiker or hunter could enter an old mine entrance and could get hurt.  Also, the water seeping from some of the old mines is acidic, and kills fish and other aquatic life.     Although not common, subsidence holes which open up to underground mine chambers pose safety hazards to the public.  These features form when there is not a thick roof over the underground mine chamber, and water seeps and erodes its way through. Once found, the Forest Service works with the Ohio Division of Mines and Reclamation to close subsidence holes.  The Forest Service and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers-Huntington District are teaming up to search portions of the Wayne National Forest for these old underground mine features.  The goal of the project is to locate as many mine entrances, acid mine seeps, gob piles,   subsidences  or slumps, and other mine features as possible.  The Corps of Engineers brings much expertise to the project since they completed such an inventory for the Monongahela National Forest in 1998.   Once mapped, the Forest Service will work with partners, like the Ohio Division of Mines and Reclamation, to identify and propose reclamation projects which can improve watershed health and protect human health and safety.  An analysis of the data collected by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers will likely produce a list of mine entries that need to be closed, a list of acid mine seeps affecting water quality in the Wayne National Forest streams, and other such valuable information.   The Abandoned and Inactive Mine Inventory     Many abandoned mine features are not easily seen in the thick brush.  This mine opening was detected because of a slight change in the landscape. U. S. Army Corps of Engineers personnel working on the inventory project include two employees from the Corps' District Office in Huntington, West Virginia.  Steve Spagna, a geologist, and Paul Dean, a surveyor, completed a similar abandoned mine survey for the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia.  Their inventory work will focus on areas of the Ironton Ranger District where the majority of underground mining occurred in the past.  The inventory area is large, and is generally located west of Ohio State Route 93 in the Pine Creek and Storms Creek watersheds.     Steve Spagna shows Barb Flowers (a reclamation inspector with the Ohio Division of Mines and Reclamation) how to use the GPS unit to record the location of the mine features.  The information stored in the GPS unit can be downloaded into a computer, and maps of all the mine features can then be generated. ""Conducting the inventory is a lot of work, but can be considered a rewarding job"", said Paul Dean and Steve Spagna.  ""The topography is sometimes rugged and there is a lot of walking to be done, but we get to see a lot of the Wayne National Forest and some wonderful natural resources"".  As a team, they will walk along streams and up hollows looking for abandoned mine features.  Each is familiar with landscapes affected by past mining, so they are quick to eye a slight change in the landscape which would lead them to a mine entry or gob pile.   When a mine feature is found, a location is recorded.  A Global Positioning Unit, or GPS Unit, is used to record the exact location of the feature.  A receiver is set up, and signals from several satellites are used to obtain the location reading.  Information about the mine feature is then recorded.  For example, they record the dimensions of portal openings, gob piles, and subsidences.  The pH, conductivity and flow of any water seeps is also recorded.   The Inventory Results     Once a mine feature is located, descriptive information is recorded.  The size of mine openings, the presence of hazardous materials, the location in relation to houses, and other information is recorded before the team moves on to the next feature. The location of each mine feature, along with the descriptive information about each feature, will be placed in the Wayne National Forest's Geographical Information System (GIS).  Using the GIS, the Forest Service will be able to analyze the data collected by the Corps of Engineers.  Here are couple analyses which are planned for the data.   Open mine entries ~ the Forest Service will be able to query the database and map all open mine entries.  Biologists can take a look at the information and look for mines with openings suitable for bats, while other employees can prioritize mine openings for closure based on their relationship to buildings, trails, or recreation areas.   Acid mine seeps ~ Forest Service and Ohio Division of Mines and Reclamation hydrologists can map all mine seeps, calculate chemical loadings, and make a determination of the impacts each seep has to the overall water quality of the watershed.  Treatment options can then be prioritized.    For more information  contact  the Fisheries  Biologist at the Ironton Ranger District of the Watershed program manager in the  Nelsonville office."

S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Emergency Response        Office, San Francisco, CA, has completed another milestone in continuing        efforts to cleanup the abandoned Veta Grande mine site.  The Veta Grande        mine/mill site is located on 90 acres of public land, approximately 10        miles southeast of the town of Gardnerville, Nevada, and 0.23 miles east        of U.S. Highway 395.         Mining        activity was sporadic from 1860 until the 1980s, when the Veta Grande        Mining Company renewed operations, then abandoned the site.  In August        2002, a dangerous mine opening was backfilled.  The mine had filled with        water and was a cool, inviting place for people to explore, swim, and        possibly drown.  Water flowing off the site had created a small but rich        riparian zone that attracted wildlife, birds and amphibians.  Some of the        riparian habitat was lost in the backfill effort but the pond has been        reconstructed, the majority of the habitat saved and the recovery is        underway.           In October of 2002, the        cyanide-contaminated soils were completely removed from the site and        properly disposed at a local landfill.           In        cooperation with the BLM, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and their local        area contractor, Camp Dresser & McKee Inc., (CDM) has begun a local study        of the Veta Grande hydrology to better define the migration routes for        cyanide and/or other pollutants through rock fractures.  It is hoped that        the hydrologic study will answer several questions about the nature of the        cyanide plume.

(e) If two or more horses are coupled in the betting as an entry, and one or more of them shall be disqualified for violation of the rules of racing, the balance of the entry shall also be disqualified if in the judgment of the stewards such violation prevented any other horse or horses from finishing ahead of the other part of the entry. If said violation is without such effect upon the finish of the race, penalty therefor may be applied against the offender and the balance of the entry may go unpunished.          (f) Complaints under this section can only be received from the owner, trainer or jockey of the horse alleged to be aggrieved and must be made to the clerk of the scales or to the stewards before or immediately after his jockey has passed the scales.

(a) An objection on any of the following grounds may be received up to 48 hours, exclusive of Sunday, after the last race of the last day of the meeting:              (1) of misstatement, omission or error in the entry under which a horse has run; or              (2) that the horse which ran was not the horse nor of the age which he was represented to be at the time of entry; or              (3) that he was not qualified under the conditions of the race or by reason of default; or              (4) that he has run in contravention of the sections relating to partnership or registration.          (b) In any other case, an objection must be made within 48 hours of the race being run, exclusive of Sunday, save in the case of any fraud or willful misstatement, when there shall be no limit to the time of objection provided the stewards are satisfied that there has been no unnecessary delay on the part of the objector.       Back to Top    4039.20.  Stewards determine extent of disqualification.          The stewards are vested with the power to determine the extent of disqualification in case of fouls. They may place the offending horse behind such horses as, in their judgment, it interfered with, or they may place it last, and they may disqualify it from participation in any part of the purse.       Back to Top 4039.21.  Recovery of money distributed.          If, by reason of an objection to a horse, a race or place is awarded to another horse, the money for such race shall be distributed in accordance with the final placing, and the owner of a horse to which the race or place is finally awarded can recover the money from those who wrongfully received it.       Back to Top   4039.22.  Money held pending determination.          Pending the determination of an objection, any prize which the horse objected to may have won or may win in the race, or any money held by the association holding the meeting, as the price of a horse claimed (if affected by the determination of the objection), shall be withheld until the objection is determined.

GX050-14-16432951	Utah Abandoned Mine Land Program    Cottonwood Wash Watershed Abandoned Mine Reclamation Project                              Looking north at Adit 1 of site number UT-0410-00016 located on USDA-FS administered lands     Looking northwest at Adit 3 of site number UT-0410-00013 located on USDA-FS administered lands                         Looking southeast at Adit 2 of site UT-0678-00003.  This site is located southwest of the mill site.     Looking southeast at Adit 1 of site UT-0678-00020 located on  BLM administered lands.                  List of sites :  BLM AMLIS identification numbers are: UT-0678-0003 through UT-06780007, UT-0678-00009 through UT-0678-00061 and UT-0678-00128 through UT-0678-00131.  There are 20 additional sites on Forest Service lands which were inventoried by BLM.  Since they are not located on BLM administered lands they are not found in BLM AMLIS, but are included in the State of Utah, inventory database.    Discussion of Watershed(s) :  The Cottonwood Wash watershed  (USGS HUC number 14080201) is located in the Lower San Juan-Four Corners.  Cottonwood Wash flows into the San Juan River.  The watershed includes all lands which drain into Cottonwood Wash to the north of State Highway 95.  It is located west of US Hwy 191; north of State Highway 95, along and to the east of Elk Ridge, and south and southwest of the Abajo Mountains. Access to the watershed is normally gained via State Highway 95 and Cottonwood Wash road (north).    The watershed comprises  approximately 143,000 acres and ranges in elevation from about 4,500 feet mean sea level (msl) in the southern-most reaches to above 9,500 feet msl in the upper portions of Elk Ridge.  Most of the area within the watershed consists of federal lands.  BLM-managed lands account for approximately 33 percent of the watershed, about 48,100 acres, while the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USDA-FS) has management jurisdiction over about 85,400 acres or approximately 60 percent of the watershed.  However, 75 percent of the mine sites proposed for reclamation are located on BLM administered lands.  The remaining lands are held in almost equal proportions by the state of Utah and private owners.  About 4,900 acres, representing almost 4 percent of the watershed, is state-owned property.  The Ute Mountain Ute tribe holds most of the remaining 3 percent of the watershed, about 4,400 acres of private property held in allotment.    There are two mining districts in the watershed, the Cottonwood Wash mining district and the Elk Ridge mining district. The Cottonwood Wash mining district is centered at the junction of Cottonwood and Brushy Basin Washes, approximately 7 miles southwest of the town of Blanding.  This mining district mined vanadium and uranium ores.  The vanadium mills operated in this mining district from 1937 to about 1943.  The Elk Ridge mining district is located in the upper portions of the Cottonwood Wash watershed.  Only uranium ores were mined from this mining district.        Why Was Project Area Selected :  The mining-related disturbances in Cottonwood Wash exist on lands managed by different agencies at the state and federal levels.  This project area was selected because water quality sampling identified radiologic constituents in the water (gross alpha particles) at levels that exceeded the State's water quality standards.  As a result Cottonwood Wash has been listed on the State's 2000 303 (d) list of non-supporting waters and the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) process has been initiated.    In addition, this watershed provides an opportunity for Utah BLM; United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service; State of Utah, Division of Oil, Gas and Mining, Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program; and State of Utah, Division of Water Quality to work together to clean-up an entire watershed.       What Are the AML Problems / Project Objectives :    The objectives of this reclamation effort are to:              Close mine openings that present a risk to human health and welfare.  Open mines are dangerous: roofs may cave in and walls may collapse; internal timber supports may fail; drops to lower levels of the mine may be obstructed or unseen; oxygen may be at dangerously low levels; and radiation exposure is a concern at these sites.                        Stabilize mine waste dumps that are eroding into the watershed and contributing to  degradation of water quality.  Poor water quality limits beneficial uses for drinking, recreation, aquatic life, wildlife, grazing, and agriculture        Reclaim unneeded access roads, mineral exploration roads and trails since they are sources of sediment runoff, pose a threat to water quality, and may remove lands from beneficial resource production.  Drill holes located on or near these road ways need to be plugged because they pose a threat to physical safety and are a pathway for pollutants to enter ground water.       Stabilize the primary road in Cottonwood Wash which provides access to most of the mine sites and  exploration areas.  This road, including associated stream crossings, requires stabilization to reduce sediment runoff to streams, minimize dust, and limit further degradation of water and air quality.           What Is the Planned Approach :  An environmental assessment has been written to analyze the impacts of the reclamation project proposed for the watershed.  The Proposed Action is to stabilize and/or reclaim mining-related disturbances within the Cottonwood Wash watershed in order to accomplish the objectives stated in the discussion on why the project was selected. The Proposed Action would involve reclamation of 81 abandoned mine sites resulting in approximately 144 acres of surface disturbance, reclamation of about 14.4 miles of mine access roads, reclamation of about 44 miles of mining exploration roads, and stabilization of approximately 14 miles of the Cottonwood Wash road. Stabilization of the road would involve graveling and construction of 17 hardened stream crossings.    A copy of the EA may be obtained from Dale Davidson at the Monticello Field Office after January 15, 2001.  His telephone number is (435) 587-1513 and his e-mail address is Dale_Davidson@blm.gov.    How Will Success Be Measured :  A monitoring plan would be developed describing the approach each reclamation activity, applicable environmental/regulatory standards, area and activities to be monitored, method of monitoring, and frequency of monitoring. Out of the approximately 143,000 acres within the watershed, approximately 144 acres would be directly disturbed by this proposal.    Water monitoring would continue after the reclamation is completed to determine if the objective of improving water quality has been met.  In addition, five years after reclamation activities are completed vegetation success will be determined. Vegetation would be judged successful if the reclaimed areas contain 90% of the vegetative cover of the surrounding area,  if no more than 10% of this vegetation is weeds, and if there are no noxious weeds.   A monitoring plan for historic and prehistoric resources is part of the Programmatic Agreement being developed for this project.    What Are the Estimated Costs : The total cost of the project will be between 1.5-2 million dollars.    The BLM contribution will be approximately $500,000.  The USDA-FS contribution will be approximately $750,000.  The State of Utah Abandoned Mine Reclamation Programs contribution is approximately $311,000.      Last Updated: 12/15/0 0

GX066-95-11609028	"Agriculture Links                     Consumers                     Farmers and Producers                     Food Industry                    Buyers                     Institutional                    Food Providers                     Teachers,                    Students, FFA                     Everything Jersey Fresh                     Agriculture Home                                                                                                   Proposed        Economic Development Strategy        Equine                                              BACKGROUND           During the past 25 years, the region's horse racing industry has faced          many challenges including the advent of casino gambling, an increasingly          popular state lottery, the 2001 closure of Garden State Park, and declining          audiences at live races due to simulcasting. To compensate, states neighboring          New Jersey are combining different wagering technologies with horse racing.          Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York already have either slot machines          or video lottery terminals or they have recently passed legislation allowing          them at racetracks. These efforts are attracting larger racetrack audiences          and enhancing revenues.          Still, New Jersey's equine industry, composed predominately of pleasure          breeds, accounts for an estimated 81,000 acres of farmland across the          state. The state's breeding stock alone has an overall value of $168 million.          Equine related assets including feed, bedding, fencing, equipment, transportation,          insurance, blacksmith and veterinary services contribute $672 million          to the state's economy annually.          As part of its efforts to support the equine industry, the New Jersey          Department of Agriculture administers numerous disease control programs          to help keep livestock healthy. The Department is a leader in the research          on the West Nile Virus and its work has been used throughout the world          to develop programs that address the disease.                   In keeping with the goals outlined in its strategic plan, the Department          continues to identify strategies to ensure the economic viability of the          state's equine industry as well as the agricultural industry as a whole.           STRATEGIES                               Strengthen Breeder Reward Programs                                          Amend legislation to allow ""Thoroughbred Jersey Bred Breeder Awards""                to be paid to owners and breeders racing in neighboring states.                This would provide horsemen an opportunity to be paid for animals                competing on a 12-month basis. Horses would be able to race in states                contiguous to New Jersey 30 days after live racing ends here, and                up to 30 days before live racing resumes.                               Encourage participation in a new breeder program established                by the Standardbred Breeders and Owners Association of New Jersey                as an incentive program to have mares reside in the state for nine                months while in foal.                                                                    Implement New Breeding Programs                                          Establish a new thoroughbred breeding program, mirroring the Maryland                Million, which would provide a full day of racing with purses totaling                $1 million, giving breeders significant races to anticipate. Stallions                standing in New Jersey would be nominated yearly, which would ensure                their offspring would be eligible for nomination to the program.                The offspring of an eligible stallion would be nominated as a weanling.                                              Establish a new standardbred-breeding program for foals born                in New Jersey.                                                                   Expand Research                                          Work with Rutgers University's Cook College to continue development                of a state-of-the-art research facility for its Equine Science Center.                The Center is developing cost -effective techniques for nutrient                and waste management to ensure the compatible co-existence of horse                farms in urban and suburban environments.                                                                    Restructure Revenues                                          Revisit the existing statute that sets funding levels for various                segments of the equine industry to ensure promotional and educational                programs are adequately supported.                 n Encourage Development of New Training Facility                               Facilitate and encourage development of a training facility for                thoroughbreds. The closing of Garden State Park resulted in the                loss of the only thoroughbred training facility in the state, forcing                trainers to leave New Jersey at the end of racing season because                they have no place to train or lodge for the winter.

Support reform of policies and procedures addressing temporary                agricultural worker visas at the federal and state level.                              Encourage farmers to take a pro-active approach to learning about                their responsibilities at both the federal and state levels to ensure                worker safety."
GX023-74-4355551	"OFFICE OF SURFACE MINING          OVERSIGHT & INSPECTION BRANCH       NEWSLETTER    October 2000      4480 REFUGEE ROAD         THREE PARKWAY CTR      COLUMBUS, OH 43232         PITTSBURGH, PA 15220               614-866-0578         412-937-2153        Interior and energy secretaries sign     MOU To Promote Abandoned Mine  Land Reclamation Through Reforestation     Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), to promote the reclamation of abandoned coal mine sites through reforestation.  The Energy Department's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy and the Interior Department's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) will administer the MOU.    OSM Acting Director Kathrine L. Henry said that this approach to reclaim abandoned mine lands (AML) offers a number of environmental and economic benefits, including higher quality reclamation, an increase in the number of sites reclaimed, economic opportunities, including employment for local communities, aesthetic and recreational improvements, sale of forest products, and the opportunity for reporting carbon reductions through sequestration in forests.      ""Reforestation provides an opportunity for mine operators, utilities, and environmental organizations to work together to help promote ecologically diverse and balanced forest ecosystems on abandoned mine sites,"" Henry said.    Part of OSM's mission, under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, is to mitigate the effects of past mining by aggressively pursuing reclamation of abandoned coal mines.  OSM has identified and prioritized about 627,000 acres of     abandoned mine land for reclamation.   This mine land, in its unreclaimed condition, substantially degrades the quality of the environment, prevents or damages the beneficial use of land or water resources, or endangers the health and safety of the public.     DOE's mission includes solving national energy and environmental problems in order to provide for a cleaner, more energy-secure nation.  DOE has responsibility for the Climate Challenge Program, including voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas reductions, which include reforestation projects under the Energy Policy Act of 1992.     OSM has an ongoing reforestation initiative which promotes reforesting both active and abandoned mine lands.  The MOU focuses on reforestation of abandoned mine lands.   OSM will work with the utility industry, other private entities, and state and tribal AML programs to inform them about the MOU and DOE's Climate Challenge Program, to help identify potential reforestation sites and to facilitate funding partnerships between private donors and state and tribal governments.  DOE will work with interested parties for voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas reductions from reforestation projects, under the Energy Policy Act.    Recognizing that OSM's and DOE's  responsibilities are complementary, OSM and DOE believe that collaboration, as defined by the agreement, will enable both organizations to more effectively accomplish their respective missions.    You may obtain copies of the MOU from the OSM homepage @ http//www.osmre.gov.   Or, you can call our office at 614-866-0578 and we will send you a copy.                    Ohio's SOAP Grant    On September 28, 2000,  George J. Rieger, Program Manager of the Oversight and Inspection Office,  awarded Ohio its FY 2000 Small Operators Assistance Program Grant of  $97,717.  This grant provides 100 percent Federal funding that Ohio will use to reimburse qualified small operators for hydrologic and geologic information necessary to obtain their surface mining permits.     This award is the third major action of the Federal Fiscal Year for Ohio, and completes the full transfer of all federally allocated funds.  The prior actions were the awards of Ohio's FY 2000 AML grant  for $8,248,776.00 and Ohio's Regulatory Grant for $1,438,580.00.          Tour for Cub Scouts    On Saturday, October 7, 2000,  24 Cub Scouts from Dens in Grantsville and Cumberland, Maryland, along with their leaders, toured the United Energy Coal Co. mining operation, permit number 40, located near Frostburg, Maryland.  Company representatives Gerald Ramsberg and  Chuck Houdershelt explained surface mining operations at the site and how the land is reclaimed following the removal of coal.  The Scouts were shown various aspects of the mining operation including the removal  of overburden, saving topsoil, augering operations, blasting, and safety procedures.           Maryland Revegetation Evaluation Techniques Study Completed    The OSM Oversight and Inspection Office (OIO) has released the final report for the EY00 Maryland Revegetation Evaluation Techniques study. The objective of the study was to evaluate the methodologies the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) used to determine the success of phase II and phase III revegetation for compliance with Maryland's approved mining and reclamation program.      MDE is currently using a visual estimating technique to evaluate the success of phase II and phase III vegetation in Maryland.  The study determined that this technique has been successful in determining whether to release bond on sites with either heavy or sparse ground cover (1) .  However, visual estimating techniques are neither statistically valid,  repeatable, nor highly accurate.  Both federal regulations under 30CFR 816.116(a)(2) and the Maryland equivalent under the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 26.20.29.07 require that standards of success be judged by using sampling techniques with a 90 percent statistical confidence interval.  Because a  visual estimating technique cannot be used to meet this requirement, the report recommended that Maryland adopt statistically valid measurement techniques such as those referred to and/or demonstrated in the study.    For copies of the report, contact Jeff Smith (412) 937-2827, or access the OIO web site at  http://www.coh.osmre.gov/ .          Secretary Babbitt Announces      Winners of Excellence in Surface      Mining Reclamation Awards      Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt has announced that coal mine operators in Alabama, Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia are winners of this year's Excellence in Surface Mining Reclamation Awards.      ""The winners of this year's competition have done a remarkable job in setting high standards for restoring mined lands for productive use,"" said Babbitt.  ""We take pride in their commitment to reclaiming the land and protecting the environment.""    The awards are sponsored each year by Interior's Office of Surface Mining (OSM), the agency responsible for regulating the environmental impacts of coal production. Nominations from coal mine operators were first screened by state coal mining regulatory agencies and OSM Field Offices, which forwarded state-level winners to OSM Headquarters for final judging.  The final judging was completed by a panel of experts from OSM and other Interior Department bureaus.     Acting OSM Director Kathrine L. Henry presented the year 2000 awards at the National Mining Association's annual meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 10, 2000.  ""These projects are examples of the coal industry working with regulators to implement a law that benefits everyone in the nation.  They set the standards for the future, and help preserve and enhance the quality of life in the nation's coalfields,"" Henry said.    Director's Award:    Peabody Coal Company, Western Kentucky Mine Operations , won the prestigious OSM Director's Award for 2000.  The focus of the Director's Award changes each year; for 2000, it was for exemplary reforestation on reclaimed coal mine land.   Peabody's tree planting efforts at coal mine sites in Western Kentucky began voluntarily in 1948, long before reclamation was required, and continue today.  Its pioneering planting techniques on surface mined-lands are now used throughout the country.    Company foresters and soil scientists recognized the long-term environmental and economic benefits of forest lands.  Reforestation goals were established that resulted in large continuous tracks of forest and wildlife areas.  Today, these reclaimed lands provide multiple benefits, including recreation, soil conservation, timber production, and wildlife conservation.      National Awards:    Seneca Coal Company, Seneca II Mine,  Hayden, Colorado, for its outstanding reclamation efforts in an arid environment, which reclaimed over 1,800 acres at the site during the mine's 30-year life. The company has concentrated on reestablishing native vegetation, including grasses, forbs, and shrubs.  About 200 cattle have grazed on the reclaimed rangeland each summer.  The wildlife habitat is also enhanced.  Deer and elk  graze on the native grassland.  Marmots and other rodents live in constructed rock-piles, and sharp-tailed grouse mating grounds have been established.    Stone Mining Company, Grants Branch Lake,   McVeigh, Kentucky, for reclaiming a large coal slurry impoundment into a county park which includes a 21-acre lake with 6,200 feet of shoreline.  Stocked with more than 10,000 fish, it is a serene, peaceful setting complete with paved roads, parking, and picnic areas. When final bond is released, the land will be transferred to the county as a permanent public recreation area.    TXU, Big Brown, Monticello, Thermo, Martin Lake, and Oak Hill Mines,  in Eastern Texas, for its extensive, on going reforestation efforts on about 72 percent of reclaimed mine land at the sites.  Since the early 1970's, over 15 million trees have been planted.  About half of the area is developed as wildlife habitat with 34 species of trees. Seedling survival rates are high and the established stands are sustaining growth as good as, or better than pre-mine forests.   The project also enhances watershed protection, air quality, recreation, and aesthetics.    Amerikohl Mining, INC., Leon Mine,   Laurelville, Pennsylvania, for mining and reclaiming a partially mined site that was discharging acidic water containing large amounts of metals.  Today, the site has been reclaimed into a pasture and forest area which the owner can develop into home sites after the bonds are released.  Amerikohl took a bad situation and turned it into exemplary reclamation.    Black Beauty Coal Company and Vigo Coal Company, Columbia Mine,   Oakland City, Indiana, for reclamation that created some of the best reforestation and wildlife habitat to be found on reclaimed coal mine lands.  The companies consistently replaced soil to depths of 4-5 feet at the site, although only 12 inches were required.    Mining and reclamation occurred within 100 feet of an adjacent wetland, without any adverse impact.      Rosebud Mining Company, McCollough Mine,   Karns City, Pennsylvania, for remining and reclaiming the 44-acre mine site containing abandoned spoil banks, dangerous highwalls, water-filled pits, an abandoned underground mine, and a large illegal domestic dump.  Today, it is difficult to see any traces of these hazards or the recent coal mining.  It is impossible to identify the line between unmined land and reclaimed mine land.  The entire 44 acres appear as productive as the adjacent unmined area.    Drummond Company, Inc., Arkadelphia 5761 Mine,   Arkadelphia, Alabama, for exemplary reclamation at this mine site which now produces hay, seed, and timber crops.  Forestry is an extremely important industry in the economy of this part of Alabama, and Drummond has now planted over 600 acres of developing young forest.  Professional foresters have estimated the growth potential of these pines is greater than that of the unmined surrounding area.    Peabody Coal Company, Ken Surface Mine,  Ohio County, Kentucky, for reclaiming a site which had been mined for over 50 years, to award winning standards.  Substantial amounts of native and Western grasses were used, over 200,000 trees and shrubs were planted, and 12 permanent impoundments were reclaimed.  Water quality problems associated with years of mining have been cleaned up, and the area is used for hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation.     Big Sky Coal Company, Big Sky Mine,  Rosebud County, Montana, for exemplary reclamation which has returned the former mine site to a livestock grazing area.  Vegetation monitoring shows the levels of cover and production to be equal to or better than native vegetation adjacent to the site.  During the spring, approximately 200 cow-calf pairs use the reclaimed grazing land.     Virginia Energy Company, Twin Star Mine #2,  Hurley, Virginia, for reclaiming over 8,000 feet of hazardous abandoned mine highwalls and outslopes into productive hay and pasture land.  As the amount of coal to be mined in Virginia decreases, mining operations like Virginia Energy have demonstrated that previously mined lands can be remined, the environment improved, and productive land created.    The OSM Excellence in Surface Mining Reclamation awards program began in 1986 to publicly recognize outstanding active coal mine reclamation and publicize exemplary reclamation techniques.  A brochure announcing the year 2001 program, with complete details about how to nominate a project is available from State regulatory agencies, OSM Headquarters, Regional and Field Offices, and from the OSM homepage at www.osmre.gov/awards.htm.          Public Comment on Amendment      Proposed by Interior's Office of    Hearings and Appeals      The Department of the Interior has extended the public comment period on its proposed rules for the Office of Hearings and Appeals concerning an award of costs and expenses, including attorney fees.  The proposed amendment provides that an applicant for a permit may only receive an award from OSM, if OSM denies an application in bad faith and for the purpose of harassing or embarrassing the applicant.    Anyone wishing to submit comments should send them to:     Robert L. Baum, Director  Office of Hearings and Appeals  4015 Wilson Blvd., Rm. 1111  Arlington, VA 22203    To be considered, the agency must receive your comments by November 13, 2000.          OSM Seeks Input on       Innovative Practices      OSM would like to feature innovative and successful mining and reclamation practices and techniques used by the coal industry in Ohio and Maryland.  We will highlight practices and techniques in our newsletter to exhibit industries' efforts toward enhancing and improving mining and reclamation in Maryland and Ohio.  If requested, an OSM representative will visit a site or operation to learn about the practice or technique submitted.  If the practice or technique is suitable, we will feature it in our newsletter.  For an evaluation and consideration of a practice or technique, contact Mark Balaj at 614-866-0578, ext. 107.          OSM Completes Study on    Reclamation Success in Ohio    OSM has completed its annual oversight review of mined land that has achieved the reclamation standards of the Ohio Program.  We conducted our evaluation on a sample of the reclamation segments approved for bond release by the Ohio Division of Mineral Resources Management (DMRM) and through a review of bond releases provided by DMRM.  Our purpose is to verify that DMRM is approving bond releases only when the permittee has met all standards required by the Ohio Program and to review success in meeting the objectives of contemporaneous reclamation requirements.     The study found that DMRM's evaluation of industry's compliance with the on-the-ground performance standards for bond release is sound.  On-the-ground reclamation meets or exceeds performance standards in nearly all cases.  Mined land is restored to productive use with 91 percent restored to pasture/grazing land, with hay production generally exceeding the county average.     Some improvements are necessary.  Although our oversight inspections did not identify any sites where material damage to the hydrologic balance could be demonstrated, DMRM and OSM need to continue to improve the process used for determining whether mining operations have minimized impacts to the hydrologic balance prior to final approval of bond release.     DMRM should continue its successful efforts to ensure contemporaneous reclamation and timely bond release.

The BLM supports the conveyance of public lands in Montana as described in S.1218, if amended to make the conveyance subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and does not object to the conveyance in Nevada as described in S.408. The Bureau does not support S.610, the land conveyance in Wyoming, and we do not support S.1629, the Oregon Land Exchange Act of 1999 because we believe the exchange objectives discussed in this bill can be accomplished within existing administrative authorities and it is important to complete the public review process as part of our land exchange procedures.    I first wish to discuss S.610, and the conveyance of certain BLM lands to the Westside Irrigation District in Wyoming. This bill would enable the Westside Irrigation District to purchase approximately 39,000 acres of BLM lands northwest of Worland, Wyoming which would then be converted to agricultural production through the use of overhead sprinkler irrigation systems. The surface rights would be purchased at fair market value and the monies derived from the sale of these public lands would be used by the BLM to acquire other private parcels having resource values.    The Bureau has concerns with S.610. First, the BLM opposes land disposals without appropriate planning, NEPA analysis, and public participation. The BLM Grass Creek Resource Management Plan does not identify these lands for disposal. Additionally, no environmental analysis has been completed for the proposal and there has been very little public involvement.    Also, the legal description as identified in the legislation is very vague and requires clarification. After a review of BLM land status records, the total acreage was determined to be approximately 39,000 acres. As I mentioned, the purpose of this legislation is to permit the Westside Irrigation District to add 39,000 acres of arable farming units to their district. Arable is a term used for lands that are suitable for cultivation. However, in 1986 the Bureau of Reclamation completed a classification study and found that there were not 39,000 acres of arable lands, but only 7,500 acres suitable for cultivation in the area. The remaining acres were classified to be non-arable.     In addition to the discrepancy in the arable lands, a partial cultural inventory on approximately 2,000 acres within the proposed sale area, yielded 38 sites that were evaluated as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. An additional 471 cultural sites were found but were not evaluated for eligibility for the National Register. Six of the eligible sites are believed to have been occupied by Paleo-Indians.     The area is also valuable for paleontological research. For example, it includes many localities where scientifically significant vertebrate fossils have been collected and studied. These fossils, and the layers of rock where they occur, document the history of life in North America. In addition, approximately 15,000 acres have been identified as crucial mule deer and antelope winter range and agricultural development of the area could potentially affect fisheries in the Bighorn River.     The area is rich in mineral resources as well. Yet, despite this mineral value the bill states that all rights, title, and interest of the United States be transferred. This would include the mineral estate, including the three oil and gas fields, (including 22 producing wells), gravel deposits used for construction and road building, and a number of rights-of-way are also located within the affected area and easements the BLM holds for access to public lands. Inasmuch as the BLM wishes to support opportunities for rural development in Wyoming, we cannot support the divestiture of these resource rich lands from public ownership.    The BLM supports S.1218, if amended to make the conveyance of 2.06 acres of public land to the Landusky School District in Landusky, Montana, subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). By way of history, the Landusky elementary school was constructed in 1904 and an auxiliary school building was completed in 1992. The subject lots are both adjacent to private lands. The BLM assumed administrative jurisdiction from the U.S. Forest Service in 1966. Also, in 1966, the Landusky townsite withdrawal was established by Public Order No. 3938. While establishing the townsite, BLM officials also created a school reserve and intended to include the Landusky elementary school as part of the school reserve. The old townsite authority would have allowed the patenting of those school lots to an incorporated town, however, since Landusky is not incorporated, those lots were never patented. In 1976, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) repealed the townsite laws, and the lands still remain under the jurisdiction of the BLM. In 1991, the fair market value for these two lots was $30,300. The current value of these lots has not yet been determined, but their monetary value is not likely to be significant. The lands are currently being used for their intended purpose, and because the Landusky school district has little funding capability, we recommend that the lots be conveyed with no monetary consideration subject to NEPA requirements.    The BLM does not object to S.408, the conveyance of a 4.48 acre BLM administrative site in Carson City, Nevada, for use as a senior center. The administrative site was used as a vehicle and ware yard in conjunction with the BLM Carson City Field Office. The BLM site is vacant and the city of Carson City desires to acquire the parcel for an assisted living center in conjunction with existing controlled health care facilities. The existing Senior Center and intensive care facility are currently adjacent to the subject property. In May 1998, the city of Carson City submitted an application under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act (R&PP) for a residential and domicile facility associated with extended care. However, the residential aspect of the assisted living facility did not qualify under the R&PP Act. An additional option considered was disposal of the property by direct sale at fair market value, however, the city indicated they could not afford to purchase the parcel as the subject property is in downtown Carson City where real estate values could easily exceed $300,000.    Finally, I would like to address S. 1629, the Oregon Land Exchange Act of 1999. This land exchange was first identified in the BLM John Day Resource Management Plan (RMP) in 1984. In 1993, several private land owners identified an opportunity for consolidated land ownership. One of the larger property owners in the area began land exchange discussions with a third party facilitation organization known as the Clearwater Land Exchange. The initial proposal involved an exchange where the BLM would dispose of difficult to manage isolated lands, and in exchange would gain valuable stream side areas.     As these proposals evolved, the Clearwater Land Exchange began to contact other area landowners to discuss the array of possible land exchanges with the BLM. Following a public tour in October of 1996, the BLM, in December of 1996, went forward with the notice of intent to develop an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the exchange. After extensive public outreach to landowners, local communities, and tribal governments the BLM began work on the draft environmental impact statement, and in June of 1998, the final EIS was published. However, the public review process has not been completed regarding individual proposed land exchange transactions.    In all, this proposed exchange involves the exchange of over 160,000 acres in multiple Oregon counties. The BLM would potentially transfer 90,000 acres of isolated public lands, and acquire 70,000 acres of private land with significant natural resource values thus creating an improved land ownership and management pattern in Northeast Oregon.     As one can imagine, the sheer scope of the land exchange being discussed has resulted in a process containing a series of smaller and more manageable phases. Once the Record of Decision and public review process is completed, and assuming the NEPA documentation supports the decision to go forward with the exchange, the first phase would primarily involve lands in Grant, Wheeler, Umatilla, and Morrow Counties. Following the completion of the disposal of lands in the first phase, the BLM would continue the public review process for future proposed exchange transactions and with the help of the Clearwater Land Exchange work to exchange the remaining lands.    Conclusion    Mr. Chairman, these bills presented before you today are an indication that the public lands are becoming more and more an avenue by which many can benefit. With the amendments suggested, we are pleased to be able to support the local communities of both Landusky, Montana and Carson City, Nevada in providing land for their needs. We also support the tenets of the northeast Oregon land exchange proposal, however, without the use of legislation. We also look forward to working with the Westside Irrigation District to bring about an administrative solution to their rural needs. We would be happy to work with both the Oregon and Wyoming delegations to provide a solution.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate this opportunity to appear before the Subcommittee and discuss these bills. I will be glad to answer any questions.

GX033-45-8036700	"Capitol Reef     Cultural Landscape Report                 ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION  (continued)    CULTURAL TRADITIONS    Early Mormons in Utah were agrarian, strengthened by a sense of gathering as they sought refuge as a people from religious persecution. From the outset, they preferred agriculture over mining or industry, even though the territory was woefully lacking in arable land. Through centrally planned and executed acts of land management, they established what is known to historians and geographers as the Mormon Cultural Area, distinguished by the diversion of mountain streams for irrigation and by a distinctive village settlement pattern. Most early Mormon towns were laid out in a four-square grid with adjacent agricultural fields. Property rights were subordinate to religious and community objectives, and speculation in land was denounced. In response to the scarcity of good agricultural lands, Mormons established institutions of austerity, in which the land was valued at least as much for its social and political benefits as its economic uses.              North end of Fruita, looking southeast toward Johnson Mesa, 1993.        Land-related values were closely interwoven with religious faith, giving agrarian ideals added significance. Central to the belief in agrarian values was the idea that Mormons would be blessed by providence and that the ""desert should blossom as the rose,"" as prophesied by Brigham Young. Agriculture was to be basic in the early ""Kingdom of God."" It was to be the Saints moving into ""the nooks and corners. . . wherever there is a spring or a bit of land—building up, making the earth bring forth its products."" Every man would ""take up a piece of land  [thus forming]  the nucleus of his prosperity, wealth, and comparative independence."" [ 3 ]     In his article ""Imprint of Agricultural Systems on the Utah Landscape,"" Historian Charles S. Peterson states that Utah produced three distinctive agricultural landscapes: 1) the Mormon village, 2) the homestead landscape, superimposed by 3) the landscape of dry farming (the latter emerged after the turn of the century, and does not apply to the landscape of Fruita). [ 4 ] The Mormon village landscape was based on the City of Zion concept developed by Joseph Smith and others in 1833. The plan called for each community to be laid out in a square grid pattern, with ample land for each family to have a home, orchards, and garden. Wide streets and irrigation ditches separated individual lots. The LDS ward chapel was centrally located in the town square. Fields were distributed in 5-, 10-, or 20-acre plots, and were required to be outside the town boundaries. Villages were thus surrounded by a greenbelt that was both protective and growth limiting. Speculative withholding of land from use was prohibited by common consent, as the survival of the community depended on the maximum use of available land and water resources. The pattern was established and prescribed by Church leadership and strongly influenced the character of early Mormon communities, particularly the string of colonies along the west front of the Wasatch Range that formed what cultural geographers call the ""Mormon Corridor.""    The Homestead Act of 1862 and other Federal land laws eventually imposed a different pattern of settlement on the land by granting much more acreage per person than that distributed by the Church. This pattern is the one most evident in the settlements of the Colorado Plateau region, including that of Fruita. Large land grants were more conducive to livestock raising and commercial farming, but tended to scatter rather than concentrate communities and farmland. Peterson describes the homestead in Utah after 1890 as a landscape of increased ""Americanization,"" or transition from Mormon-dominated cultural values to those more akin to the larger American society. [ 5 ] While the late-nineteenth-century Mormon homestead showed the influence of the early village pattern in its self-sufficient lifestyle and dependence on irrigation, it nonetheless signified a change in direction. The homesteading Mormons in the final decades of the nineteenth century and thereafter looked increasingly to speculation and commercial farming. Land acquisition, distribution, and use became less a factor of community and more a matter of individual initiative.              Residents of Fruita at farewell gathering for Amasa E. Pierce family, about 1915.        Fruita was settled during this transitional period in Utah's history when Mormon domination over patterns of land use was weakening, and distribution and patterns had experienced a transition from a distinctively Mormon village landscape to a turn-of-the-century homestead that was not unlike many others throughout the West. In this regard, Fruita differs from most historians' view of the typical Mormon settlement. It was not founded directly as part of a colonizing mission, as many Mormon towns were prior to the 1880s. Nor did its river valley topography allow for the typical Mormon townsite plan, one that imposed a rigid NSEW grid system on the land and whose nucleus was the LDS meeting house. [ 6 ] Fruita never possessed a formal meeting house nor even had its own LDS ward. A number of its early residents may never have attended the religious meetings held in the Fruita Schoolhouse or in local homes when the visiting Bishop from Torrey came to town. Fruita was primarily composed of what author Wallace Stegner has referred to as ""relaxed"" Mormons. Still, as in most small communities, it was common knowledge who were the faithful and who they were not. [ 7 ]     Thus while Fruita is not, in the strict historical sense, the ""typical"" Mormon town, what is evident in Fruita's past (and in its landscape) are the profound ways in which this small community is typically Mormon. Peterson wrote regarding Fruita:       Habit, family, environment (isolation as well as aridity), economics, and Americanizing influences all tended to make Mormonness a matter of individual, family, and locally based group patterns. These vary from place to place as well as with time but. . . there was a Mormon culture that was recognizable on the landscape during that [historic] era and there still is. [ 8 ]        Fruita once contained a number of significant landscape characteristics identified as ""typically Mormon,"" some of which still exist: a prevailing rural feeling created by orchards, pastures, humble dwellings and ""rough"" agricultural outbuildings, an extensive irrigation system of ditches, and particular types of vegetation (particularly fruit trees, nut trees, mulberries, and poplars; vegetable gardens and ornamental flowering bushes are also characteristic). Another feature of Mormon landscapes is a general ""unkempt"" appearance of farms whose outbuildings, corrals, and fences, were never painted. The typical ""Mormon fence,"" an irregular mixture of various types of poles, posts, slabs and pickets, documented in historic photographs of Fruita, can still be seen in surrounding towns on the Colorado Plateau. [ 9 ] The landscape often looked, and in fact may have been, impoverished.    Fruita followed a social pattern that had signs of cooperation and continued religious ties, as well as increasing individualism and commercialism. Fruita's initial pattern of settlement, in which a number of families actually occupied an individual claim, provides evidence that those who homesteaded in the valley discovered a practical way of modifying the federal system to accommodate both the needs of the individual and those of the community. While the Fruita area was initially claimed in its entirety by four settlers, there were seven families living on the land. Consistent with the Mormon belief that no man should own more land than their family could farm, Fruita's early settlers developed an arrangement that, by mutual consent, divided the 160-acre tracts into more manageable pieces. Shortly after (and sometimes even prior to) obtaining legal title, the land was sold by the claimant to the occupants that were residing there. The sale price rarely exceeded $1.25 per acre, thus it is doubtful that land speculation was a motive. Rather, it appears that allowing additional families to live and work on the land may have benefited everyone, both claimant and squatter alike. With more than one family working a claim, development necessary to ""prove"" the claim (particularly irrigation works) was more easily accomplished. Thus mutual cooperation assured both the claimant (and any others who lived on the claim) that the land would be theirs at the end of 5 years.    In addition to having a tradition of different attitudes toward land distribution and an emphasis on cooperative agricultural practices, the Saints were distinct from non-Mormons in their handling of land disputes. In ""Homesteading in Zion,"" Historian Lawrence B. Lee writes that the       . . . homesteading practices  [of Mormons]  certainly revealed that they were a unique people. Claims contesting was minimal among the Mormons, while it was the order of the day on other homestead frontiers. Mormons in good standing with their church simply did not use the land office machinery for settling land disputes with other Mormons. The priesthood courts of ward and stake mediated between rival claimants, and the disputes were never aired in public. [ 10 ]        Because environmental conditions often played a role in the success or failure of Mormon settlements, the Mormon tradition of cooperative agriculture was particularly important to communities settling beyond the Mormon Corridor. Of the nearly 500 settlements established in the West by the LDS during the latter half of the nineteenth century, an estimated 46 settlements, or nearly 10 percent, failed because of environmental factors. By the time Utah attained statehood in 1896, practically all the acres that could be brought under irrigation had been occupied. The year 1900 has been recognized as a practical terminal date for Mormon colonization. [ 11 ]     While one might expect that the major reason for settlement failure in the semiarid and arid West would be inadequate water supply, more often an excess of water created serious problems. As settlers established homesteads along the Colorado Plateau by using irrigation water from the tributaries of the Colorado River, they encountered and contended with periodic flooding. Nearly all of the settlements founded in these areas struggled at some time with the fluctuation of the rivers and streams. Dams built to control and divert water for irrigation purposes were destroyed repeatedly by sudden floods.    From 1890 through the early twentieth century, flooding of massive proportions devastated the settlements downriver from Fruita and eventually made ghost towns of several, including Aldridge and Blue Valley (Giles). Insufficient irrigation water was also a factor in the failure of two other Mormon communities downriver, Clifton and Elephant. Since the size of most Mormon settlements were small and environmental conditions were precarious, cooperation among families on the Colorado Plateau could (and did) make the difference between success or failure of the community.           <<<  Previous   <<<  Contents  >>>   Next  >>>      http://www.nps.gov/care/clr/clr4b.htm  Last Updated: 01-Apr-2003"

""These award winners have done a great job in setting new standards for the industry,"" said Babbitt. ""I commend their performance in restoring the landscape and improving the environment for future generations to enjoy.""     The annual awards program sponsored by the Interior Department's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), examines nominated projects and honors the best examples of abandoned mine land reclamation. Winners were selected by a panel of judges from OSM, state abandoned mine reclamation agencies, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Abandoned Mine Program.     OSM Director Kathy Karpan will present the winning companies with the 1999 awards during ceremonies at the National Association of Abandoned Mine Land Programs annual meeting in Seven Springs, Pennsylvania, August 24, 1999. Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Award winners representing each of OSM's three regions, and one selected as best in the nation, are:    National Abandoned Mine Land Award    -- The Navajo Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Department's  Monument Valley 2 AML Reclamation Project  on the Navajo reservation, near the Arizona/Utah border which reclaimed a highly toxic radioactive open pit uranium mine site which endangered the local Navajos, and their livestock, and posed a general threat to wildlife and water resources in the surrounding area. Today, after reclamation, the site is free of sources of water pollution, soil erosion, sedimentation and radiation emission and is once again open to the community for livestock grazing.    Appalachian Region  -- The West Virginia Division of Environmental Protection's  Blackwater River Limestone Drum Reclamation Project  near the town of Davis in Tucker County, which eliminated one of the major sources of acid mine drainage in the state, and reestablished the Blackwater River as one of West Virginia's premier trout fishing areas. The project also improved water quality in other downstream rivers, including the Cheat, and the Ohio.     Mid-Continent Region  -- The Oklahoma Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program in partnership with the National Resources Conservation Service, Rural Abandoned Mine Program for developing the  Oklahoma Partnership Approach to Reclamation of Abandoned Mine Land . The two agencies pooled personnel and resources to complete a joint project to reclaim 26 acres of abandoned mine land on five separate sites in Rogers County, including one site where acid mine drainage was polluting the Claremore city water supply.       Western Region  -- The New Mexico Abandoned Mine Land Bureau's  Socorro West Mine Safeguard Project,  in Socorro County, for reclaiming 24 underground mine shafts, adits, and other dangerous openings at the abandoned Nancy and Black Canyon manganese mine sites. The reclamation included installing bat gates which help to preserve the habitat for one of the country's largest populations of Townsend's big-eared bats.     ""These national winners have established hallmarks of excellence for their outstanding dedication and efforts to reclaim abandoned mine lands and safeguard the environment,"" Karpan said. ""We deeply appreciate their hard work and extraordinary performance.""     The Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Awards Program was started in 1992, and is designed to publicly recognize outstanding abandoned mine land reclamation and publicize exemplary reclamation techniques.

GX241-39-1602298	"June 1, 2002  Mr. Chris Horyza, Assistance Representative Bureau of Land Management 21605 North 7th Avenue Phoenix, AZ 85027 Dear Chris, Enclosed is our report of the Community and Natural Resource Issues, the Management Concerns, and the Management and Partnership Opportunities for the planning area, as noted in the list of our task order Phase I deliverables. Taken as a whole, the planning area may seem to have a lot of issues and concerns. However, when viewed by Community Resource Units (CRU), the number is more manageable and issues are more actionable. Resolution of some issues is simply a matter of providing certain information to the right people. Some issues and concerns are found in only one or a few CRU's. Others are commonly held throughout the planning area. Trash is an example of the latter type. As was discussed in the Discovery workshop, working with communities to help them resolve their natural resource issues builds trust and momentum to work together on larger and tougher issues, such as land use plannng decisions. We offer a few general observations and recommendations about the report: We recommend this report be used as a living compilation of Issues, Concerns, and Opportunities organized by CRU. As we move through the planning process, new ones can be added and tracked. The report can help BLM Community Liaisons focus their discussions in the communities. The report can help BLM decide which issues are the most important ones to help communities resolve. Some partnership actions are already underway to resolve issues and concerns. Support those, help them succeed, and then build on those successes. Examples are: 1) fire safety coordination and community awareness in Mayer, Cordes Lakes, and Black   Canyon City, 2) trail location and designation efforts in Black Canyon City, 3) R&PP lease application in Black Canyon City. Pick ""the low-hanging fruit"". These are the opportunities to help resolve an issue that doesn't take a lot of BLM time or resources, but have a significant benefit to the community. Two examples are: determining jurisdiction and maintenance responsibilities for Constellation Road near Wickenburg, and working with Yavapai County Trails Council to designate the Black Canyon Hiking and Equestrian Trail extension. Some issues are highly actionable because there is widespread community support to do something now. Developing a citizen-based stewardship arrangement for Hassayampa Box Canyon in the Wickenburg CRU seems to be one such opportunity. Successful resolution builds trust and cooperation quickly, and the momentum can carry right into other elements of the planning process. Trash or illegal dumping is the most widespread issue across the planning area. The problem is everywhere and is getting worse as population increases. Trash cleanup costs agencies money and siphons away citizen energy from more productive collaboration. There is broad support to do something about it, but no one knows exactly what to do. We believe the issue is resolvable when approached on a regional scale driven by citizen action. BLM can facilitate resolution by working with citizen networks and local formal organizations. A comment about the Community Resource Units (CRU) - we will continue to fine-tune the boundaries of these units and perhaps even combine or adjust some of them as we complete the community assessment in the coming months. For now, the CRU's identified in the enclosed report are definitive enough to enable BLM to staff the culture and work with communities. We look forward to reviewing this document with your planning team and representatives of Jones and Stokes, the plan/EIS contractor. In the meantime, if there are any questions regarding the information in this report, please contact me.

The controversy has eased in Wickenburg in recent months (or shifted somewhat to Morristown). The Hwy 93 issue will again be discussed in coming years as the CanaMex route through the area is selected. A number of citizens are unhappy about The Nature Conservancy's establishment of the Hassayampa River Preserve. They omplain about loss of access to the river for activities they previously enjoyed - fishing, ATV travel, and camping. Several citizens and a local church representative expressed concern over increasingly insufficient low cost housing in Wickenburg. Lower income workers and citizens are looking westward toward Aguila and northward toward Congress for affordable housing.  Natural Resource Issues Some citizens expressed their belief that the BLM planning and EIS process is difficult to understand and to engage and they want to understand it better. Constellation Road is often in bad shape. Some residents want improvement and consistent maintenance of this road. Those expressing the need were unaware of who owns the road or is responsible for maintenance. Many protect hikers, occurs citizens regularly use the Hassayampa River Box Canyon and want to be able to the unique resources in the Canyon, yet permit reasonable access and use by picnickers, road use, trail use. Currently, trashing and environmental damage regularly.  Trash is an ongoing problem, especially in more heavily used areas, such as Box Canyon, Blue Tanks, and the Constellation Road. Citizen groups regularly have clean-up days to remove trash. In recent years it has been harder to get people and groups out to clean it  Page 3   up. Abandoned mines in the general Wickenburg area pose a potential threat of water pollution and citizen safety. Trails Trails are an important aspect of Wickenburg western history and heritage. Some citizens feel a strong need to locate and designate trails for motorized and non-motorized uses. Some trail access has already been lost to private development. A few citizens are reluctant to designate and map trail locations for fear of government intrusion or attracting too many users. ""If we tell people where the trails are or produce maps, we will be overrun."" [local trails user] ATV and motorcycle use is increasing in the Wickenburg area as population of users increase north and west of Phoenix. Increased use brings more conflict with other users as well as more renegade users who cause proportionately more resource damage. Land Tenure and Open Space Many people expressed confusion about land ownership. At times they don't know when they are on state lands or BLM lands. In everyday conversations, it was obvious that people were not clear in distinguishing the two, whether the location of trails, of public lands close to town and so on. There is a buried head in the sand mentality about State Trust lands, a sense that it will always be there. Vulture Peak is important to Wickenburg as a vista and from an historic perspective. Many citizens want to make sure it is protected from intrusive development, or development which would degrade visual quality. Several citizens advocated retaining BLM lands to the south and west of Wickenburg as a buffer against urban encroachment from metro Phoenix Several citizens at a Wickenburg meeting urged BLM to get the Arizona State Land Department involved in the BLM planning process - their experience is that State Lands avoids involvement in planning and is not responsive to citizens. Open range grazing Vulture Mine Road needs to be fenced off because of cattle. It is paved and is becoming a commuting road with fast traffic. [rancher]  Page 4   Management Concerns Recreational prospectors, or prospecting clubs, have group and family outings to work their claims. Numbers of people who show up are sometimes much greater than planned. Sometimes, the need for camping and parking space causes conflicts with other groups using that particular area.[BLM] ""State Trust lands in the Wickenburg area will be liquidated some day; there needs to be a buffer between Phoenix and Wickenburg"" [Wickenburg City Council member] There are numerous abandoned mines in nearby hills pose a safety hazard because of unmarked open shafts, as well as possible water quality problems. BLM has insufficient staff to inventory and safeguard dangerous sites. (BLM water specialist)  Management and Partnership Opportunities This planning effort presents a good opportunity to address several important issues related to land jurisdiction and land tenure. The opportunity is to engage key citizens and groups, the State Land Department, and local government and discuss land tenure options for BLM lands. Specifically, The Yavapai County General Plan revision and the Wickenburg General Plan are both well underway. This is an excellent time to align community vision and planning elements for overall consistency between plans. While Vulture Mine is private land, the larger portion of Vulture Peak is largely on BLM land. The viewshed and historical perspective the community values can be addressed in the planning process as lands to be retained, or preserved using other options such as R&PP lease Identifying BLM lands which could serve as a buffer between Phoenix urban development and Wickenburg and designating in the plan. Jurisdiction and responsibility for improvement and maintenance for Constellation Road can be determined. BLM can facilitate process for getting and keeping the road in shape. Work with recreation users to determine appropriate community-based strategies for trail designation, use, and maintenance. Is designation appropriate? Can designation be associated with ""adopt-a-trail"" by clubs and groups, both local and non-local? There is strong citizen identification with and a caretaking ethic for the Hassayampa Box Canyon. This support can easily evolve into a full stewardship effort for the Canyon. Work with local user groups and local government to develop a management framework for Box Canyon and follow through with appropriate designations or agreements.  Page 5   Yarnell CRU Community issues There is a strong community desire for no growth in Yarnell, although some elements of Yarnell want growth and jobs. Peeples Valley is generally pro-growth. Natural Resource Issues Several individuals in the Kirkland, Skull Valley, Wilhoit area are advocates of private property rights and are somewhat suspicious of government planning efforts. A citizens group in Yarnell has fought off a gold mining proposal in recent years. They are concerned that another proposal could resurface when gold prices are higher. There is some trash dumping associated with OHV and hunting activities.  Management Concerns Yarnell Chamber of Commerce representatives are concerned about stimulating economic development in Yarnell. They need trails and possibly land for summer camping and outdoor experiences. The Prescott National Forest is concerned about wild land-urban interface issues in communities near National Forest lands, especially related to fire safety. Prescott National Forest is developing a new fire management plan to address this concern. Numerous abandoned mines in nearby hills pose a safety hazard because of unmarked open shafts, as well as possible water quality problems. BLM has insufficient staff to inventory and safeguard dangerous sites. (BLM water specialist)  Management and Partnership Opportunities Key citizens and groups in the Yarnell CRU know they have important interests to protect. There is an opportunity to demonstrate how their interests can be considered through a citizen-driven planning process. One proposal the Yarnell Chamber has for economic development is getting BLM cooperation to develop a trail system, including Antelope Peak on BLM land. They are also interested in knowing more about R&PP leases for public facilities. There is an opportunity to employ youth from a local non-profit organization to locate, inventory, and sign abandoned mines.  Page 6   Tonopah Valley CRU Community issues In Tonopah Valley, residents have an ongoing concern about efforts to locate more power plants and transmission lines and large prisons, especially private prisons. They have fought off several attempts in recent years by developers to locate prisons there. Several large power generation plants are planned for construction near the Palo Verde facility. Communities must react to periodic fast growth with accompanying demand for infrastructure and schools.  Natural Resource Issues As Buckeye develops, commuting time to Tonopah, with cheaper land and more open space, is less than an hour. Trash dumping is becoming a larger issue as more people settle in the area and as metro Phoenix spreads westward. Some ATV and other off-road users drive all over the area without regard to existing routes, land ownership, or environmental impact. Use is increasing as Phoenix and Buckeye grow westward. The citizens understand that private and State Trust lands will eventually be developed and they want to identify and establish parks and other open space needed in the future.  Management concerns Tonopah Valley Community Council and Tonopah Valley Association want to be actively involved in RMP planning process, especially for designation of motorized routes and land tenure decisions. These two organizations have offered the use of their regular meetings and newsletters to communicate planning information to Tonopah Valley and Harquahela Valley citizens and to help facilitate the citizen involvement process. Tonopah Valley Community Council and Tonopah Valley Association have ongoing concerns about locations of power generating plants and associated transmission lines.  Management and Partnership Opportunities The BLM planning effort presents an opportunity to work with Tonopah Valley citizens to identify and designate BLM lands for future open space and parks using Conservation Agreements, R&PP leases or other means. Citizen based planning could also identify needs of Maricopa County and energy companies for transportation and utility corridors well in advance of their actual needs.  Page 7   Tonopah Valley citizens want to help identify and designate travel routes in the CRU as a means of controlling cross-country travel and protecting the desert environment and private lands.  Castle Hot Springs CRU Community Issues Remote locations cause long response time for Yavapai County emergency services fire, law enforcement, emergency medical services. Traveling rough roads providing access to homes and ranches on a daily basis takes a heavy toll on residents' vehicles, but improving the roads would bring more residents to the area. The current roads are a temporary barrier to more development. ""I spend three hours every day on these roads, but it's worth it to live up here"" (Pleasant View Estates resident) Ranching Some ranchers finding it more difficult to preserve ranching as a viable business and lifestyle. Prospects of leaving a viable ranching operation to kids are quickly diminishing. Ranchers believe the recreating public does not appreciate the role or value of ranching in land stewardship, preserving open space, or as a cultural/historical presence. Natural Resource Issues As Phoenix metro area grows, there are more ATV and off-road users traveling throughout area, resulting in more trash dumping, cutting ranch fences, speeding on narrow county roads, and shooting around ranch buildings and windmills. Some long time residents of Castle Hot Springs who once opposed Wilderness designations are now seeing such designations as a way of preserving the landscape, open space, and the western lifestyle.  Management Concerns Trash dumping continues to occur on many public and private lands. Periodic cleanup days co-sponsored by State Lands, BLM, and OHV groups provide only temporary relief and cost the BLM several thousand dollars annually just for dumpster rentals.  Page 8   Formal OHV groups who regularly use the area are very concerned that urban development will push OHV users out of the area, a continuing pattern for them. New subdivision with a golf course (Quintero) is being built on old mining claim surrounded by BLM land and in wild burro habitat. Burros, cattle, javelina, and other critters will be attracted to grass and will be seen as a nuisance to residents. There is a concern that BLM will be expected to mitigate the burro conflict. The concerns may also involve the Arizona Fish and Game as well. Continuing urban expansion means more intense demand for construction and landscaping materials - decorative gravel, boulders, construction aggregate. Much of the demand will be focused on BLM lands in the southern Bradshaws. Forest Service (Prescott National Forest) is concerned that more users in the southern Bradshaws will mean higher incidence of human-caused fires on public lands. Travel routes and OHV use BLM is concerned about accomplishing the large task of designating use of motorized routes in the planning process. The State Land Department is concerned that people recreate on State Trust lands without having permits and that there is widespread citizen misunderstanding about where State Trust lands are located and how they are managed. Ranching and recreation There is an opportunity here to educate the recreating public about ranch living, integrating ranching and recreational activities in ways that support both, economically and socially. A starting place might be putting local ranchers in touch with Rural Conservation & Development specialists and the Wickenburg Western Heritage Museum. Arizona Game and Fish has a state wide program (Sportsman/Landowner Respect Program) to encourage user organizations to adopt ranches in order to preserve access on and across private land for hunting and other uses - this program seems to have application in the Castle Hot Springs area. The BLM could become a partner in the program as well. Mining and prospecting Numerous abandoned mines in southern Bradshaws pose safety hazard because of unmarked open shafts and water quality problems. BLM has insufficient staff to inventory and safeguard dangerous sites. (BLM water specialist) Recreational prospecting by individuals and organized groups sometimes cause resource impacts such as camping and ground disturbance.  Page 9   Management and Partnership Opportunities Formal OHV organizations have indicated a strong desire to work with BLM and other landowners and users to inventory routes, collaborate in decisionmaking, maintain routes, and monitor use on routes. They and other users want their interests represented in the process. This is a good opportunity to have the groups help develop a citizen based process to make the route decisions early in the planning process. The Gold Prospectors Association of America (GPAA) has volunteered to work on BLM projects near Association claims. One such project could by identifying and inventorying abandoned mines and accomplishing some basic safeguarding at mines. This would not only get needed work done, but also build cooperation and trust between BLM and prospecting clubs. ""Just bring us a list of projects you want done."" [GPAA local president] Ranching and recreation There is an opportunity here to educate the recreating public about ranch living, integrating ranching and recreational activities in ways that support both, economically and socially. A starting place might be putting local ranchers in touch with Rural Conservation & Development specialists and the Wickenburg Western Heritage Museum. Arizona Game and Fish has a state wide program (Sportsman/Landowner Respect Program) to encourage user organizations to adopt ranches in order to preserve access on and across private land for hunting and other uses - this program seems to have application in the Castle Hot Springs area. The BLM could become a partner in the program as well.  North Phoenix/Peoria CRU Community Issues Urban Sprawl and Annexation The owner of an off-road race track on leased State Trust land northwest of Phoenix knows some day he will need to close or move his business because of residential development. The owner of an RV park annexed by Peoria found out the business was in Peoria three years later when the was hit with a bill for back taxes and an order to comply with city ordinances. ""Growth is so fast, the city can't even keep up with it themselves."" [RV park owner]  Page 10   Natural Resource Issues OHV and Recreation Activities The trend around Phoenix is that OHV users get pushed out farther and farther as urban development overtakes areas used for OHV use. OHV users we talked to on site expect to continue getting displaced.  Many people using desert in southern Bradshaws are unclear whether they are on State Trust lands, BLM lands, Forest Service lands, or private lands. They are also unclear about regulations for using different lands. This includes not knowing that a permit is needed to be on State Trust lands. ""The problem is that State lands have different regs than federal lands do and out in the desert it's difficult to know whose land you're on"". [motorcycle racetrack operator near Hwy 74] Fast growth in the Phoenix metropolitan area and the jobs created attracts people from all over the country, many of whom have little understanding or appreciation of desert ecosystems, land ownership patterns, and public land policies. Many people we talked to either expressed confusion about these topics or expressed the need for better education by the public land agencies. ""What public lands? You mean the desert? The desert is the desert; there is nothing out there."" [young hotel worker in northern Phoenix] Target Shooting Caswell shooting range manager (Tempe) is unhappy about shooters who shoot unsafely on public lands, damage property, and leave trash at shooting sites. He thinks it gives shooting and shooters a bad name with the general public, eventually will result in public lands being off-limits to shooting other than hunting. ""We're in real danger of losing our rights to use open areas for shooting - look at what happened on the Tonto Forest."" [shooting range manager]  Management Concerns As urban population expands there is continuing need for gravel and aggregate pits, communication sites and corridors for transportation routes, electric transmission lines, and natural gas lines feeding power generation plants west of Phoenix. Many of these facilities cross BLM lands, impacting resources and requiring extensive analyses. We need the cities and Maricopa County involved with planning out their saleable mineral needs so the BLM can be more proactive. [BLM realty staff] As urban development moves into previously undeveloped areas, target shooting in those  Page 11   areas pose a danger to residents and users of public lands. [BLM manager] OHV use in the southern Bradshaws is growing and resulting in heavier impacts to the land and resources. Impacts include soil erosion on hillsides and in washes, wildlife disturbance, and vegetation is damaged. [BLM biologist] The Arizona State Lands department is concerned that people use State Trust lands without permits, leases, or licenses, and often without knowing where they are or what the regulations are. Maricopa County is concerned about having adequate transportation corridors in place for future needs. Maricopa County is concerned about its ability to maintain 10 - 15 % of land set aside for open space in future growth areas. It is looking at BLM and State Trust lands as sources of future open space. Staffing and volunteerism Staffing for law enforcement, environmental education, and field specialists is inadequate to keep up with growing pressure on BLM lands. Many specialists feel overwhelmed by workload and feel like they are always in a reactive mode. [BLM biologist] The BLM Phoenix Field Office managers have numerous offers from numerous groups and individuals to volunteer in a wide variety of capacities. Some volunteers Managers would like to take advantage of additional volunteer opportunities, but believe they don't have time or staffing to effectively manage volunteer programs. Volunteerism and staffiing  Management and Partnership Opportunities Caswell commercial shooting range (Tempe) has offered to work with other shooting ranges, with public land agencies, sporting goods stores, and shooting organizations such as NRA and Friends of NRA to promote shooting and conservation safety and ethics on public lands. Ideas include sponsoring ads in NRA/sporting publications, sponsoring public service announcements (psa's), posting flyers in stores and ranges, publicizing ethics in shooting safety courses, publicizing phone numbers of law enforcement to report unsafe shooting and illegal trash dumping on public lands. The local chapters of two national gold prospecting associations have offered to do volunteer projects on BLM lands. This could be matched with the need to locate and inventory abandoned mines in the Wickenburg and Castle Hot Springs CRU's.  Page 12   Buckeye CRU Community Issues There is citizen support to preserving the old town flavor of the old Buckeye. Some second- and third-generation farming families are looking to sell their land. The children do not want to farm. So the lands will likely be sold for development. ""The farmers are becoming realtors around here"" [local realtor] Buckeye city limits stretch nearly to Highway 74. Growth seems to be a foregone conclusion, although not everybody in favor of it. Several citizens expressed the need to keep working with developers so that open space, affordable housing, and community amenities are included.  Natural Resource issues Ranchers are experiencing more damage from ATV users running through private lands and public lands. ""They're destroying public lands."" [rancher in Rainbow Valley] Monuments Several citizens showed a lack of understanding of the regulations for using BLM National Monument lands. A few expressed their belief that the Monuments were closed to vehicular travel. Open space and natural corridors There is interest in Buckeye community to understand how R&PP leases work. Several citizens are interested in options available for using public lands for open space and community public purposes. They believe all State Trust lands will be fully developed. Citizens in Buckeye and the White Tanks area are recognizing some of the benefits of leaving open space areas and natural corridors linking open spaces. The corridors would include room for plant and animal habitat and for citizen trails. Some White Tanks area residents want to enlarge White Tanks park. They also advocate limiting development to slopes of 15% or less. Illegal dumping Trash and illegal dumping is an ever increasing issue on public and private lands. As the Phoenix area grows, the problem grows with it.  Page 13   OHV use OHV use occurs on desert land in general, with little apparent distinction between jurisdictions.  Management Concerns The State Land Department is concerned that people recreate on State Trust lands without having permits and that there is widespread citizen misunderstanding about where State Trust lands are located and how they are managed. The park ranger at White Tanks expressed concern over the heavily increasing visitor use and inadequate staffing by Maricopa County. Some of the increasing impacts are trash dumping, graffiti, and rowdy behavior. A recent fee increase hasn't apparently lessened the public use. Maricopa County and City of Buckeye are concerned about having adequate transportation corridors identified for future needs. Maricopa County is concerned about its ability to maintain 10 - 15 % of land set aside for open space in future growth areas. It is looking at BLM and State Trust lands as sources of future open space.  Management and Partnership Opportunities Multi-jurisdictional planning Buckeye seems to be in an early stage of growth and at an appropriate time to define specific needs for future open spaces and corridors. The BLM planning process involving the City of Buckeye, Maricopa County, Native American Tribes, Arizona Game and Fish, and the State Land Department, through a citizen-driven process, could explore ways to meet the collective goals of citizens and agencies. The planning process is an excellent vehicle for citizens to learn current regulations and future management options for various land categories, including State Trust lands, BLM Monument lands, and other BLM lands. An R&PP lease application is apparently underway for a Motocross park. There is some interest in exploring other potential applications as well, such as a senior citizen center or parks.  Page 14   New River/Cave Creek/Carefree CRU Community Issues New River has tried to incorporate in past; the issue comes up every few years. This issue seems to center around a desire to have more local control of growth, planning, and zoning, versus the additional requirements and costs of incorporation.  Natural Resource Issues Many residential areas in New River consist of 1-2 acre tracts - as more people move ""into the country"" they buy an ATV and take off across countryside without regard to ownership or regulations or environmental concerns - a growing problem (newspaper publisher) New River is in process of expanding or adding to a BLM R&PP lease for the Kiwanis Park and Senior Center on north edge of village. Trash is left by users of desert lands (public and private) and by travelers from I-17. Community groups and local ranchers regularly clean up trash left by others.  Management Concerns Cave Creek residents and Tonto National Forest are concerned about shooting on Forest land adjacent to Cave Creek and Carefree. The Tonto National Forest has instituted closure on shooting for 80,000 acres on Forest land. Cave Creek and New River and Carefree experiencing rapid growth resulting in heavy impacts on National Forest resources adjacent to those communities and increased user conflicts. (Tonto NF planner) User groups have complained about confusing regulations on Forest lands and are pressuring National Forests to develop consistent off-road policies for all Forests. Arizona Game and Fish Department is concerned about losing access by hunters to use of private lands for hunting and losing access across private lands to public lands. They have a program to have OHV and hunting groups to work cooperatively with ranchers and landowners.  Management and Partnership Opportunities A goal expressed by several citizens in the New River community is to someday have a place dedicated for families to safely enjoy off-road and ATV activities. Currently, many  Page 15   ATV enthusiasts use private and State Trust lands, often without permission. Idea discussed by a local rancher and an off-road club is to develop a creed/ethics card for off-roading, emphasizing safety, environmental respect, respect for private property rights, respect for other users, etc. Off-road groups and public land agencies could cosponsor such an approach. Arizona Game and Fish has a program (Sportsman/Landowner Respect Program) to encourage user organizations to adopt ranches in order to preserve access on and across private land for hunting and other uses - one example is on East Table Mesa Road. This program could be expanded.  Black Canyon City CRU Community Issues Many citizens believe they get inadequate share of Yavapai County services, such as law enforcement, road maintenance, parks, medical emergency services. Some citizens believe Black Canyon City needs to incorporate in order to avoid being annexed by Peoria or Phoenix. This issue has come up every few years as a topic of community debate but not enough support has yet existed to move it forward. Some citizens expressed the need for more activities for young people, in addition to the BMX track. A related opinion expressed by Canon School administrators is that, in general, it is difficult to get local parents involved with their children's education or other activities.  Natural Resource Issues Access Many citizens want access preserved to public lands and the activities they currently enjoy, such as horseback riding, hiking, off-road riding, ATV riding, recreational prospecting, rock-hounding, shooting, hunting. Citizens in Black Canyon City have expressed concern about losing access to public lands. ""Just leave things the way they are"". [longtime local resident] Local members of OHV groups believe they are continually forced out of areas they use because of encroaching urban development. They would like to be involved in a planning process that result in retaining access to roads and trails in the future. Several citizens expressed frustration in not having easy access to maps of public lands in the area.  Page 16   Some citizens don't agree with the way State Trust lands are managed. For example, they resent needing to have permits to enter State Trust Lands. Illegal Dumping Many citizens are frustrated about illegal dumping of trash on public and private lands, especially items which are expensive to take to the transfer station, such as appliances, furniture, automobiles, and tires. Some citizens have expressed concern with target shooting in areas where residences and other public land users are present.  Management Concerns The BLM and the Forest Service are concerned about fire danger in and around communities adjacent to public lands. The Black Canyon City Fire Department is concerned about fire safety of local residents, especially during this drought season. People use State Trust lands without permits, leases, or licenses, and often without knowing. There is a lack of citizen understanding of regulations for use of and locations of State Trust lands. [State Lands department OHV specialist]  Management and Partnership Opportunities Illegal Dumping There is a lot of energy in the community to work toward resolution of this issue. Local individuals, OHV clubs, a gold prospector association, local media, local businesses, and federal, state, and local government agencies all express a need to address the problem. Fire Safety The BLM and the Black Canyon City Fire Department have recently begun discussing ways to demonstrate community and residential fire safety practices to local citizens. This is an immediate and relatively easy to build social capital (trust and cooperation) within the community and with the BLM. Access Representatives of OHV groups have offered to help BLM inventory routes, monitor environmental conditions on roads, perform maintenance, and collaborate with other route users to develop integrated management strategies and decisions. The Black Canyon City Riders are working with the BLM to locate and designate several sections of trails in order to enhance riding and hiking opportunities around the  Page 17   community and to tie in with the Black Canyon Trail system. They are willing to help maintain and monitor the trails as well. Land Tenure Several opportunities for partnering between BLM and citizen groups to acquire BLM lands for community uses. The High Desert Helpers are in the process of acquiring the use of BLM land for expansion of High Desert Park. Some citizens are interested in BLM lands on west side of Agua Fria as a community greenbelt. The Helpers are getting help from a BLM specialist in the application processes and this need to continue on a deliberate basis (staffing the culture). The Black Canyon City Community Association is interested in longer term acquisition of BLM lands or leases in order to provide private land for future community expansion as well as for public uses such as schools, fire stations, and community centers. The Association is exploring ways to identify their long term needs and to express that in the BLM planning process. Many Citizens of Black Canyon City want to have BLM retain much of the lands in the Black Canyon area in public ownership which provide a buffer against urban development, and for their value as view sheds, vistas and open space. The opportunity is to help the community understand the planning options available and the appropriate ways to provide the BLM guidance for land tenure decisions in the plan. Agua Fria National Monument Although not likely as a ""gateway"" village to the Agua Fria National Monument, several citizens and the Chamber of Commerce have expressed interests in participating in economic aspects of managing the Monument, such as tourism information, guided tours, maps, and special events. Canyon Creek Ranch, a local outfitter, has offered to perform trail maintenance and monitor resource condition in conjunction with permitted use on the Monument. The local rock hounding club, the Braggin' Rock Club, is interested in volunteering to help the BLM gather information on the Monument and to help monitor sites.  Mayer - Cordes CRU Community Issues The community would like to have an alternate route south through Black Canyon corridor paralleling I-17 for emergencies when I-17 is blocked by accident, or in case of emergency. In Spring Valley, the residents are negotiating the appropriate Covenants, Codes and  Page 18   Restrictions (CC&R's) and coordinating volunteers to complete construction of some features in their community park. Cordes Lakes Homeowners Association needs more facilities for young people and is currently trying to acquire land and facilities for Boys and Girls Clubs. Big Bug Economic Alliance has expressed need for Regional transportation for senior citizens who don't drive well any more to travel from small communities to Prescott and to Phoenix for medical and other needs. Retaining rural character and open space is an important value and an emerging citizen issue as well, with the area growing in population.  Natural Resource Issues Access Cordes Lakes wants the primitive road heading south and east of town improved for an alternate escape route in case of fire or other emergency at Cordes Junction. There is confusion among some residents about boundaries of State Trust lands, private lands, and BLM lands locally and the differences in policies for public use of those lands. Big Bug Economic Alliance is needing to update the community land use plan for the area and wants to include the BLM in the process. Yavapai County Trails Council wants to locate and designate Black Canyon Hiking and Equestrian Trail extension from Highway 69 north to the Prescott National Forest Boundary. Several Spring Valley and Mayer residents expressed concern over damage to cultural resource sites on BLM land north of Mayer - several citizens want sites protected better. There is widespread concern and significant opposition expressed about the proposed BLM/Aranda land exchange. Main objections seem to center on water supply issues, loss of open space, damage to cultural resources, and uncertainty about possible development on selected lands. Trash and illegal dumping continues to be a problem on public lands (State Trust, BLM and USFS) and private lands, especially dumping of tires and appliances. Water Many residents are concerned about having enough water for current and future homes and businesses  Page 19   Management Concerns Prescott National Forest is concerned that if proposed BLM/Aranda land exchange is consummated, there would be more residential development next to Forest lands, bringing more impacts to natural resources, such as illegal dumping, ATV use, target shooting and more human-caused fires. The State Land Department and BLM are concerned about illegal dumping on public lands in the area. Yavapai County is concerned about providing some services to fast growing rural areas, such as public safety, roads, parks, and regulatory review. BLM specialist working on large backlog to inventory water rights and water sources on Agua Fria National Monument. Water rights on Monument is necessary to ensure water for future management of resources there - rights needed to be registered with State because land was acquired from State Trust. The State Land Department is concerned that people recreate on State Trust lands without having permits and that there is widespread citizen misunderstanding about where State Trust lands are located and how they are managed. The community of Cordes Junction is concerned that the Arizona Department of Transportation's (ADOT) reconstruction of junction of Highway 69 and I-17 serves the community's needs. Fire safety The BLM and the Forest Service are concerned about fire danger in and around communities adjacent to public lands. Prescott National Forest is concerned about wild land-urban interface issues around Prescott and other nearby communities, especially related to fire safety. Prescott National Forest is developing a new fire management plan to address this concern.  Management and Partnership Opportunities Citizen Harold Martin and Big Bug Economic Alliance has offered to help coordinate the community planning effort for BLM for lands from Dewey-Humboldt to Black Canyon City and the communities in between, using community-based process similar to the one used in 1996. BLM is currently working with the Yavapai County Trails Council to locate, designate and protect an extension of the Black Canyon Hiking and Equestrian Trail. The work so far has built a great deal of trust between the Council and BLM. Follow through on the project will be a huge win-win for both parties and the hiking/equestrian public.  Page 20   Agua Fria National Monument Harold Martin has offered to coordinate the development of a visitor information center at Cordes Junction serving Cordes Lakes communities, Agua Fria National Monument, other BLM lands, Prescott and Tonto National Forest attractions, State Trust lands, and surrounding communities. Mr. Martin also offered to help organize community efforts to help plan, monitor conditions and use, and patrol roads on the Monument. Fire Safety The BLM and the local officials in Mayer have recently begun discussing ways to demonstrate community and residential fire safety practices to local citizens. This is an immediate and relatively easy way to build social capital (trust and cooperation) within the community and with the BLM.  Dewey Humboldt CRU Community issues Community Planning and zoning for the Yavapai County General Plan revision is well underway. Implementation of current zoning is an ongoing issue in Dewey-Humboldt as some residents feel that exceptions to the zoning plan are made too easily in order to accommodate every proposal and for short term benefits at the expense of longer term community interests. Retaining rural character and open space is an important goal of community planning and is included int the Yavapai County General Plan revision; several citizens expressed concern that as communities continue to grow, rural character is being lost. As the rural communities grow and struggle with local control of growth, several members of Dewey-Humboldt Community Organization recommend they consider incorporation. Dewey Humboldt is trying to find land to develop little League baseball fields for their youngsters.  Natural resource issues Some citizens want to retain BLM lands for future open space and recreational opportunities. Trash and illegal dumping continues to be an issue for public lands and private lands. The proposed BLM/Aranda land exchange is resulting in widespread community interest and reactions. Many citizens express oppositiion to the proposed trade, citing concerns about insufficient water supply, loss of open space,  Page 21   Some citizens and groups (including the Yavapai County Trails Council) want to designate some non-motorized trails for horse and hiking only. One such trail is the Black Canyon Hiking and Equestrian Trail. Access Some citizens want to be able to easily obtain land ownership maps and other information on regulations for use of State Trust Lands, BLM lands, National Forest lands, and BLM Monument lands. Some residents in Dewey-Humboldt community are worried about losing access to BLM lands on a road passing through private land which is being closed by land developer. Water Water for current and future homes and businesses is a widely held existing issue throughout the rural area from Prescott Valley to Mayer and Cordes Lakes. The issue is rapidly growing in intensity as new proposals for residential development and BLM land exchange are revealed. Management concerns Prescott National Forest is concerned about wild land-urban interface issues around Prescott and other nearby communities, especially related to fire safety. Prescott National Forest is developing a new fire management plan to address this concern. The National Forests of Arizona are developing a set of policies to manage OHV use more consistantly on National Forest lands. The Prescott National Forest is chairing the effort in Arizona. The State Land Department is concerned that people recreate on State Trust lands without having permits and that there is widespread citizen misunderstanding about where State Trust lands are located and how they are managed. Yavapai County is concerned about planning and securing enough transportation corridors between Cordes and Prescott to meet future needs of rapidly growing population. Yavapai County is concerned with retaining quality of life aspects of the area and also accommodating rapid residential and commercial growth.  Management and Partnership Opportunities Citizen Harold Martin and Big Bug Economic Alliance has offered to help coordinate a citizen based planning effort for BLM lands from Dewey-Humboldt to Black Canyon City and the communities in between, using community-based process similar to the one  Page 22   used in 1996. Fire Safety There is an opportunity for the BLM and local officials in Cordes Lakes to demonstrate community and residential fire safety practices to local citizens. This is an immediate and relatively easy way to build social capital (trust and cooperation) within the community and with the BLM.  Page 23"
GX020-61-15556596	Release Number: 2000-14   For Release: 12/01/99       MINE CLOSURE PLAN APPROVED     Plans for the final closure of the Wind Mountain open pit gold mine south of Gerlach has been approved by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Winnemucca Field Office. Included with the closure plan is a reclamation program. Completion of reclamation at the Wind Mountain Mine will return much of the area to pre-mining uses.     During the period of active operation the mine was owned by Amax Gold Corp. and operated by Wind Mountain Mining, Inc. The current owner is Kinross Gold USA, Inc. The mine produced about 300,000 ounces of gold.     The reclamation and closure plan was subjected to a period of public comment. It includes provisions for recontouring and seeding of the heap leach and other disturbed areas, removal of structures, disposal of heap leach effluent, solution pond closure and monitoring of reclamation and closure status.     BLM has worked closely with the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection to finalize reclamation, closure, bonding and monitoring of the Wind Mountain Mine. Although large piles of recontoured rock remain, the reclaimed area will provide wildlife habitat and prevent any future adverse impacts to water quality.     - BLM -        For More Information Contact:  Delores Cates at 775-623-1500 or Bob Stewart at 775-861-6586                                 Go  HOME

In the case of an entry each horse making up the entry shall carry the same number (head and saddlecloth) with a distinguishing letter.  For example, 1-1A, 1X.  In the case of a field the horses comprising the field shall carry an individual number; i.e., 12, 13, 14, 15, and so on. (( (4) ))  (3)  After the horses enter the track, no jockey shall dismount and no horse shall be entitled to the care of an attendant without consent of the stewards or the starter, and the horse must be free of all hands other than those of the jockey or assistant starter before the starter releases the barrier. (( (5) ))  (4)  In case of accident to a jockey, his mount or equipment, the stewards or the starter may permit the jockey to dismount and the horse to be cared for during the delay, and may permit all jockeys to dismount and all horses to be attended during the delay.

(( (7) ))  (6)  After entering the track not more than 12 minutes shall be consumed in the parade of the horses to the post except in cases of unavoidable delay.  After passing the stand once, horses will be allowed to break formation and canter, warm up or go as they please to the post.  When horses have reached the post, they shall be started without unnecessary delay. (( (8) ))  (7)  If the jockey is so injured on the way to the post as to require another jockey, the horse shall be taken to the paddock and another jockey obtained. (( (9) ))  (8)  No person shall wilfully delay the arrival of a horse at the post. (( (10) ))  (9)  No person other than the rider, starter, or assistant starter shall be permitted to strike a horse, or attempt, by shouting or otherwise to assist it in getting a start.

(( (1) The starter shall give orders to secure a fair start.  After reasonable efforts, if a horse cannot be led or backed into position, the starter shall order the horse to be taken to the outside.  The start must not be delayed on account of bad-mannered horses.  When the stall gate is used, it shall be placed on the track at the discretion of the starter. (2) The starter is required to load horses into the starting gate in order of post position:  Provided, That the starter may load known fractious horses out of order at his discretion. (3) All races shall be started by a starting gate approved by the commission, except that with permission of the stewards a race may be started without a gate.  When a race is started with or without a gate, there shall be no start until, and no recall after, the assistant starter has dropped his flag in answer to that of the starter. (4) If a horse is locked in the gate, the starter shall immediately notify the stewards who in turn shall immediately notify the manager of pari-mutuel department.  The starter shall be the sole judge of what horse or horses are prevented from starting in a race through failure of gates to open. )) (1) The starter is responsible for assuring that each participant receives a fair start. (2) If, when the starter dispatches the field, any door at the front of the starting gate stalls should not open properly due to a mechanical failure or malfunction or should any action by any starting personnel directly cause a horse to receive an unfair start, the stewards may declare such a horse a non-starter. (3) Should a horse, not scratched prior to the start, not be in the starting gate stall thereby causing it to be left when the field is dispatched by the starter, the horse shall be declared a non-starter by the stewards. (4) Should an accident or malfunction of the starting gate, or other unforeseeable event compromise the fairness of the race or the safety of race participants, the stewards may declare individual horses to be non-starters, exclude individual horses from one or more parimutuel pools or declare a ""no contest"" and refund all wagers except as otherwise provided in the rules involving multi-race wagers.

(( (1) When clear, a horse may be taken to any part of the course, except that crossing or weaving in front of contenders may constitute interference or intimidation for which the offender may be disciplined. (2) A horse crossing so as actually to impede another horse is disqualified, unless the impeded horse was partly in fault or the crossing was wholly caused by the fault of some other horse or jockey. (3) If a horse or jockey jostle another horse, the aggressor may be disqualified, unless the jostled horse or his jockey was partly in fault or the jostle was wholly caused by the fault of some other horse or jockey. (4) If a jockey wilfully strikes another horse or jockey, or rides wilfully or carelessly so as to injure another horse, which is in no way in fault, or so as to cause other horses to do so, his horse is disqualified. (5) When a horse is disqualified under this rule the other horse or horses in the same race coupled as an entry under  WAC 260-48-110  may be disqualified. (6) Complaints under this rule can only be received from the owner, trainer or jockey of the horse alleged to be aggrieved, and must be made to the clerk of the scales or to the stewards before or immediately after his jockey has passed the scales.  But nothing in this rule shall prevent the stewards taking cognizance of foul riding. (7) Any jockey against whom a foul is claimed shall be given the opportunity to appear before the stewards before any decision is made by them. (8) A jockey whose horse has been disqualified or who unnecessarily causes his horse to shorten his stride with a view to complaint, or an owner, trainer or jockey who complains frivolously that his horse was crossed or jostled, may be punished. (9) All horses are expected to give their best efforts in races in which they run, and any instructions or advice to jockeys to ride or handle their mounts otherwise than for the purpose of winning are forbidden and will subject all persons giving or following such instructions or advice to disciplinary action by the stewards and the commission. (10) No jockey carrying a whip during a race shall fail to use the whip in a manner consistent with using his best efforts to win.  Jockeys are prohibited from whipping a horse during the post parade, over the head, or in an excessive or brutal manner. )) (1) All horses shall be ridden out in every race.  A jockey shall not ease up or coast to the finish, without reasonable cause, even if the horse has no apparent chance to win prize money.  A jockey shall give a best effort during a race, and each horse shall be ridden to win.  No jockey shall unnecessarily cause his/her horse to shorten its stride so as to give the appearance of having suffered a foul. (2) If a jockey strikes or touches another jockey or another jockey's horse or equipment, his/her mount may be disqualified. (3) When clear in a race a horse may be ridden to any part of the course, but if any horse swerves, or is ridden to either side, so as to interfere with, impede or intimidate any other horse, it may be disqualified; (4) A horse which interferes with another and thereby causes any other horse to lose ground or position or causes any other horse to break stride, when such other horse is not at fault and when such interference occurs in a part of the race where the horse interfered with loses the opportunity to place where it might, in the opinion of the stewards be reasonably be expected to finish, may be disqualified; (5) If the stewards determine the foul was intentional, or due to careless riding, the jockey may be held responsible; (6) In a straightaway race, every horse must maintain position as nearly as possible in the lane in which it starts.  If a horse is ridden, drifts or swerves out of its lane in such a manner that it interferes with, impedes or intimidates another horse, it is a foul and may result in the disqualification of the offending horse. (7) When the stewards determine that a horse shall be disqualified, they may place the offending horse behind such horses as in their judgment it interfered with, or they may place it last; (8) If a horse is disqualified, any horse or horses with which it is coupled as an entry may also be disqualified; (9) When a horse is disqualified in a time trial race, for the purposes of qualifying only, it shall receive the time of the horse it is placed behind plus one-hundredth of a second penalty or more exact measurement if photo finish equipment permits, and shall be eligible to qualify for the finals or consolations of the race on the basis of the assigned time; (10) Possession of any electrical or mechanical stimulating or shocking device by a jockey, horse owner, trainer or other person authorized to handle or attend to a horse shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of these rules and is sufficient grounds for the stewards to scratch or disqualify the horse; (11) The stewards may determine that a horse shall be unplaced for the purpose of purse distribution and time trial qualification. (12) No jockey carrying a whip during a race shall fail to use the whip in a manner consistent with using his/her best efforts to win. (13) Any jockey who uses a whip during the running of a race is prohibited from whipping a horse: (a) in an excessive or brutal manner; (b) on the head, flanks, or on any part of its body other then the shoulders or hind quarters; (c) during the post parade except when necessary to control the horse; (d) when the horse is clearly out of the race.

(1) Permission must be obtained from a steward to exercise a horse between races .  (( unless the horse is being warmed up on the way to and just prior to entering the paddock for the next race to be run. )) (( (2) When a horse is being so warmed up before entering the paddock, his official program number shall be displayed by the rider. )) (( (3) ))  (2)  In a race, each horse shall carry a conspicuous saddlecloth number and a head number, corresponding to his number on the official program.  In the case of an entry each horse making up the entry shall carry the same number (head and saddlecloth) with a distinguishing letter.  For example, 1-1A, 1X.  In the case of a field the horses comprising the field shall carry an individual number; i.e., 12, 13, 14, 15, and so on. (( (4) ))  (3)  After the horses enter the track, no jockey shall dismount and no horse shall be entitled to the care of an attendant without consent of the stewards or the starter, and the horse must be free of all hands other than those of the jockey or assistant starter before the starter releases the barrier. (( (5) ))  (4)  In case of accident to a jockey, his mount or equipment, the stewards or the starter may permit the jockey to dismount and the horse to be cared for during the delay, and may permit all jockeys to dismount and all horses to be attended during the delay. (( (6) ))  (5)  All horses shall parade and, under penalty of disqualification, shall carry their weight from the paddock to the starting post, such parade to pass the steward's stand. (( (7) ))  (6)  After entering the track not more than 12 minutes shall be consumed in the parade of the horses to the post except in cases of unavoidable delay.  After passing the stand once, horses will be allowed to break formation and canter, warm up or go as they please to the post.  When horses have reached the post, they shall be started without unnecessary delay. (( (8) ))  (7)  If the jockey is so injured on the way to the post as to require another jockey, the horse shall be taken to the paddock and another jockey obtained. (( (9) ))  (8)  No person shall wilfully delay the arrival of a horse at the post. (( (10) ))  (9)  No person other than the rider, starter, or assistant starter shall be permitted to strike a horse, or attempt, by shouting or otherwise to assist it in getting a start. (( (11) ))  (10)  In all races in which a jockey will not ride with a whip, an announcement of that fact shall be made over the public address system.

(( (1) The starter shall give orders to secure a fair start.  After reasonable efforts, if a horse cannot be led or backed into position, the starter shall order the horse to be taken to the outside.  The start must not be delayed on account of bad-mannered horses.  When the stall gate is used, it shall be placed on the track at the discretion of the starter. (2) The starter is required to load horses into the starting gate in order of post position:  Provided, That the starter may load known fractious horses out of order at his discretion. (3) All races shall be started by a starting gate approved by the commission, except that with permission of the stewards a race may be started without a gate.  When a race is started with or without a gate, there shall be no start until, and no recall after, the assistant starter has dropped his flag in answer to that of the starter. (4) If a horse is locked in the gate, the starter shall immediately notify the stewards who in turn shall immediately notify the manager of pari-mutuel department.  The starter shall be the sole judge of what horse or horses are prevented from starting in a race through failure of gates to open. )) (1) The starter is responsible for assuring that each participant receives a fair start. (2) If, when the starter dispatches the field, any door at the front of the starting gate stalls should not open properly due to a mechanical failure or malfunction or should any action by any starting personnel directly cause a horse to receive an unfair start, the stewards may declare such a horse a non-starter. (3) Should a horse, not scratched prior to the start, not be in the starting gate stall thereby causing it to be left when the field is dispatched by the starter, the horse shall be declared a non-starter by the stewards. (4) Should an accident or malfunction of the starting gate, or other unforeseeable event compromise the fairness of the race of the safety of race participants, the stewards may declare individual horses to be non-starters, exclude individual horses from one or more parimutuel pools or declare a ""no contest"" and refund all wagers except as otherwise provided in the rules involving multi-race wagers.

ACTION: Interim rule and request for comments.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: We are amending the imported fire ant regulations by  designating as quarantined areas portions of two counties in  California. As a result of this action, the interstate movement of  regulated articles from those areas will be restricted. This action is  necessary to prevent the artificial spread of the imported fire ant to  noninfested areas of the United States. We are also amending the  treatment provisions in the Appendix to the imported fire ant  regulations by lowering the dosage rate of bifenthrin wettable powder  for the treatment of containerized nursery plants.  DATES: This interim rule is effective November 5, 1999. We invite you  to comment on this docket. We will consider all comments that we  receive by January 4, 2000.  ADDRESSES: Please send your comment and three copies to: Docket No. 99- 078-1, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, Suite 3C03,  4700 River Road, Unit 118, Riverdale, MD 20737-1238.

APHIS documents published in the Federal Register, and related  information, including the names of organizations and individuals who  have commented on APHIS rules, are available on the Internet at http:// www.aphis.usda.gov/rad/webrepor.html.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Ronald P. Milberg, Operations  Officer, Program Support, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 134,  Riverdale, MD 20737-1236; (301) 734-5255.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Background      The imported fire ant regulations (contained in 7 CFR 301.81  through 301.81-10, and referred to below as the regulations) quarantine  infested States or infested areas within States and impose restrictions  on the interstate movement of regulated articles for the purpose of  preventing the artificial spread of the imported fire ant.     The imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren and Solenopsis  richteri Forel, is an aggressive, stinging insect that, in large  numbers, can seriously injure and even kill livestock, pets, and  humans. The imported fire ant feeds on crops and builds large, hard  mounds that damage farm and field machinery. The imported fire ant is  not native to the United States. The regulations prevent the imported  fire ant from spreading throughout its ecological range within this  country.     The regulations in Sec. 301.81-3 provide that the Administrator of  the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will list as a  quarantined area each State, or each portion of a State, that is  infested with the imported fire ant. The Administrator will designate  less than an entire State as a quarantined area only under the  following conditions: (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing  restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles  listed in Sec. 301.81-2 that are equivalent to the interstate movement  restrictions imposed by the regulations; and (2) designating less than  the entire State will prevent the spread of the imported fire ant. The  Administrator may include uninfested acreage within a quarantined area  due to its proximity to an infestation or its inseparability from an  infested locality for quarantine purposes.     We are amending Sec. 301.81-3(e) by designating additional portions  of Los Angeles and Riverside Counties in California as quarantined  areas. We are taking this action because recent surveys conducted by  APHIS and State and county agencies reveal that the imported fire ant  has spread to these areas. See the rule portion of this document for  specific descriptions of the new quarantined areas.     We are also revising the dosage rate of a treatment described in  the Appendix to the regulations. Sections 301.81-4 and 301.81-5 of the  regulations provide, among other things, that regulated articles  requiring treatment before interstate movement must be treated in  accordance with the methods and procedures prescribed in the Appendix  to the imported fire ant regulations. The Appendix sets forth the  treatment provisions of the ``Imported Fire Ant Program Manual.'' We  are amending paragraph III.C.4. of the Appendix by changing the dosage  rate of bifenthrin wettable powder from 50 ppm to 25 ppm. On December  4, 1992, we published a final rule in the Federal Register at 57 CFR  57322-57335 (Docket No. 86-328-2) that lowered the dosage rate of  granular bifenthrin from 50 ppm to 25 ppm for the treatment of  containerized nursery plants. The dosage rate for bifenthrin wettable  powder was not changed at that time. However, bifenthrin wettable  powder has been proven effective for the treatment of containerized  nursery plants at a dosage rate of 25 ppm, and that dosage rate is  consistent with current product labeling approved by the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency. The lower dosage rate will prevent  unnecessary use of the pesticide.  Emergency Action      The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  has determined that an emergency exists that warrants publication of  this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment.  Immediate action to quarantine newly infested areas is necessary to  prevent the artificial spread of the imported fire ant into noninfested  areas of the United States. Immediate  [[Page 60334]]  action to change the dosage rate for bifenthrin wettable powder is  necessary to prevent unnecessary use of the pesticide.     Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to  this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under  these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make this  action effective upon publication in the Federal Register. We will  consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of  this rule in the Federal Register. After the comment period closes, we  will publish another document in the Federal Register. The document  will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments  we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.  Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act      This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this  action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review  process required by Executive Order 12866.     This action amends the imported fire ant regulations by designating  portions of Los Angeles and Riverside Counties in California as  quarantined areas. As a result of this action, the interstate movement  of regulated articles from those areas will be restricted. This action  is necessary on an emergency basis to prevent the artificial spread of  the imported fire ant to noninfested areas of the United States. We are  also amending the Appendix to the imported fire ant regulations by  changing the dosage rate of a chemical to reduce its use and the costs  associated with its use.     This emergency situation makes compliance with section 603 and  timely compliance with section 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5  U.S.C. 601 et seq.) impracticable. If we determine that this rule would  have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small  entities, then we will discuss the issues raised by section 604 of the  Regulatory Flexibility Act in our final regulatory flexibility  analysis.  Executive Order 12372      This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic  Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372,  which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local  officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.)  Executive Order 12988      This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12988,  Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws  and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no  retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings  before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.  National Environmental Policy Act      An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact  have been prepared for this program. The assessment provides a basis  for the conclusion that the methods employed to regulate the imported  fire ant will not significantly affect the quality of the human  environment. Based on the finding of no significant impact, the  Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has  determined that an environmental impact statement need not be prepared.     The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact  were prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy  Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), (2)  regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for implementing  the procedural provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA  regulations implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS' NEPA  Implementing Procedures (7 CFR part 372).

Work began early in October; in mid-October, the cows moved in.      The project utilizes the feeding of cows in temporary high-density livestock feedlots. Through the ""hoof action"" of the cows, organic matter is incorporated into the soil; in addition, the cows till native seeds into the soil.      A newly-built perimeter fence protects the site from cattle and recreational vehicle use until revegetation is established. Temporary enclosures of about 1 acre (within the perimeter fence) have been built with electric fencing. Cows stay in these temporary feedlots for approximately 4-5 days; placement of water and feed supplements ensures ""hoof action"" over the total area. Each enclosure will be seeded with native seed before the cows permanently leave the enclosure.      The addition of manure and straw increases the organic matter of the soil and provides an opportunity for seeds to establish. Monitoring will occur throughout the length of the project; there will be a final evaluation report.    Funding for this restoration effort comes from the BLM Director's Field Incentive Program. The Director's program funded critically-needed conservation projects during 1998. The combination of utilizing cows for soil improvement uniquely positioned this proposal to receive funding.      Noxious Weeds      Identified noxious weed sites will be treated. Additionally, the feedlots are designed to exclude those areas from the proposed treatment. This will limit the potential for additional spread of noxious weeds. The hay and straw used in the project has been inspected by BLM to assure that it is weed-free. Monitoring and inspection will occur throughout the course of the project.      Partners          A number of partners are involved with this unique reclamation project. Working     together we expect to reclaim this site and provide an opportunity for experience,     education, and an opportunity to work together on a public lands project.

Mining was terminated after only 2 months of development in the fall of 1983. Following the company's bankruptcy, mill buildings were auctioned at a Sheriff's sale. Reclamation, including reseeding, began in 1986. After 10 years, much of the area is still without adequate vegetation cover due to poor soil quality, limited precipitation, and locally extreme temperatures.

The narrative is concerned with land in 91 counties and six states. The larger parts of the project area are Idaho, eastern Washington, and eastern Oregon. Also included are portions of western Montana and Wyoming, and two counties in northern Nevada. By definition south-central and southeastern Oregon, though not within the Columbia River drainage, were included in the Eastside Ecosystem studies. This overview is focused on the region lying between the Cascades on the west and the Bitterroots and Rocky Mountains on the east. This is a largely rural area and has the least population density in the Pacific Northwest. Because the study area transcends state boundaries and excludes western Oregon and Washington, the writing of this narrative required use of diverse materials and working with census compilations in order to find patterns not skewed or shaped by figures or information from areas of greater population and economic activity west of the Cascades. The overview seeks to lift up several of the events in the past 200 years which have set a pattern or changed the course of this region's development. The goal of the overview is to grasp the larger picture and, where possible, illustrate it with examples. The narrative is thus a partial view of what has been the human experience. There are numerous topics not assessed such as education, politics, urbanization, and literary life. The bibliography, however, suggests specific studies which will illuminate in greater detail on the history raised or touched on this is report. The historical quarterlies of Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon--published for decades--contain a useful literature for even iv   more specific consideration. Similarly county ihistories and biographies or special studies such as those on the various districts of the Army Corps of Engineers, U. S. Forest Service cultural overviews, and other literature can prove highly useful in a more detailed study. To those who encouraged this project and had the patience to permit me to pursue this assignment--thank you.  Stephen Dow Beckham Pamplin Professor of History Lewis 8. Clark College  V   1. Native Americans For thousands of years native peoples have occupied the vast expanse of plateaus and canyons lying between the Cascades and the Bitterroots and Rockies. This region--the interior province of the Pacific Northwest--was the homeland of several different bands and trtbes at the end of the eighteenth century. Those peoples along the main Columbia and its primary tributaries, in spite of their different languages, shared many elements of a common lifeway. The term Columbia Plateau Culture is often used to differentiate them from their neighbors. In spite of cultural similarities, the peoples of the region also displayed influences and relationships from other areas. To the west the Indians who resided between Celilo Falls and Hood River confirmed by their plank houses, cedar dugout canoes, and heavy subsistence dependence on fish strong linkages to the Northwest Coast lifeway west of the Cascades. The natives of the Klamath Basin, Goose Lake region, Worner Valley, Harney Bosin, and large parts of southern ldoho possessed a seasonal round and linguistic relations which tied them to the Great Basin--another major cultural tradition of the American West. On the eastern Plateau the Nez Perce, Palous, Cayuse, Umatilla and their neighbors had acquired numerous elements of Plains culture, an influence which stemmed from their travel through the mountains to trade and to hunt buffalo. Thus, the Plateau Culture Area exhibited common features but also mirrored the dynamics of trade, exchange, intermarriage, and travel which bonded its people to their neighbors on all sides (Kroeber 1939:49-53, 55-59). Peoples of diverse languages lived across the Columbia Basin in the nineteenth century. The northern portion was largely Salishan country. These people included the Colville, Lakes, Nespelem, Okanagan. Sanpoil. Sinkaietk, Spokane, and Kailspel. The Sahaptin1   speakers held the main stem of the Columbia and its primary tributaries from near the mouth of the Okanagan south toward the Gorge. They  included the Sahaptin-speaking Kittitas, Klickitat, Meshal, Polouse, Tenino, Umatilla, Walula. Wanapam, Wayampam. and Yakimo as well as the Nez Perce. The Chinookans were the Wasco, Wishram, and Shahala of the Gorge. The Lututamian-speaking Klamath and Modoc resided in the Klamath Basin, while the Uto-Aztecan-speaking Northern Paiute extended far across central and southeastern Oregon. The Bannock and Shoshone resided across the extensive Snake Plain toward the Rockies in southern and eastern ldoho (Ray 1935:107-l 20: Spier 1936:721). These American Indians heavily focused upon a seasonal round which provided--with work--an abundant variety of foods. Critical to their lifeway was dependence on the fisheries of the Columbia River and its tributaries. The river was their great artery of food and commerce. It yielded salmon, steelhead, sturgeon, lampreys, suckers and trout. The fish came in such abundance that intensive fishing and processessing enabled those who lived at the primary falls and fisheries to secure food surpluses and wealth. Kettle Falls, Priest Rapids, Celilo Falls, Five Mile Rapids, and the Cascades were among the most important of the fisheries. Similarly Salmon Falls on the upper Snake and other rapids afforded important fisheries for the people of the Snake Plain. Annually thousands of Indians gathered at these sites to harvest the flood of fish which moved inexorably from the sea to spawn in the distont headwaters and hinterlands of the Pacific Northwest. The Indians observed the arrival of the salmon with a ""First Salmon"" rite and gave thanks that the life-renewing fish had returned to sustain them for another season. This respect and veneration of nature and her bounty extended through the seasonal round and dictated right behaviors for these people (Gunther 1962:610). Writing of the lowly 2   sucker, for example, Eugene Hunn observed Yakima attitudes: `The Indians' respect for these fish is exemplified by a special thanksgiving feast at Rock Creek longhouse, now held jointly with that for the first Indian celeries, and by a popular myth that recounts how Sucker-shattered by a fall from the sky--was revived and rehabilitated with bones contributed by many other animals so that people might catch them and enjoy them (Hunn 1990:155-158). The Indians of the Plateau employed several fishing techniques. At the falls and rapids they constructed.fishing platforms and used dipnets and fish clubs to catch the migrating salmon. They also fastened fish baskets to the rocks and, when the runs were intense, the leaping fish sometimes jumped directly into the baskets. The men wove traps for taking eels and, on smaller streams, drove stakes across the river to create a weir where they netted and clubbed the passing fish. Some people used gillnets. Manufactured of plant fibers, these nets had wooden floats and grooved sinkers to stretch them in the water. The migrating fish become entangled in the nets which the fishermen then hauled into their canoes or pulled onto the nearby beach (Spier and Sapir 1930:174-l 79). The nearly constant winds of the Plateau provided valuable assistance in food processessing. The Indians cleaned and filleted the fish and hung them by the hundreds in plank-covered sheds or mat shelters along the riverbank. The wind whipped through these ""curing stations,"" dehydrating the fishing. The Indians then packed the dried fish in large storage racks, raised on platforms out of reach of dogs and wild animals, and covered them with planks to keep out the moisture. They smoked eels and ate other fish soon after they caught them (Moulton 198691[5]:331). The Plateau Indian diet included numerous mammols. The Indians highly prized the deer. The men often pursued the deer in the early fall. 3   While the women and children were picking and sun-drying huckleberries and blackberries in the camps along the flanks of the major mountains looking out across the Plateau, the men were hunting with bow and arrow as well as snare. Their hunt sometimes continued past the first snowfall when, with dogs, they ran the deer through the drifts beneath the forest until they could shoot them (Spier and Sapir 1930:180-182). In the southern part of the Plateau the Indians hunted mule deer and antelope, an animal prized like the deer not only for its flesh but also for its hide, antlers, and bones--all of which yielded useful materials. Women contributed significantly to Plateau subsistence through their digging and processessing activities. The Plateau women had a thorough knowledge of edible roots and bulbs. Following rites to acknowledge their relationship to nature and appreciation for the bountiful crops, they went with their digging sticks and hemp root bags to harvest comas, bitter root, biscuit root (cous), wild celery, Canby's desert parsley, Indian carrot and--in the forests--the black lichen hanging in the conifers. These and other plant resources diversified their families' diets and provided important sources of minerals and vitamins (Hilty et al. 1972). Resource use followed a seasonal calendar. Much of the year--for perhaps as much as seven months--the people resided in permanent villages, most of them on old riverine terraces adjacent to the primary streams. They selected these sites for the convenience to fisheries, root areas, and the milder climates of lower elevation. During the months of the long moons when the winds and freezing weather held fast in their land, the elders shared oral tales and the tribes engaged in ritual feasts, dances, and renewal. In the spring and early summer the villages began to disperse, traveling to favored trade or quarry sites, visiting friends, or harvesting foods. Digging roots required considerable labor; 4   so did cutting and drying fish, picking berries, and collecting seeds. By late summer families had moved to the cooler high elevations to pick huckleberries and hunt deer. As winter closed in, they returned to their ages-old villages along the rivers (Haines 1991:155-163). The Plateau Indians possessed different types of shelters by the early nineteenth century. In some places the traditional and highly functional earth lodge, a largely subterranean structure constructed with poles laid in a circle and covered over with earth with a central entry hole and ladder, persisted for hundreds of years. This structure, when built at a site with good drainage, provided excellent protection from cold winter storms and snows. In the western part of the Plateau the Indians framed pole buildings and covered them with cebar planks much like the Indians of the western Gorge and beyond the Cascade Range to the west. .More common, however, was the mat-covered lodge. This structure could stand as a solitary tepee or it might be conjoined with several others to make a multi-family lodge with a series of fire hearths down its central axis (Haines 1991:9-10; Spier and Sapir 1930: 202-205). In the eastern part of the Plateau the tribes with Plains connections constructed buffalo-hide covered tepees. And in the area of the northern Great Basin the brush-surround and rock shelter protected the Northern Paiute, Shoshoni-Bannock, and others from the elements (Trenholm and Carley 1964). The Indians of the Columbia Basin possessed time-tested lifeways. They knew their land through thousands of yeors of residency. Their oral literature affirmed that genesis occurred nearby and that the world was ordered by right behaviors. The sweat lodge, prayers, ""first fruits"" ceremonies, and respect for the elders and tribal traditions--these maintained the orderly succession from generation to generation. And as summer followed winter, the turn of their world followed in almost endless progression. That orderly existence, however, confronted hints of   change in the eighteenth centu,y. The arrival of horses, a scatter of trade goods, and strange, deathly illnesses like smallpox were a portent of things to come. A well-ordered world stood on the edge of major disruption.  6   2. Exploration and Fur Trade The interior of the Pacific Northwest remained ""ten0 incognita"" for decades after European and American maritime explorers gave shape to the coastline in their charts and logs. In the mid-l 770s the Spanish, anxious to discover the extent of Russian penetration of the Northwest Coast from their stations in Alaska, dispatched explorers to examine the shore. Capt. James Cook of England, Comte de Laperouse of France, Alejandro Malaspina of Spain, and Capt. George Vancouver of England each directed subsequent voyages of discovery to the region. By 1820 an estimated 450 vessels had sailed the coastal waters: most of them carrying crews engaged in the lucrative fur trade with the region's native population (Cook 1973:Appendix E). In spite of these efforts, the compilation of detailed information about the shoreline ond its resources, and publication of reports by Cook and Vancouver in handsome, illustrated editions in 1784 and 1798, the interior of the region remained wholly on lndion lond. With the purchase of Louisiana Territory in 1803 from France, however, the United States was ready to examine the interior of North America. President Thomas Jefferson hod several times in the eighteenth century attempted to line up explorers--George Rogers Clark, John Ledyard, Dr. Moses Marshall, and Andre Michaux--to cross the continent. In 1803 as president he was in a position to translate that dream into reality. He turned to his secretary, Meriwether Lewis, and to William Clark, a former Army comrade of Lewis's, to lead a contingent via the Missouri River to the mouth of the Columbia ( Moulton 1986-91 [2]:1-2). Jefferson, a man of the Enlightenment and active member of the American Philosophical Society, gave Lewis a letter of detoiled instructions on the mission. The party was to explore a route for commerce in so for OS  possible by woter connections across the 7   American West. The men were to open diplomatic relations with the Indian tribes. They were to map the land, taking readings of longitude and latitude at principal stream confluences and points of remarkable geographical nature. They were to collect natural history specimens-both flora and fauna--and make copious notes on the seasons of blooming, production of seeds, and release of leaves of plants. They were to observe the weather, record temperatures of hot springs, note mineral appearances, and assess the potential of the soil. As would-be ethnographers they were to record information on native lifeways and to record Indian words against a prescribed list of terms (DeVoto 1958:481487). In all of these things the Lewis & Clark expedition secured success. Following an arduous portage of the Great Falls of the Missourf, the party entered the Pacific Northwest via Lemhi Pass. The men cut through a section of the Bitterroot Valley, ascended Lolo Creek, found the Lochsa drainage impassable, but followed the Indian route via the Lolo Trail until they emerged in the Clearwater country of central Idaho. At Canoe Camp near Orofino they constructed pirogues and journeyed by water down the Snake and Columbia rivers to spend the winter of 1805-06 at Fort Clatsop near the Pacific Ocean. The Lewis and Clark journals included an almost encyclopedic sei of observations about the route they travelled. They described Indians villages, dress, and, in so far as they could communicate, elements of the lifeways. William Clark on September 5, 1805, described his first encounter with the.""Cho pun-&h or Pierced Noses"" [the Nez Perce]: They are darker than the   Tushapaws   Their dress Similar, with more beads white 8 blue principally, brass 7 Copper in different forms, Sheels and ware their haire in the Same way. they are large Portley men Small women 8, handsome fetued [featured] (Moulton 1986-91[5]:222). 8   The party observed the vast quantities of salmon harvested and winddried by the tribes at Celilo Falls and Five Mile Rapids. William Clark noted on October 22, 1805: "". passed at the uper end of the portage 17 lodges of Indians, great numbers of baskets of Pounded fish on the rocks Islands & near their Lodges thos are neetly pounded & put in verry new baskets of about 90 or 100 pounds wight"" (Moulton 198691 [5]:320). On their return from the coast in April, 1806, Meriwether Lewis observed the ""first salmon"" ceremony at The Dalles: there was great joy with the natives last night in consequence of the arrival of the salmon: one of those fish was caught; this was the harbinger of good news to them. they informed us that these fish would arrive in great quantities in the course of about 5 days. this fish was dressed and being divided into small pieces was given to each child in the village. this custom is founded in a superstitious opinon that it. will hasten the arrival of the salmon [Moulton 198691 [7]:142). The explorations of Lewis and Clark proved of singular significance to the interior of the Pacific Northwest. The explorers returned to St. Louis in 1806 to a nation eager to learn of their discoveries. Fur seekers soon pressed up the Missouri to engage in two decades of prosperous trade in the Rockies. Readers turned to the journals of Patrick Goss and Joseph Whitehouse and, with the publication of the Lewis and Clork diaries in two volumes in 1814, secured an even more detailed account of the lands and resources they had explored. The expedition also extended the claims of the United States to sovereignty in the Pacific Northwest. The expedition was the first of Euroamericans to penetrate the region and it was a military outfit financed largely by the government of the United States. The labors of this exploring party paid off handsomely when the United States faced down Great Britain in the negotiations in 1846 over the Oregon Treaty. The Lewis 8 Clark 9   expedition was a trump card played by the United States in the game of national dominion. The scientific achievements produced an even more impressive tally. Lewis and Clark's observations created an initial base of ethnographic data on dozens of Indian bands and tribes. They mapped the route they traveled and discovered that the Columbia was a ""mighty continental river with a vast interior drainage."" The explorers made numerous discoveries of fauna and noted their behavior and habits. They also brought back more than 200 herbarium specimens and discovered over 170 plants not previously known to science from their travels in the Columbia watershed. Paul Cutrtght assessed their numerous contributions and concluded: `The journey stands, incomparably, as the transcendent~ achievement of its kind in this hemisphere, if not in the entire world. Whereas Louisiana Territory had been `an area of rumor, guess, and fontasy, now that Lewis and Clark hod revealed it, it was a focus of reality (Cutright 1969:393-397). Fur trappers and traders moved steadily westward, depleting the fur-bearing animals of successive frontiers to create ecological disruption and momentous impacts on notive populations. That process moved to the region west of the Rockies in the first decade of the nineteenth century. British explorers Simon Fraser and David Thompson followed the footsteps and canoe routes of Alexander Mackenzie, the first man to have crossed North American by land in 1792, and extended the landbased fur trade to the upper Columbia watershed of British Columbia. Between 1807 and 1811 the British fur seekers established a series of depots and trading sites in northern Idaho, western Montana, northeastern Washington, and eastern British Columbia. David Thompson of the North West Company crossed the Rockies via Athabaska Pass and descended the Columbia to build a fort in 1811 on the Spokane River. In July, Thompson canoed on down the Columbia to its mouth only to 10   discover that Americans working for John Jacob Astor had already established a fur trade post on the south shore of the river (Skinner 1920:133-135). Astor was a visionary. A German-born immigront, he prospered in the fur trade as a wholesaler. Hearing of the reports of Lewis 8. Clark, Astor formed the Pacific Fur Company and in 1810 dispatched employees by land and by sea to establish Fort Astor on the northwest Oregon coast to open direct trade with China. Astor's overland party under Wilson Price Hunt departed from St. Louis in September, 1810, to commence an orduous continental trek. They crossed the Rockies at Union Pass to the Green River and pressed on to the upper reaches of the Snake where, with newly-made canoes, they set out by water for the Pacific. In ten doys they covered some 360 miles only to find Shoshone and Twin Falls and the necessity of abandoning their river descent. In December, 1811, the party passed through northeastern Oregon, pressed on across the Columbio Plateau, and in February, 1812 arrived at Fort Astoria at the river's mouth (Skinner 1920:181-183). For a time the Pacific Fur Company and the North West Company competed for the harvest of beaver, marten, fox, and other mammal pelts in the Columbia watershed. David Stuart, an Astor employee, established Fort ,Okanogan in 1811 at the confluence of the Okanogan with the Columbia. In 1813 Astor's partners-in-the-field at Fort Astoria sold out the interests of the Pacific Fur Company in fear that the British Navy would cross into the Columbia and seize their station as a prize of the War of 1812-14 then raging between the United States and Great Britain. In 1818 the North West Company constructed Fort Nez Perces, subsequently Fort Walla Walla, a post a few miles below the junction of the Snake and Columbia rivers and located at the mouth of the Walla Walla. In 1821 the British parliament forcibly merged the North West Company into its rtval;the Hudson's Bay Company. For the next twenty11   five years that firr,) dominated the fur trade in the Pacific Northwest. Table 1. Fur Trade Posts, Columbia Basin, 1810-1836 Fur Trade Post Kootenay House Flathead House Ft. Okanogan Ft. Nez Perces Ft. Colvile Ft. Hall Ft. Boise (Stern 1993:6-7) Subsequent to 1821 the fur trade in the interior of the Pacific Northwest was almost exclusively the monopoly of the Hudson's Bay Company. The firm operated from its headquarters at Fort Vancouver on the Columbia estuary near the mouth of the Willamette River. It dispatched heovily laden bateaux with trade goods to its posts in the interior. These, in turn, sent down the river the harvest of furs, many of .them purchased from loco1 Indians. The Company also operated an extensive brigade system (Rich 1959:448, 570578). In five expeditions during the 1820s Peter Skene Ogden carried out the assignment to exploit the furs of the Snake River as well as the Great Basin to the south. Ogden's far flung travels took him through eostern and south-central Oregon as well as into northern California. The company's strategy was to trap the fur-bearing animals of the Snoke to extinction so that if Americans crossed the Rockies they would become so frustrated at the lack of return for their travels and labors thot they would turn back. In this Ogden and his employers lorgely succeeded (Cline 1974:69). The matrix of trode in the Columbia Basin depended heavily upon 12 Company North West Co. North West Co. Pacific Fur Co. North West Co. Hudson's Bay Co. Nathaniel Wyeth Hudson's Bay Co. Date Established 1810 1810 1811 1818 1834 1835   the participation of the Indian population. The company found an olready extensive and thriving network of exchange which extended for centuries into the prehistoric past. The shipment of dried salmon, obsidian, and bear grass down the Columbia and other prized items brought in exchange decorative shells, wappato roots, whale oil, smelt and other coastal commodities. The fur traders introduced glass beads, woolen blankets, metal tools, firearms, cotton cloth, and other items which became new commodities in the economic system. Their goal was to acquire furs. Sometimes they purchased these directly from Native Americans who come to their posts. Other times, they secured foodstuffs, horses, and laborers from the Plateau Indian communities to outfit the brigades which might into the field for several months to trap and trade for furs (Stern 1993:19-28). The Hudson's Bay Company in the 1830s inaugurated a program of post self-sufficiency. In so far as possible each post was to engage in agricultural pursuits--farming ond stockraising--to sustain its employees and to assist brigades outfitting for work in the surrounding countryside. East of the Cascades these ventures resulted in the initial introduction of agriculture. Fort Nez Perces at the mouth of the Wolla Wall0 was representative of these enterprises. In 1835 the post hod twelve head of cattle, seventy-five horses, and six pigs: in 1846 the livestock included thirty-six cattle, 115 horses, and thirty-eight pigs. By the early 1840s Pierre Pambrun, the trader, tilled 50 acres olong the Walla Walla River: in 1845 he had twelve acres in vegetables and in 1846 opened another thirty acres some twenty miles from the fort (Gibson 1985:52-54). Fort Okanogan, an important station for monitoring and supporting the riverine transportation system of the .Hudson's Bay Company, stood at the head of bateau navigation on the Columbia. In 1845 it had seven cultivated acres and was noted for its production of fine potatoes. Fort Boise had two tilled acres, twenty-seven cattle, and seventeen horses in 13   1846. Fort Hall, founded by Nothoniel Wyeth in 1834, possed to the Hudson's Boy Company which began agriculture in 1836. By 1845 Fort Holl had five tilled acres, 95 cattle ond 171 horses. `These efforts ond those at Fort Boise,"" concluded James Gibson, ""enabled the two posts not only to feed their own personnel but also to succour American migrants on the Oregon Trail in the first half of the 1840's"" [Gibson 1985:58-59). American entrepreneurs attempted to break into the monopoly of the North West Company and Hudson's Bay Company but with little success. In 1828 Jedediah Smith entered western Oregon by traveling along the margins of the Pacific Ocean from northwestern California. His party suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Lower Umpqua indions. Smith lost eleven of his men ond sold what was salvaged of his furs to the Hudson's Boy Company (Sullivan 1934:112-135). In 1832 Nathaniel Wyeth of Boston established Fort William on Sauvie Island at the mouth of the Willamette River and in 1834 established Fort Hall on the upper Snake. In spite of his investments, energy, ond tenacity, Wyeth was unable to prosper. He explored the Deschutes River and traded with Indians but sold out in 1835 to the Hudson's Bay Company (Wyeth 1899). An unexpected byproduct of the fur trode in the interior of the Pacific Northwest was the opportunity for collectors of notural history specimens to travel to remote regions with the brigades and the opportunity to secure supplies and support from the Hudson's Bay Company posts. David Douglas, the Scottish botanist, arrived in the Pacific Northwest in 1825 under the auspices of the Royal Horticultural Society of London. Between March and August, 1826, Douglas traveled in the Columbia Basin, ascending the river to Kettle Falls. Douglas collected specimens in the upper Columbia and then located at Fort Nez Perces. In June he explored the Blue Mountains; in July he went to 14   the Clearwater River. In August ho crossed overland to the Spokane and then descended the Columbia some 800 miles to Fort Vancouver. His far-reaching travels yielded a number of specimens, though in an accident in crossing a river in August Douglas lost his seed collection and some of his notebooks (McKelvey 1991:299-318). Douglas returned from England in 1830 ond again traveled to Fort Nez Perces on the Walla Walla River and carried out further work along the main stem of the Columbia in 1833. A solitary man of vigorous fortitude and dedication to collecting plants and observations of nature, Douglas revealed a bit of his character in a letter in March, 1833: To console myself for the wont of friends of a kindred feeling in this distant land, for an exchange of sympathy or advice, I vary my amusements: by day it is a barren place that does not afford me a blade of grass . . . during the stillness of a cloudless night . . localities are determined, altitudes measured, the climate. . . analyzed. Thank God my heart feels gladness in these operations . . (McKelvey 1991:424). Other naturalists worked in the Columbia Basin in the 1830s as well. They included Nathaniel J. Wyeth who collected specimens in 1832 for his friend Thomos Nuttall of Harvard University. In 1834 Nuttall and John Kirk Townsend accompanied Wyeth on his overland journey. Townsend, an able shot and powerful writer, completed his journey with so many mammal and bird specimens that he sold his duplicates to John J. Audubon. Subsequently Audubon used these for illustrations in his Quadrupeds of North America and Birds of North America. Townsend's narrative--an unfolding natural history of his route across what was to become the Oregon Trail--appeared as Narrafive of a Journey Across the Rocky Mountains to fhe Columbia River. The volume included appendices listing the scientific observations (Townsend 1839). In 1837 John McLeod of the Hudson's Bay Company collected botanical 15   specimens in the Snake watershed for Dr. William F. Tolmie (McKelvey 1991:389). Notice of these plants appeared in The Botany of Capfain Beechey's Voyage (Hooker and Walker-Arnott 1841). In the 1840s several other noturalists explored and reported on the flora and fauna of the Columbia Basin. In 1841 a detachment of the U.S. South Seas Surveying and Exploring Expedition ascended the Columbia River to the mouth of the Walla Walla. The explorations produced a detailed map of the route as well as botanical work of William Dunlop Brackenridge who traveled from Fort Nisqually to Fort Colvile. In June and July, Brackenridge explored the Columbia Plateau south to the Spalding Mission at Lapwai, Idaho, on the Clearwater, then to Fort Nez Perces. His party returned to Puget Sound via Naches Pass. The explorations involved a trip of nearly 1,000 miles and resulted in an extensive botanical collection (Brackenridge 1930-31). In 1843 Karl Andreos Geyer, a German botanist, came to the Pacific Northwest to collect specimens for William Jackson Hooker. Geyer traveled west via South Pass to Fort Hall. He turned north to western Montana and to Fort Colvile and Lake Coeur D'Alene. He then traveled southeastward to the junction of the Clearwater and Snake rivers, to Fort Walla Walla. and finally in 1844 to Fort Vancouver. Geyer's collections ron to nearly 10,000 specimens as well OS  seeds of about 350  species. By the mid-twentieth century thirteen different American plants were named in his honor (McKelvey 1991:773-788). Also in 1843 John C. Fremont brought his crew of Topographical Engineers west via the Oregon Trail to The Dalles. Fremont then turned his party south along the eastern flank of the Cascades to enter the Great Basin. These explorations--an extension of Fremont's reconnaissance to South Pass in 1842--received considerable attention with the publication of his travel diaries, route mops, and illustrative plates by the Government Printing Office (Fremont 1845). 16   Joseph Burke, a botanical collector who worked in South Africa between 1839 and 1842, entered the Pacific Northwest by descending the Columbia River from Canada. He located at Fort Hall in eastern Idaho and worked from there between November, 1844, and August, 1846. Burke's far-flung travels included a transit of the Applegate Trail in 1846 when he joined the first emigrant train to turn over that route at Fort Hall. In spite of his energetic labors and travels, Burke's botanical contributions were scanty. The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew had no list of his specimens. His seeds produced a solitary juniper which grew to a height of five feet in 1884 (McKelvey 1991:794-817). In 1853 the U.S. Army launched a fairly comprehensive examination of the Pacific Northwest as part of the Pacific Railroad Surveys. Funded by Congress to find five alternate routes for a transcontinental railroad, the surveys also included the exomination of potential north-south connectors on either flank of the Cascade Range. Isaac lngalls Stevens, a West Point graduate, directed the surveys between the 47th and the 49th parallels--a tract extending from the Great Lakes west to Puget Sound. As Stevens' party moved westward another, directed by Lt. George 6. McClellan, examined potential passes over the Cascades in Washington Territory. In Oregon, a detachment head by Lt. George Abbot and Lt. Robert Stockton Williamson mounted a comparable survey. Attached to each of the western crews were artists and naturalists. These included John Strong Newberry, James Graham Cooper, Dr. George Suckley, and George Gibbs. Their observations covered the flora, fauna, paleontology, ond ethnology of the region. The detailed scientific ond engineering reports--including data on rainfoll and temperatures as well as dozens of hand-colored plates illustrating the geography and remarkable specimens--filled two volumes of the dozen in the Pacific Railroad Reporfs (Goetzmann 1966:285-286, 290-29 1). 17   From the travels of the Lewis 8 Clork expedition in 1805-06 to the descriptive, scientific studies of the Pacific Railroad surveyors the Euroamerican understanding of the Columbia Basin grew dramatically. The fur traders explored the land; introduced major changes into the cultures of the Native Americans, and, in a number of instances set the course of highly consequential ecological changes. The programs of economic self-sufficiency at the fur troding posts tested the potentials for agriculture and proved that the interior held remarkable promise for farming and stockraising. Natural historions--both botanists and zoologists--examined the region's flora and fauna. Their collections steadily made their way into the scientific literature of the nineteenth century and began to give shape to the understanding of biotic provinces and patterns of species distribution. By the mid-1800s the Columbia Basin was a reasonably known region, a place dominated by the ages-old native cultures but a setting latent with prospects of change.  18   3. Missions While the fur trade and explorotion contributed significantly between 1811 and 1846 to changes in the clothing, technology, and trade of Indians of the Columbia watershed, the advent of Christian missions proved ultimotely of greater consequence. The impacts were not so much in changing the native religious practices but in the larger forces unleashed by missionaries in the region. Missionaries were harbingers of Euroamerican settlement ond lifeways. Unlike the transient and singularly-focused trappers, traders, and explorers, they had more consequential objectives. In the decade of the 1830s three different mission programs reached out to the Indians of the interior of the Pacific Northwest. These efforts were the result of more than 30 years of intense religious activity in the eastern United States. That movement, often referred to as the Second Great Awakening, fostered personal piety, a sense of evangelical responsibility, and sectarian competition in `winning"" souls to the Christian faith. The development of both home and foreign mission societies by several denominations in the 1810s and the founding of the American Bible Society in 1816 set the stoge for expanding Christian teachings. These organizations also confirmed the mission field was competitive and that unique persuasions and interpretations of the religious experience might penetrate distant lands. Rev. Jason Lee in 1834 led a contingent of four Amerlcan men across the Oregon Trail in company with the fur seeker Nathaniel Wyeth of Boston. Lee's Methodist party came to establish a chain of protestant stations among the natives. Although Lee originally planned to work on the Columbia Plateau, he accepted the advice of Dr. John McLaughlin of the Hudson's Bay Company and established his initial mission at the southern margin of French Proirie in the Willamette Valley (Brosnan  19   1932:70-83; Hulbert and Hulbert 1935:134-184). With additional capital and reinforcements in 1838, however, Lee exponded his field. Among the new stations wos a site o few miles west of the great Indian fishery at Five Mile Rapids and Celilo Falls. Lee's nephew, Daniel Lee, and Henry W. Perkins, established at The Dalles the Wascopam Mission. For the next nine years a succession of Methodist ministers and lay people labored to sustain themselves through agriculture and to preach to the none-toointerested local natives. The missionaries introduced cattle to the area in September, 1838, ond the following year planted their first garden (Brosnan 1932:166-l 68). `This place is nearly one hundred miles from civilization,"" noted George Gary in 1844, ""and here [reside] but two families, the preacher and farmer. The supplies of the farm must be hod for the support of the preacher and the minister wants the aid and society of the farmer . . . Gary 1923: 168). In 1835 Rev.. Samuel Parker and Dr. Marcus Whitman made a reconnaissance westward along the Oregon Trail to examine the prospects for missions for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) in the Oregon Country. Whitman turned bock to recruit personnel: Parker continued on to western Oregon and wrote a widely read travel narrative, Journal of on Exploring Tour Beyond the Rocky Mounfoins (1838). Porker's book provided a detailed discussion of the land, resources, and Native Americans. He ascended the Columbia in the spring of 1836 to explore the lower Snake, Clearwater, and Spokane watersheds before descending the Columbia to the seo. While at Fort Colville, near Kettle Foils, Parker noted: `The winter and summer grains, together with garden vegetables, are cultivated with success and in profusion."" He included o ""Meteorological Table"" from October 4, 1835, to May 15, 1836, with specific dota on temperotures throughout the day and weather ot sunrise and sunset. He provided three Indian vocabulorfes, maps, and notes on his return seo voyage vio Hawaii: 20   Parkers book was one of several travel narratives written in the 1830s which gave precise information about the prospects of Oregon Territory (Parker 1838). Whitman returned westward in 1836. He brought his wife, Narcissa, and fellow workers Henry and Eliza Spalding. The transit of these two women across the Oregon Trail proved that the vast wilderness beyond the Mississippi might be subject to emigration by families, a consideration eagerly seized upon by residents along the American frontier (Drury 196366[1]:31-33;[3]:307-318). The Whitmans settled at Waiilatpu on the Walla Walla River nearly 25 miles upstream from its confluence with the Columbia. The Spaldings chose a site at Lapwai on the Clearwater River near the base of the Bitterroot Mountains in north-central Idaho. Within a few years the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, an ecumenical mission agency supported by the Presbyterian, Dutch Reformed, and Congregational denominations, established additional missions at Tshimakain near Spokane and Kamiah, among the Nez Perce farther up the Clear-water River in Idaho (Drury 1937:203). The ABCFM missions become a point of determined efforts for cultural change. These missionaries embraced the idea that ""civilization"" was a precursor to conversion to Christianity. They defined ""civilization"" narrowly. The Indians were to become sedentary, English-speaking agrarians who wore Euroamerican clothing, respected privacy, owned private property, and observed the sanctity of the sabbath. Eliza Hart Spalding's diary of November 29, 1836, penned at Lapwoi, Idaho, on her arrival at the mission site, reflected the point of view: we would humbly hope, about to enter upon the glorious, blessed, but responsible work of loboring to introduce the blessings of that Gospel which brings life 8. immortality to light, among this benighted people, who have long felt that they were sitting in darkness & perishing for lack of knowledge. May we have 21   heavenly wisdom B grace, to labor successfully for the promotion of our Master's cause in this dark portion of His vineyard (Drury 1963-66[1]:197-198). Thus these missionaries sought to demonstrate the viability of a settled, agricultural lifeway and the benefits of Christian religious commitment. The program meant that each mission--in the lands of the Spokane, Cayuse, and Nez Perce--was a testing place for an agrarian economy which included production of cereal crops, vegetables, livestock, and fruit (Drury 1963-66[1]:141, 200, 212; [2]:1 16). In the 1830s Catholic clerics in Quebec laid plans to reach out to a population of over 500 French-Canadians who were, at least, nominally Catholic and working in the Columbia watershed for the Hudson's Bay Company. Of particular concern was the growing population of children born to these men and native women. Few had participated in the rites of marriage or baptism. The opportunities beckoned and thus the Bishop of Quebec dispatched Francis Norbert Blanchet and Modeste Demers to journey overland in 1838 with a supply brigade to the fur posts and establish missions in the watershed of the Columbia River. The priests founded initial stations in western Oregon and Washington. TWO years later the Jesuits dispatched Pierre Jean De Smet to examine prospects for missions on the western flanks of the Rockies. Following his explorations, De Smet returned in 1841 with Gregory Mengarini and Nicholas Point and three laymen `brothers"" to establish the Mission of the Sacred Heart among the Coeur d'Alenes, St. Mary's Mission in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana among the Flathead Indians, and St. lgnatius in 1844 among the Spokanes. In time the Jesuits also founded the missions of St. Paul at Kettle Falls and St. Mary's at Omak (O'Hara 1925; Point 1967~6-7; Raufer 1966136-59). Several Oblate priests came to the Columbia Plateau in 1847 with 22   Father A. M. A. Blanchet to establish missions among the Yokima, Cayuse, Umatilla, and Nez Perce. One, Father Jean Baptiste Abraham Brouillet, founded the Mission of St. Ann among the Umatilla Indians. His mission was in direct competition to the Whitmans who were murdered along with nine others at their station two days subsequent to Brouillet's arrival. Learning of this disaster, Brouillet hurrted to their station and buried the bodies of those who perished on that fatal November morning. Twice burned during the subsequent Indian wars, Brouillet's mission nevertheless survived. The priests also established missions at Frenchtown on the Walla Walla River and St. Rose of the Cayouse and St. Rose of Lima. These stations were to serve the Coyuse, Llmatilla, and Nez Perce (Munnick and Munnick 1989:v-xii). Thus in a little over fifteen years three, competing mission programs entered the lives of Indians of the Columbia Basin. While each differed in its theology and method, all represented the imposition of new ideas and lifeways. Especially significant were the protestant efforts of the Methodist and American Board personnel. They approached conversion with a twofold program. First, they envisioned acculturation--the shift of Native Americans from a nomadic fishing and hunting culture to a sedentary, agricultural life style. Second, they envisioned, OS  a  consequence of having attained o ""civilized"" state, the embrace of their particular interpretations of Christianity. The consequences of this program were several (Thompson 1969). The missionaries--in part to sustain t.hemselves and also to demonstrate the value of o changed lifeway--embarked on ambitious and largely successful agricultural programs. They introduced farming, especially production of cereal crops ond fruit, as well as livestock husbandry. While the fur companies had made nominal efforts in these areas at Fort Walla Wallo, Fort Colville, 0nd.For-t Boise, the missionaries confirmed clearly the agricultural potentials of the interior region of the 23   Pacific Northwest. They increased their acreages, harvested grains, hay, and fruit, and multiplied the numbers of their livestock. Their success they broadcast in letters home, in correspondence with eastern newspapers, and in preaching missions to the East to raise money to sustain and expand their missions. In May, 1841, Rev. Elkanah Walker who resided in the Spokane watershed wrote: ""Took up the team & harrowed the ground & planted my potatoes."" A few days later on June 7 he noted: ""Finished ploughing 8. sewing wheat & corn"" (Drury 1976:148-l 49). The missionaries served as exceedingly important vehicles to test and subsequently to publicize the agricultural potentials of the Columbia watershed. The Catholics tallied hundreds and ultimately several thousand entries in their mission and parish registers. Patient, sworn to poverty, preaching with interesting elements of ceremony--candles, incense, icons, and Latin prayers, possessing ties to the fur trapper community through the nominally Catholic French-Canadians, and skilled as linguists, the priests largely accomplished their goals. In time, with schools staffed by female teaching orders, they left on enduring imprint on the religious persuasion of Columbia Plateau Indians. This tally is confirmed in Catholic Church Records of the Pacific Northwest, 7 vols., 1971-89. In terms of conversions the protestant missions fared poorly. The Indians expressed little interest in abandoning their traditional ways, especially their spirit powers or the roles of shamans. When matters of monogamy arose, the Indians argued justifiably that their practice of plural marriages to take care of widows and other observances were essential for the welfare of their people. The cultural gulf between the missionaries and their intended targets were significant and, ultimately, highly consequential. While the missionaries envisioned an imminent ""second coming"" and judgment, so too did the Native Americans. The prophetic traditions of the eighteenth century surfaced again in the 24   latter nineteenth century with the teachings of Smohollah and Skoloskin. The stage was set for conflicting religious visions of the future and, even more fundamentally, almost wholly divergent attitudes toward the land and the place of humans in it. Missions did not resolve these differences: they exacerbated them [Miller 198589-l 16: Ruby and Brown 1989). In 1855 the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints based in Salt Lake City, Utah, established Fort Limhi on the Salmon River in Idaho. Twenty-seven missionaries came to this field but, as troubles mounted between the Mormons and the United States Army in Utah, the church felt compelled to withdraw. The Mormons abandoned this mission in 1858 (Nash 1967:22-31). The protestant missionaries had proven that women could cross the continent, that children could survive on this distant frontier, and that the region had undreamed of potentials for expanded American settlement. The Catholic missionaries demonstrated that patience and accommodation as well OS  linguistic skill and a solid base of support  could, in time, lead to permanent parishes in the interior of the Pacific Northwest. In these regards the missions to the Indians of the Columbia Plateau--especially the efforts of the Americans--bulked large in the unfolding epic of overland migration of the mid-nineteenth century.  25   4. Overland Emigration In the decade of the 1840s restlessness seized a generation of Americans. Hundreds, then thousands decided to leave their homes and seek new beginnings on the distant Pacific Slope. Complex forces of history and personal motivations drove this epic migration. Some factors of national scope shaped the rapid expansion of American settlement westward: others linked to special events such OS  the  discovery in 1848 of gold in California. The mid years of the nineteenth century were when Americans charted a new direction for the Pacific Northwest. Overland emigration became the fulcrum upon which turned an entirely new human impact upon the land and resources of the empire of the Columbia. The words ""manifest destiny,"" coined by journalist John L. O'Sullivan in 1845, captured part of what was underway on the eve of massive migration westward. O'Sullivan wrote that Americans sensed that there appeared o purpose for their country to expand from sea to sea (Merk 1963:24-60). No nation, argued O'Sullivan, had the right to thwart American policy, power, or limit ""the fulfillment of our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions . (O'Sullivan 1845:5-10). The idea of o continental destiny had received ardent nurturing in the public arena for more than two decades. In the forefront was Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri and his promotion of the settlement of. the West. He thundered forth in speeches about a ""passage to India,"" a ""channel of Asiatic commerce,"" and the inexorable course toward a continental nation (Smith 197522-34). He helped finance at public expense the explorations of the Oregon Trail in 1842 and 1843 led by his son-in-law, Lt. John C. Fremont, and with Sen. Lewis Linn of Missouri, introduced a series of bills offering free land to those who 26   would settle in Oregon. Benton's daughter, Jessie, skillfully rewrote her husband's diaries into narratives of adventure ond celebration of the resources of the distant West (Herr 1987:103-l 13). When coupled with the detailed maps of Charles Preuss--including a special, seven-section map of the Oregon Trail based on the reconnaissance of 1843--on American public responded with enthusiasm. The Fremont narratives and accompanying maps were printed by the Government Printing Office and thus widely available (Fremont 1845). Technology also played a part in American thinking in the 1840s. The rapid proliferation of steamboats, railroads, and canal systems confirmed that lands and resources once distant could be drawn into the nation's economy. Further, people moving to the frontier could anticipate that with appropriate investment and energy they, too, could become linked to established communities and trade. Asa Whitney, a New York merchant who made a fortune in the Orient, proposed to Congress in 1845 o land grant sixty miles wide across the continent as a subsidy to investors who would build a transcontinental railroad. Whitney's dreams and ardent promotions found fertile soil and, by 1848, led to the conversion of Senator Benton, among others, to endorse o Pacific railroad to be constructed by the federal government (Smith 1975:30-31). Samuel F. B. Morse's invention of the telegraph and its use by 1844 in sending messages over vast distances further engaged the imagination. O'Sullivan extolled the potentials of the ""magnetic telegraph"" and envisioned a communications system linking Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia and San Francisco with the Eastern Seaboard (O'Sullivan 1845: 10). Political factors played a part, too. Andrew Jackson, president from 1828 to 1836, was both an ardent nationalist and an expansionist. He dispatched Lt. William Slacum in 1836 to examine harbors from San Diego to Puget Sound as well as to assess the condition of the 27   Willamette Valley. Jackson's administration also supported the major outlay of public funds to underwrite the U. S. South Seas Surveying and Exploring Expedition under Lt. Charles Wilkes. The five vessels and crew of scientists in this naval party came to the Pacific Northwest in 1841. Exploring parties ascended and mapped the Columbia as far east as Fort Wollo Walla. Botanists, geologists, artists, a linguist, and cartographers secured detailed information about the region's resources. The scientists and naval officers released this data in five volumes and an atlas in 1845, a volume on ethnology and philology in 1847, and subsequent folios containing hand-colored illustrations of the flora and fauna encountered during the explorations (Hale 1847; Wilkes 1845). Many were aware of Jackson's interest in Texas and heralded the annexation of the Lone Star Republic in 1845 wishes of the late President Jackson. The political campaign and election of James Knox Polk as president in 1844 proved of paramount importance in shaping political interest in the Oregon Country. Polk had a simple agenda: creation of a continental nation. He outrageously called for the ""reannexation of Oregon,"" sought the presidency under the slogan ""fifty-four forty or fight"" (suggesting that the boundary of southeast Alaska was the actual reach of American claims), and brazenly carried out his agendas when elected. Polk brought Great Britain to the Oregon Treaty (1846) by giving that nation notice that the United States intended to terminate the agreement of `joint occupancy"" in the Pacific Northwest. Beset with internal problems and war-weary, the British conceded the extension of the 49th parallel to the Pacific Ocean as the new boundary west of the Rockies. Polk also declared that Mexican soldiers had ""invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil,"" a dubious contention of American ownership of lands south of the Nueces River in Texas (Richardson 1896[5]:2287-2293). Congress responded with 28 OS  carrying out the dying   a declaration of war and the United States invaded Mexico, seized oneI third of her lands, and forced through the Treaty of Guadelupe Hidalgo (1848) to acquire California, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Colorado, .Utah, and Nevada. His goals accomplished, Polk stepped down and did not seek a second term. Tens of thousands of Americans residing on the frontier of the Mississippi and Missouri valleys had special reasons for considering movement to Oregon. The Panic of 1837 brought an economic downturn which beset the region for a decade. Many who lived there were first land speculators and second, farmers. Unable to sell out their improvements and get a new start, they responded eagerly to the bills of Senator Lewis Linn to provide for ""donation"" lands to those who emigrated to Oregon. Should such laws pass, they could afford to take but a modest return for their farms and buildings and begin, anew, in the Willomette Valley. There they might plot towns, run for political office, or find unexpected fame or fortune (Johansen and Gates 1957:232-233, 236-237). Flooding and health were also factors. The late 1830s brought repeated flooding to the bottomlands along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Farmers waited for weeks for the waters to subside, only to find their fields covered with sand and the summer beset with malarial fevers spawned by the infestations of mosquitoes. Cursing the ague or ""tet-tian fever,"" many read with interest about distant Oregon where neither floods nor pestilence seemed to occur or take a toll (Bowen 1978:18-l 9). Americans possessed a variety of sources providing accurate information about the Oregon Territory. These included John Wyeth's Oregon, Or a Short Hisfory of a Long Journey from Aflanfic fo the Region of the Pacific, by Land (1833). Washington Irving's Asforia (1836) and The Adventures of Captain Bonneville (1837), Samuel Parkers Journal of Travels Beyond fhe Rocky Mounfains (1838). John Kirk Townsend's   Narrative of a Journey Across the Rocky Mounfains fo the Columbia River (1839), and the Memoir, Historical and Political, of fhe Norfhwesf Coast of Norfh America (1840) compiled by Robert Greenhow and published at the request of Sen. Lewis Linn by the federal government. Thomas J. Farnham's Travels in the Greaf Western Prairies, the Anahuac and Rocky Mountains, and in the Oregon Tenifory (1843) recounted his adventures of explorations in 1839. Additionally, the Journals of Lewis and Clark, published in two volumes in 1814, the report of William Slacum about his reconnaissance of the Willamette Valley in 1837, published in 1838, and the explorations of the U.S. South Seas Surveying and Exploring Expedition in Oregon Territory in 1841--published with maps, charts, plates, and natural history materials in 1845-provided sound, scientific observations about the land and its resources. These books and reports gave good press to the region. In fact, they celebrated its climate, soil, timber, fish, furs, and prospects in glowing detail. In addition to scientific reports and travel narratives, guidebooks promoted the Pacific Northwest and provided useful information on the necessary supplies, teams, camping gear, tables of distances, river crossings, and even handy phrases or word lists for opening communication with Native Americans. The guidebooks included P. L. Edwards' Sketch of fhe Oregon Terrifory, Or, Emigrant's Guide (1842), Lansford W. Hastings, The Emigrants' Guide, fo Oregon and California (1845), John M. Shively's Route and Distances fo Oregon and California (1846), Overton Johnson and William Winters Roufe Across the Rocky Mountains (1846). joel Palmers Journal of Travels over fhe Rocky Mountains fo the Moufh of the Columbia River (1847), and J. Quinn Thornton's Oregon and California in 1848 (1849). Each of these authors had journeyed overland to Oregon. They founded their observations and advice on personal experience and gave good press to the Pacific Slope and the Oregon Country in particular (Beckham 1992:8-l 3). 30   Palmer's guidebook included his travel diary, detailed observations of Oregon, and special sections-- ""Necessary Outfits for Emigrants Traveling to Oregon,"" a `Table of Distances,"" and Indian word lists. To this he appended a letter of Rev. Henry H. Spalding summarizing in 1846 his decade of residency on the Clearwater River in Idaho. Spalding wrote prophetically about the Columbia Plateau: I once thought the valleys only susceptible of habitation: considering the plains too dry for cultivation. But I am now prepared to say this is not the case. . . . My place is one of the deepest valleys, and consequently the most exposed to the reflection from the high bluffs around, which rise from two to three thousand feet: but my farm, though prepared for irrigation, has `remained without it for the last four years. I find the ground becomes more moist by cultivation. Three years ago I raised six hundred bushels of shelled corn from six acres, and good crops of wheat on the same piece the following years, without irrigation. Eight years ago I raised 1500 bushels of potatoes from one acre and a half. ""Every kind of grain or vegetable which I have trted or seen tried in this upper country, grows well,"" he concluded (Palmer 1847:167). With the play of these multiple factors, Americans turned their eyes and then cast their lives into the enterprise of emigrating to Oregon. A hardy few set out in 1839, arriving in 1840, and mare trickled westward in 1841 and 1842. The year 1843, however, gained notice as the commencement of pioneer travel; that season an estimated 900 men, women, and children and perhaps 3,000 head of livestock crossed the Oregon Trail. Inspired by the feat of Marcus Whitman in dragging the running gear of a wagon as far as Fort Boise in 1836, this crew felled trees and cleared a trace across the Blue Mountains to drag wagons as far as the Columbia River. In 1845 an estimated 3,000 emigrants traveled 31   to Oregon and by 1850 the non-Indian population of the territory had reached 11,873 (Bowen 1978:22-25: Unruh 1979:l 18-122). For the first two decades the new population settled almost exclusively in the valleys along the base of the Western Cascades in Oregon and Washington. The choice of new homes and townsites stemmed from several considerations: proximity to markets and navigable waters, fertility of soil, milling opportunities because of waterpower, logging and lumbering prospects, and the degree to which the relatively open valleys mirrored the Eastern Woodland setting familiar to those who relocated across the continent. The use of purposeful fire ecology by the Native Americans of that region--to harvest tarweed seeds and other foods on the valley floors, to stimulate regeneration of beny crops, and to maintain a relatively open, forest understory with browse for deer and elk--had given thousands of acres in the Nisqually, Cowlitz, Willamette, Umpqua, and Rogue watersheds the appearance of a magnificent park (Applegate 19 14:68-70: Palmer 1847:88- 100). There the first settlers selected their claims and made their homes. To those who had grown up in the environment of mixed meadowland, hardwood, and conifer forests of the eastern United States, the Snake Plains particularly seemed forbidding and beyond consideration by ""civilized' people. In 1845 Joel Palmer, when west of Fort Hall, noted: ""the road has been stony and dusty: the country mostly destitute of vegetation--nothing growing but the wild sage and wormwood"" (Palmer 1847:45). Riley Root in 1848, for example, cursed the dust, basalt flows, and heat along the Snake. When he arrived at Burnt River near the Oregon-Idaho border, he wrote: ""Oh, when shall I view, once more, a verdant landscape! One thousand miles of naked rocks! Landscape without soil! River bottoms with scarcely enough grass to support emigrant teams"" (Root 1955:25). Even the passage of the Oregon Donation Land Act in 1850 did 32   not whet the appetite of overland settlers to select sites east of the Columbia Gorge. Their eyes, as John Shively wrote in 1846, were focused on the ""sundown diggings of the West"" and those places lay west of the Cascade Mountains. The influx of people by the overland routes, however, set the stage by the 1860s for another look at the prospects of the region's interior.  33   5. Early Federal Indian Policy On August 14, 1848, Congress passed the Organic Act (9 Stat. 323) I, to create Oregon Territory. This statute created a frame of government for all of the region lying from the Rockies to the Pacific and between California and Canada. Section 14 carried westward the mechanisms and philosophy of the Ordinande of 1787 which provided for the orderly creation of new territories and stated `That the inhabitants of said territory shall be entitled to enjoy all and singular, the rights, privileges, and advantages granted and secured to the people of the territory of the United States northwest of the river Ohio . . . ."" Section 1 stated: `That nothing in this act contained shall be construed to impair the rights of person or property now pertaining to the Indians in said territory, so long as such rights shall remain unextinguished by treaty between the United States and such Indians . . . [Oregon Legislative Assembly 1854:28-34). The Organic Act thus extended the philosophy of ""utmost good faith"" dealings toward the Indian tribes and confirmed their aboriginal land title. It set the stage for a treaty program to clear that title and to institute relationships between the.tribes and the United States. The Organic Act was the product of warfare, the result of an unfortunate neglect of affairs in the Oregon country. On June 15. 1846. the Oregon Treaty recognized American sovereignty in the Pacific Northwest and the withdrawal of the Hudson's Bay Company to Canada. The treaty extended the 49th parallel as the boundary between the United States and Canada from the Rockies to the Pacific Ocean. Congress, however, did nothing to organize a territorial government. The quasi-legal Provisional Government founded by American settlers in 1841 wrestled with land claims, depredations of wild animals on livestock, market roads, and other matters. The annual influx of settlers--more than 3,000 in 1845~-suggested that stronger action was 34   needed. Congress did not provide it and, instead, focused on waging war against Mexico. Then in November, 1847, Cayuse Indians attacked the Whitman Mission at Waiilatpu. That event unleashed a war in the Columbia Basin which became the catalyst to compel Congress to create Oregon Territory, The Cayuse War proved tragic not only for those at the Whitman Mission but also for the Cayuse Tribe. Strained, tenuous relations had existed for a number of years as Whitman, his wife, and helpers had attempted to effect the religious and cultural transformation of the Indians. Matters took on a new dimension when Whitman returned from a trip to the East in 1843 and was followed within a few weeks by nearly 900 overland emigrants. Those numbers tripled three years later. The Cayuse, ravaged by smallpox, saw calamity pressing down upon them, their lands bisected by the Oregon Trail, their people dying in spite of the medical treatments of Whitman. Ultimately a few Cayuse men, enraged by the continuing flood of emigrants, Whitman's failings as a doctor to their people, and operating within the cultural justification that it was permissible to slay a doctor who did not cure, attacked the mission. Their bloody adventure unleased a six-month war of retribution. More than 500 soldiers in several military companies raised by the Provisional Government invaded the Cayuse homeland to pursue the perpetrators of the ""massacre."" Ultimately they brought the five alleged murderers to Oregon City where they were tried and hanged in 1850 (Lansing 1993; Ruby and Brown 1972:109-171; 1981:105-106). The federal government inaugurated its Indian policy in the Pacific Northwest in a faltering manner. It brought neither consistent program nor uniform policy. The officials of the Oregon Superintendency of Indian Affairs often lacked specific informotion about the tribes--their population, cultures, territories, and languages. They often did not possess the ability to communicate clearly and effectively with the tribal 35   leaders. The political agendas of the territorial legislatures sometimes delayed the~implementation of treaties and, on several occasions, blocked ratification of agreements made in duly constituted councils. Federal land policies, settler encroachment on Indian lands, and the machinations of unprincipled men who preyed on the Indians further exacerbated the relationships. The Pacific Northwest faced thirty years of conflict between the Cayuse War of 1847 and the resolution of the Nez Perce War of 1877 (Buan and Lewis 1991:39-45). The imperfection in implementation of federal Indian policy in the territory became evident when on September 27, 1850 (9 Stat. 496) Congress passed the act to provide for survey and disposition of public lands. Popularly known as the Donation Land Act, this measure led to first to the cadastral land survey system and ultimately to patents on 8,455 claims to approximately 2.8 million acres in the Pacific Northwest. Almost of these claims were filed upon prior to negotiation and ratification of treaties of Indian land cession. The claims included one in Idaho, two on the lower Walla Walla River, another on McKay Creek in the Umatilla watershed, and a nearly continuous chain of claims from Five Mile Rapids west via the Columbia Gorge. While the vast majority of the donation claims lay west of the Cascade Range, the law set the stage for further Indian discontent and, ultimately, warfare (Johansen and Gates 1967:234). The first major stages of treaty program unfolded in 1851 in the region west of the Cascades. The Willamette Valley Treaty Commission secured six treaties of land cession in the northern part of the valley to cede an area heavily settled by Americans in the 1840s. Unknown to the Commission, Congress had abrogated its treaty powers prior to its commencing the councils and.obtaining tribal agreement to the land cessions. Anson Dart, Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs, held in 1851 the Tansy Point Treaty Council and another at Port Orford on the 36   southwestern Oregon coast. Darts treaties, like those in the Willamette Valley, reserved small tracts of land for the Indians in their aboriginal areas. Samuel Thurston, the territorial delegate to Congress, mounted a strong opposition to these treaties and argued that all the Indians from west of the Cascades should be colonized east of the mountains. None of the first eighteen treaties secured ratification (Beckham 1984a). In 1853 Congress divided the jurisdiction for Indian Affairs between Oregon and Washington territories. In Oregon, Joel Palmer, author of an overland guidebook published in 1847, secured appointment as Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Isaac I. Stevens, director of the Pacific Railroad Surveys and governor, served in Washington. Both mounted active programs to secure Indian land cessions and create reservations. Following a series of treaty councils in western Washington in late 1854 and early 1855, ,Stevens summoned a number of Columbia Basin tribes to the Walla Walla Treaty Council. Supported by U.S. Army troops and working with Joel Palmer, Stevens pressed for agreements. The council led to treaties between June 9 and 11 with the Walla Walla, Cayuse, and Umatilla, the Yakima, and the Nez Perce. The treaties provided for numerous reserved rights. The federal government acknowledged that the tribes possessed the right ""of taking fish in all usual and accustomed places,"" of ""gathering roots and berries,"" of hunting, of erecting temporary buildings for curing fish, and of pasturing their horses and cattle ""upon open and unclaimed land."" In reserved land areas the tribes retained the ""exclusive right of taking fish"" in the streams running through or bordering their reservations (Kappler 1904[2]). Stevens continued his travels and on June 16, 1855, secured a treaty with the Flathead, Pend D'Oreille, and Kootenay tribes of western Montana. It contained the same reserved rights guarantees. On June 25, 1855, Palmer succeeded in his negotiations with the Tribes of Middle Oregon (Taih, Wyam, Tenino, John Day, Dalles Band of Wasco, Ki-tal37   twal-la Band of Wasco, and Dog [Hood] River Band of Wasco. This treaty created the Warm Springs Reservation and retained the reserved rights clauses (Kappler 1904[2]; O'Donnell 1991:210). None of the tribes north of the Yakima in central Washington participated in treaties with the United States. These people were removed to the Colville and Spokane reservations. On October 16, 1864, the Klamath, Modoc, and the Yahuksin Band of Northern Paiute signed a treaty ceding lands but reserving a 1 .l million acre reservation in the Klamath Basin. Other Northern Paiutes resided in south-central and southeastern Oregon. The Walpapi Band under chief Paulina signed a treaty on August 12, 1865, agreeing to cede lands and remove to the Klamath Reservation. The treaty of December 10, 1868, negotiated with Northern Paiutes at Fort Harney failed to secure ratification (Ruby and Brown 1986:156-l 58). The Bannock who resided in south-central Idaho allied with numerous Shoshoneans in the eastern part of the territory. The Bannocks participated on October 14, 1863, in an unratified treaty at Soda Springs, Idaho. The Treaty of Fort Bridger of July 3, 1868, involved both Bannock and Shoshonis and created the Wind River Reservation. The treaty program thus provided an incomplete settlement with the Indians of the Columbia watershed. Some tribes and bands secured ratified treaties with specific reserved rights. Others participated in councils but never secured ratification of their agreements. Still other tribes and bands remained outside of the treaty process altogether. These inconsistencies, the continued trespass of Euroamerican travelers, and the influx of miners and cattle drovers set the stage.for the Indian wars which beset these people in the mid-years of the nineteenth century. These conflicts erupted in the fall of 1855 with confrontations between miners traveling to the Colville mines and, fatally, in the murder of Indian sub-agent A. J. Bolan. The hostilities led the governors of 38   Oregon and Washington territories to raise companies of volunteers and Major Gabriel J. Rains deployed U.S. Army regulars into the Yakima homeland. The defeat of Major Granville 0. Holler and his infantry regulars in October, 1855, in their effort to enter the Yakima Valley confirmed that this war might prove costly. Further evidence arose dramatically in March, 1856, when the Yakima, Klickitat, and Cascades Chinookans swept through the Columbia Gorge to besiege Fort Lugenbeel, Fort Rains, and burned to the ground the headquarters post, Fort Cascades. The US. Army retreated down the Columbia to regroup and mount a counter offensive. General John Wool, commander of the Department of the Pacific, issued a highly unpopular order in 1856 to close the Columbia Basin to further settlement pending resolution of the war with the Indians and the confinement of the Yakima to a reservation (Victor 1894:423-430). General Newman S. Clarke replaced General Wool in 1857. The conflicts continued in 1858 when the Spokane Indians turned back the troops under Col. Edward J. Steptoe. The men retreated under attack to . Walla Walla. Major Robert Garnett led troops into the Yakima Valley, while Col. George Wright brought 500 soldiers in'to the region, killed between 800 and 900 head of Indian horses, and destroyed caches of winter food. These actions and summary executions the Indians alleged to have murdered Bolan and others brought an end of the Yakima War (Victor 1894:489-500). During the Civil War a series of engagement pitted the Northern Paiute of Central and Eastern Oregon against U.S. Army regulars. The Army established Fort Harney, Fort Klamath, Camp Warner, Camp Watson, and Camp Curry in the region. Oregon Volunteers took up positions at Camp Wright, Camp Polk, Camp Maury, Camp Logan, Camp Gibbs, Camp Dahlgren, Camp Alvord and other locations during their patrols in the region south of the Columbia River (Drake 1964:4-l 18). 39   The conflicts inexorably wore down the Indian resistance and led in 1873 to confinement of many of the Northern Paiute on the Malheur Reservation in the Harney Basin. Created by executive order in 1872, the reservation proved vulnerable to the agendas of cattlemen who soon secured its abolition and removal of the surviving Northern Paiute to other reservations (Meacham 1875). The Modoc War erupted in 1872, the result of long-smoldering hostilities between travelers on the Applegate Trail and the Indians residing in the lake region along the Oregon-California border. The war pitted Kietepoos, or Captain Jack, and his small band against the U.S. Army. Engaging in guertlla warfare from their stronghold in the lavalands along the margins of Tule Lake, the Modocs held a much superior force at bay for months. When they Modocs attacked the treaty commission, on April 11, 1873, they gained national attention for killing General E. R. S. Canby and others. Ultimately forced to surrender, the Modoc leaders were hanged and the surviving trlbol members removed to Oklahoma .  (Murray 1959). Warfare erupted in 1877 when the U.S. Army attempted to force the' Joseph Band'of Nez Perce in Oregon's Wallowa Valley to remove to the Nez Perce Reservation on the Clearwater River in Idaho. Insistent that the treaty 1855 had reserved their homeland and that they were not parties to a subsequent treaty ceding the area, the Nez Perce of the Wallowas were surrounded by eager livestock owners who coveted the lush benchlands along the Snake and lmnaha as well as the Wallowa Valley. Although Chief Joseph finally agreed to the removal, hostilities erupted before it was complete. He and his war chiefs then led the band on a circuitous route to try to escape the Army. Their ""retreat"" led them over the Lolo Trail, through Yellowstone National Park, and finally onto the Great Plains of Montana. The Nez Perce displayed remarkable skill in evading the pursuing armies, in engaging in combat, and moving 40   their families toward Canada. Nez Perce casualties tallied 151 dead and 80 wounded, while 127 soldiers and 50 civilians died in the conflict. Surrounded within a few miles of the border, the refugees were compelled to surrender and were removed to Kansas and finally to Oklahoma. Enduring terrible deprivations and death, the survivors were finally removed to Nespelem on the Colville Reservation (Johansen and Gates 1967:276: Josephy 1965; Josephy 1983:97-l 52). The Bannocks of Idaho who had signed the Treaty of Fort Bridger discovered that they had to share their annuities with the Shoshones who were moved onto their reservation. Never did the agents have sufficient food, clothing, or shelter. In the spring of 1878 Bannocks under Buffalo Horn and Egad headed toward the Malheur Reservation where they planned to unite with equally aggrieved Northern Paiute. Pursued by troops, the Bannocks endured defeat in July. The Army then pursued the Sheepeater Indians of Valley County, Idaho, finally capturing them in September and bringing to a close three decades of intermittent conflict between Euroamericans and Indians (Ruby and Brown 1981:256-257; Trenholm and Carley 1964:223-224:261-265). The early federal Indian policy in the Pacific Northwest exhibited numerous problems. The government failed to protect its promises of aboriginal land title and facilitated encroachment on the Indian domain by the Donation Land Act, survey of land, cash entry sales, and ultimately by the Homestead Act of 1862. The Bureau of Indian Affairs faltered in its treaty program, made promises but did not always secure ratification of treaties, and left many tribes and bands with no treaty relationship. The reservations proved vulnerable to reduction in size by executive orders and acts of Congress. Never did the agents have sufficient resources to mount adequate programs of health, education, and welfare for the Indians held on under their charge. When treaties had provided for reserved rights, the federol government did virtually 41   nothing to maintain its trust responsibility to the tribes in the face of individual and state assaults on tribal entitlements. The Indian program was furthered weakened by corruption of officials, incompetency in office, and inconsistency in policies. With few advocates and little ability to protect their interests other than to go to war, the Indian tribes were in an untenable situation. Thirty years of conflict, however, defined their fate--confinement to small tracts of lands and imposition of purposeful programs to accelerate their transformation into ""civilized"" persons who, perhaps someday, might be considered for citizenship in the United States. The ""civilization"" programs were premised on agriculture, English, and Chrlstainity. They were designed to destroy the languages, religions, and traditional cultures of the Indians of the Columbia Basin. While elements of the old lifeways continued, the pressure to change and conform beset the tribes for next century.  42   6. Euroamerican Settlement The grasslands of the Columbia Basin beckoned to the flood of overland settlers pouring across the Oregon Trail. Cattle owners in the Sacramento Valley of California also looked for places where they might feed their expanding herds before driving them to market. The millions of acres of Bluebunch Wheat Grass and the well-watered margins of rivers and remnant lakes suggested the potential of the region between the Cascades and the Rockies . The development of the great horse herds of the Cayuse, Nez Perce, Umatilla, Yakima, Klickitat, Northern Paiute, Bannack, and Shoshone demonstrated the viability of livestock operations. The Hudson's Bay Company and the missionaries had also tested the potentials for raising cattle, sheep, goats, and hogs at scattered points in the interior. Grasslands, gold, and generous federal land laws all played important parts in the spread of Euroamerican settlement into the vast region between the Rockies and the Cascades. Elizabeth Wood, on Oregon Trail emigrant, extolled the Gronde Ronde Valley when she,camped there in September, 1851: ""Its fertile soil produces several kinds of luxuriant grass--blue grass, timothy, clover, red top, and `broom corn' grass, that looks like oats, only the head is not heavy enough"" (Wood 1984:176-l 77). The following July, Jared Fox entered the same watershed and wrote: `The valley is covered with grass & wild grain. The wild wheat is up to the horses backs, the red top is a foot short of that. The June grass and red clover up to your knees"" (Fox 1852:43]. The great deterrent to settlement in the 1840s and the 1850s was distance. The region east of the Cascades was simply too far from dependable points of supply and markets. Between 1850 and 1855--the date of expiration of the donation land program--only a handful of settlers selected claims in the Columbia watershed. Entrepreneurs hoping to control the portage of the 43   Columbia filed for claims along its north bank at the Cascades. Another cluster of nearly a dozen took up lands along the south bank of the Columbia River from Crate's Point east to the townsite of The Dalles. A solitary claimant filed in the Umatilla watershed, a few others including the former Hudson's Bay Company trader William McBean, filed along the Walla Walla River, and only one, William Craig who married a Nez Perce woman, took land at Lapwai Creek in what was to become Idaho. The impact of the Donation Act which led to patents on over 2.6 million acres in the Pacific Northwest lay west of the Cascades. It was of little direct significance in the vast Columbia Basin (Josephy 1983:70; Johansen 1957:iii-viii). The federal government, however, laid down a structure to facilitate a somewhat orderly progression of settlement. The Organic Act of August 14, 1848, established Oregon Territory. This measure led to the appointment of Joseph Lane as governor and the implementation of government under his leadership in March, 1849. That year th,e War Department dispatched the Overland Riflemen, a contingent of U. S. Cavalry, to cross the Oregon Trail and establish military posts to insure peaceful relationships between Indians and emigrants. The Riflemen created Cantonment Loring, o temporary post near old Fort Hall on the upper Snake, and began construction of Fort Vancouver, a regional headquariers near the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers (Settle 1940). The Organic Act reserved the right to divide ""said territory into two or more territorie;."" Congress exercised the prerogative in 1853 to create Washington Territory and in 1863 to form Idaho Territory. These actions led to the appointment of officials, implementation of Bureau of Indian Affairs programs and reservation management, expansion of military patrols and posts, opening of General Land Offices and mounting of surveys, extension of postal services, and creation of the federal court 44   system. Each represented an investment of the resources of the people of the United States in the new territories and each contributed to the sense of stability attractive to settlement (Schwantes 1989:104-107). In time the allurements of lands east of the Cascades proved irrestible. Some embraced risk and took their chances beyond the mountains. In the summer of 1859 W. W. Chapman, surveyor-general of Oregon, reported emigrants from California, the Willamette Valley, and the eastern states were headed toward the interior with ""thousands of cattle and horses."" The establishment of Fort Walla Walla that year provided a good inducement for settlers to select claims in the Walla Walla Valley. General William S. Harney reported that ""some two thousand industrious and thriving settlers"" had located there (Oliphant 1968:81-82). Nancy C. Glenn, an emigrant on the Oregon Trail, well captured the feelings of prospective settlers when she reached the Grande Ronde Valley in October, 1862: This is one of the most beautiful valleys in the world surrounded by high mountains world almost William thinks it the most beautiful valley he ever saw and a plenty of the nicest timber and the best springs in the I wish you were all here and had provision enough But nearly all the emigrants that to last until you could raise some  has went down into Oregon this year intend coming back as soon as they can get back in the spring and I expect the land will then all be claimed up (Glenn 1989:24). Glenn's observations proved prophetic. Less than a year later James L. Bailey came to the same point and wrote: "". . . our teams jog[g]ing along the valley over a very good road in the direction of Lay Grand, a small town on the south west side of the valley"" (Bailey 1863). The course of settlement was well underway and already included a platted town 45   (Thompson 1863). Gold became the magnet which changed the pattern of settlement in 186263. Although small strikes had drawn miners to the Colville Mines of the northern Columbia Plateau in 185556 and others to the Fraser River, the mineral potentials remained largeiy unknown. Rumors of the fabled ""Blue Bucket Mine,"" a placer deposit allegedly found by the ""lost wagon train"" of 1845 which followed Stephen H. L. Meek across eastern and central Oregon, hinted at the prospects of easy wealth (Clark and Tiller 1966:107-121). For years, however, the region seemed devoid of valuable minerals. The course changed in 1862 with the simultaneous discovery ofplacer deposits ot several locations in the Columbia Basin. These included rich deposits on the upper John Day River in the vicinity of Canyon City, on the upper Powder River at Auburn and Sumpter, at Florence, Idaho, on the Salmon River, and at Pierce City and Orofino in the Clear-water country of Idaho. Soon miners found other rich deposits in the Boise Basin and in the higher elevations of the Blue Mountains at Granite and Greenhorn. These strikes drew in thousands of miners who, in turn, created markets for stockraisers and farmers eager to take up lands in the interior of the Pacific Northwest. The gold discoveries in the interior of British Columbia served as a further opportunity. Miners rushed to the Cariboo country. They were hungry men. In 1862 James Heatherly and A. J. Welch of Lane County left with 800 sheep and 300 or 400 head of cattle for the Cariboo mines. The Pacific Christian Advocate (Portland, OR.) reported by October that over 46,000 head of cattle had crossed the Cascades that season for the interior (Oliphant 1968:64). Congress played a critical role as well with the passoge in 1862 of the Homestead Act. It created a mechanism whereby would-be settlers could obtain up to 160 acres of public lands for free, provided they paid 46   a modest filing fee and met the terms of proof.  Congress also  addressed the interests of miners. The Mining Law of 1866 opened mineral lands on the public domain to all. The claims were to be worked according to local mining law and, when the miner could demonstrate $1,000 in labor and improvements, he could secure patent. The Placer Mining Law of 1870 extended claims to non-lode deposits with patenting at the rate of $2.50 per acre. The General Mining Law of 1873 limited lode locations to 1,500 feet in length and 600 feet in width and said that individual claimants were limited to 20 acres, while associations or groups might claim up to 160 acres. The law required $100 in annual assessment work and a minimum of $500 in improvements as a condition for patent (Muhn and Stuart 1988:17-19). Thousands weighed the prospects of emerging boom towns, markets for agricultural commodities, fertile lands, and rich placer and lode deposits. Many thought the gamble worthwhile. Thus, while the eastern United States was convulsed in the Civil War, the Columbia Basin began a period of rapid settlement. In the decade of the 1860s Euroamericans began taking up lands in well-watered areas. The Klamath Basin, Goose Lake Valley, Warner Valley, John Day drainage, Powder River Valley, and Grande Ronde Valley in Oregon, the Walla Wallo drainage in Washington, and the Boise River and lower Clearwater country of Idaho stood high in the interest of the settlers and drovers. These places possessed thousands of acres of fertile bunchgrass, held the prospect of irrigation, and were, in several instances, located within reasonable distance of nearby mining camps. Harvey Hines, a Methodist minister who traveled widely in the region east of the Cascades, wrote in 1882 of the prospects of the region: What we call the `bunch grass country' is that lying between the Cascade and Blue mountain ranges, a distance east and west of 47   1.50 miles in round numbers, and frcm the Coeur d'Alene mountains to the high ridges that run from the Blue mountains westward, about a hundred miles south of the Columbia river, a distance north `and south of not less than 250 miles. There are tracts within these limits that may be called `sage brush land,' as a large part of the Yakima valley and the lower Snake river valley; but, in general, with these exceptions, it is covered with a comparatively clean growth of bunch grass. Hines also described the Snake country above Hells Conyon and reaching east toward the Rockies. This area he denominated ""sage brush country"" extending: over nearly the whole of the main tributary valleys of the Snake river . . Powder river valley, the great valley of Snake river from the mouth of Burnt river to Fort Hall, a distance of say four hundred miles, and with a width of fifty miles; and the Malheur plains and hills sweeping southward around the southern end of the Blue Mountain range, are mainly of this character. There are limited exceptions to this description, as where the hills rise to a great altitude they are covered with bunch grass, or in the lower bottoms along the streams they are set with either rye grass or a native red top and clover. Even the sage region, however, Hines found productive. ""It may be said,"" he wrote, ""this white sage furnishes remarkably nutritious winter forage for cattle, and the places where it flourishes best, are a kind of winter haven for the herds of the `cattle kings""' (Hines 18820, 1882b). The cottle kings brought their vaqueros, herds, and determination to take up lands in the hinterlands of the Pacific Northwest. In the late 1860s the drovers scouted the remote stretches of Guano, Catlow, and 48   the Pueblo valleys. By the fall of 1869 drovers had an estimated 900 head of cattle and 100 head of horses in the Goose Lake Valley. The Oregon Weekly Statesman reported 10,656 head of cattle were in the Umatilla watershed. Barney Prine, founder of Prineville on the Crooked River, reported several thousand head of sheep and over 2,000 cattle on the Ochoco. That fall drovers brought in ""large bands of Texas cattle"" to Idaho's Raft River Volley. John S. Devine and W. B. Todhunter located their herds in the Alvord region southeast of Steens Mountain. Other cattlemen staked out pastures in the Klickitat and Yakima watersheds (Oliphant 1968:85-100). Congress aided the eastward flow of settlers from the area west of the Cascades by massive grants of lands to the State of Oregon for transfer to wagon road componies. Created under the guise of ""military wagon roads"" for the expeditious movement of troops and supplies between the settled regions and newly opening londs east of the mountains, the road construction held out the prospect of securing three square miles of land on either side of each mile of road built. These grants in the 1860s led to the operations of three companies. The Oregon Central Military Wagon Road Company, founded by investors at the head of the Willamette Valley, surveyed a route via the Middle Fork of the Willomette River across the Cascades to the headwaters of the Deschutes. Rather than proceeding directly east toward Fort Boise--as prescribed in the program--the surveyors turned south into the Klamath Basin, then east to pass through the Goose Lake Volley, Warner Valley, Guano Valley, Catlow Valley, and Pueblo Valley. The company's circuitous route through well-watered lake and marsh areas gave it opportunity to claim valuable grazing acreage (Beckham 1981[1]:9-41). The Cascade Mountain-Willamette Valley Wagon Road, laid out in 1866 by investors in the mid-Willamette Valley, built east from Albany via the South Santiom River to the Deschutes. Its route headed on east via the 49   Crooked River Valley through the northern part of the Harney Basin and then northeast toward Boise (Guminski et al. 1983:19-22). The Fort DallesFort Boise Wagon Road moved southeasterly from The Dalles via the John Day watershed to cross the Blue Mountains and converge at Boise. While charges of inadequate construction, fraud, and use of the grants merely as a device to secure title to hundreds of thousands of acres of Oregon lands swirled around the road companies, they did survey and--to some extent--lay out wagon routes into the interior of the Pacific Northwest. They obtained lands which their investors either sold or developed in conjunction with cattle drovers. The Oregon Central Military Wagon Road Company, for example, secured title by 1875 to 361,327 acres out of a potential 806,400 acres transferred to the state for its purposes. The Cascade Mountain-Willamette Valley Wagon Road Company secured 860,000-acres by 1871 (U.S. Senate 1887:74-75). The military wagon road program in Oregon became yet another stimulus to induce the children of the Oregon Trail generation to cast their lives and fortunes in the region cost of the Cascades. The General Land Office played an important supporting role in the advance of settlement into the Snake Plains, Bitterroot Valley, Columbia Plateau, and High Desert regions of Oregon. In response to petitions of settlers, the GLO contracted with surveyors to mount subdivisions of townships to facilitate the orderly disposition of the public domain. By 1852 the basic pattern wos in place with the Willamette Meridion and the Baseline serving as the basic grid for all of Oregon and Washington, Subsequent to the creation of Idaho Territory in 1863 the GLO established the Boise Meridian and Baseline as the basis for surveys east to the Rocky Mountains. The course of survey moved rapidly in settled areas. Prior to 1863 the surveyors had worked in the Klamath Basin lower Deschutes, and Umatilla watersheds in Oregon. Over the next twenty years they subdivided nearly all of the eastern two-thirds of 50   the state. Only the highest elevations or most arid desert regions awaited their examination (O'Callaghon 1960: Loy et al. 1976:9). The General Land Office administered the programs created by Congress for the disposition of the public domain. In the Columbia Basin several statutes proved of considerable significance, at least in attracting would-be claimants. Beyond the opportunity to purchase lands through cash entry, the Homestead Act (1862) proved highly popular. The law stated that heads of households, widows, and single people over the age of twenty-one could file upon 160 acres under the Preemption Law (1841). Claimants then had to reside on the land for five years and cultivate it, or, if they wished, they might commute the claim to a cash entry ond pay the minimum price per acre. Of interest in the arid interior of the Pacific Northwest was the Desert Land Law (1877). This law permitted filing upon 640 acres at a~ price of $1.25/acre and the issue of a patent if the claimant could bring the land under irrigation within three years. The law applied to Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Washington, Oregon, and four other western territories or states. The Forest Homestead Act (1906) permitted settlers who could find lands within forest reserves with demonstrated agricultural potentials to enter upon such lands under the Homestead Act. The Enlarged Homestead Act (1909) responded to the demands of people seeking to engage in dryland forming. This law gave 320 acres to claimants seeking lands not susceptible to irrigation. The law required residency and planting of one-eighth of the tract. The Three-Year Homestead Law (19 12) reduced the five-year residency requirement by two years. The Stockraising Homestead Act (19 16) allowed individuals to file upon 640 acres if the land was chiefly valuable for grazing or forage crops. The law required residency and improvements to the value of $1.25 per acre. Collectively these laws opened avenues for ambitious and lucky settlers to carve out o property of several hundred acres, provided they 51   met the terms of the statutes. Some did. Congress thus lured settlers into the Columbia and Snake watersheds by its land laws (Muhn and Stewart 1988: 14-36). Throughout the Columbia Basin by the 1870s there existed new communities. Far-flung counties coped with providing basic services of recording deeds and mining claims, operating courts, surveying market roads, and providing a semblance of low and order. The mining towns provided the initial stimulus and took on an immediate urban cast. They provided both goods and services to a laboring population. These included general stores, blacksmith shops, hotels, restaurants, boarding houses, saloons, livery stables, and, sometimes, small sawmills. Because of their focused labor in the diggings, the miners anticipated and received fair delivery of services. These might include laundry work, carpentry, banking, legal assistance, and medical care. The aspirations of the mining era communities were mirrored in their euphemistic names: Florence City, Pierce City, Silver City, Baker City, Canyon City. Scarce a community dared be less than an instant metropolis. Community growth throughout the region was rapid. Frances Fuller Victor noted it, for example, when she described communities on the eastern flank of Washington Cascades. `The First place of any consequence which we come to after possing the mining towns of Cleee-lum and Roslyn is Ellensburg, in Kittitass County,"" she wrote. ""It was first settled in 1867, by two families. The present population is five thousond."" Of Spokane, Victor was even more expansive and enthusiastic. She described its dramatic growth from a mid-1870s milling site into a city of granite, brick, and cast-iron buildings, including some from three to seven stories tall. ""An opera-house costing over a quarter of a million, a hotel costing nearly two hundred thousand dollars, a handsome postoffice, cable and electric street roilroods, electric and gas lighting, the power furnished by the falls, water-works, and every other modern 52   appliance of CI luxurious civilization, are to be found here,"" she wrote (Victor 189 1:365). In Idaho successive colonies of Mormon agriculturalists took up lands along the upper tributaries of the Snake. Responding to the good soil and climate along Goose Creek, Raft River, and the Blackfoot River, they coped with isolation through the special bonds of their religious community and its social life. Steadily in the 1870s Idaho spawned a succession of new counties as settlers turned irrigation water onto the sagebrush flats to raise wheat, oats, barley, and potatoes as well as grazing their cattle on the meadow grass in the steam bottoms (Bancroft 1890541-560). The spread of settlement continued across the far-flung Columbia Basin. The first generation took the fertile, well-watered stream courses. The second generation filed upon or purchased the more marginal creek courses and higher elevation meadows. The early twentieth century homesteaders gambled on the arid and marginal High Desert regions. Increasingly the succession of settlers lived more and more problematically. Lacking irrigation, coping with isolation, struggling to make proof on their homesteads or Desert Land Entries, those who poured into this region--and several tens of thousands did so in the first two decades of the twentieth century--were risk takers. Few possessed a choice. Inspired by a desire to own CI place of their own, embracing the agrarian dream when it was far more likely to prove mythic than real, they endured numerous problems. Alice Day Pratt was one of those who cast her luck on a homestead in the Columbia Basin in 1911.. A schoolteacher who had lived in Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Carolina, Pratt traveled west by train and taught in Athena, Oregon, while a locator found her a claim in the Ochoco country of central Oregon. Pratt's homestead lay nearly thirty-five miles from Prineville. Her situation was not unlike that of 53   many who tried to find a future in the region: Fifty miles to westward passed the nearest railroad line: one hundred and fifty miles to eastward the next nearest. Northward and southward the distance was so great OS  to be non-  negotiable. On every hand, high, dry, and untamed stretched the Central-Oregon plateau. Richly timbered mountains and deep river clefts made occasional dots and lines upon its vastness. No human habitation was in sight (Pratt 1993:47) For five years she coped with meeting ""proof' on her 160 acre claim. Lacking resources to purchase lumber or the means to fell and haul logs to erect a cabin, Pratt resided in a tent-cabin. She labored as her own ""beast of burden"" to clear sage, fell junipers, dig post holes, set fences, and split firewood. She coped with coyotes, hawks, and rabbits. A would-be chicken farmer, she eked out an existence, praying she might secure sufficient money to obtain a milk cow and horse. Her neighbors--a number of them of the first generation who had taken bettc: lands in the 1870s. she found rude and unhelpful. As to men, she concluded: `The relationship of confirmed bachelors is like a second childhood."" Pratt's survival was almost a miracle. ""Being penniless, I had no wood put in,"" she recalled, ""but continued to depend upon my own daily exertions, although available fuel was retreating always farther from the fire, for even one lone homesteader can burn a huge amount of wood in the course of two years' time."" Finally in o blinord, desperate for heat, Pratt burned her chopping block. And when it did not abate, she was compelled on the next day to burn her ladder (Pratt 1993:86121). Thousands who came to the Columbia Basin's rurol lands simply had to ""make do."" Compelled by statutory requirements to reside on their claims but lacking the capital to improve their lot, they risked their 54   lives for the sake of land. Many foiled. The records of the General Land Office confirm that thousands encountered shattered dreams. The notes ""relinquished' or ""concelled"" mark a record of repeated efforts of agrarians to try to make a go of life in a challenging environment. The fieldstone foundations of their cabins, the traces of their hand-dug wells, and the scatter of broken dishes and rusting enamelware on the parched soil are mute evidence of their efforts. Not all found their calling in a land that can be harsh and unforgiving. Success came easier for the first to arrive because they got the lands providing on easier lot. Experience proved a master teacher,' however, and for every ten who moved on, one or two remained. Such was the nature of early settling.  55   7. Transportation The evolution of tronsportotion which nurtured the commercial development of the Columbia Basin emerged by design, ambition, and hard labor. The patterns fell into place fairly early and established a flow of raw materials and goods which fed the pulse of growing communities and as well OS  the scattered rural population of the region.  In the 1840s the federal government mounted two reconnaissance missions in the interior. In 1841 a detachment of the U.S. South Seas Surveying and Exploring Expedition ascended the Columbia, passed through the Gorge, and mapped the land as far east as the Hudson's Bay Company's Fort Wallo Walla. In 1843 John C. Fremont of the Topographical Engineers led his exploring westward over the Oregon Trail. Whjle these parties contributed journals and maps, the Pacific Railroad Surveys of 1854-56 played a far more significant role. Premised on the assumption that a transcontinental railroad was bot.h practical and desirable, Congress funded multiple expeditions carried out under the direction of Jefferson Davis, Secretary of War. The goal of the exploring parties was to find the most suitable route for d railroad--one with amenable terrain, feasible cost, and potential for year-round operation (Goetzmann 1966:281). The surveys were multi-faceted, involving naturalists, geologists, ethnographers, and cartographers. Critical to the location of transportation corridors were the engineers who examined the countryside for grades, curves, tunnels, bridges, and the technical feasibility of the routes. The most ambitious of all the surveys was that of Isaac lngalls Stevens, newly named governor of Washington Territory. Stevens headed west from Fort Union at the junction of the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers. He directed Capt. George B. McClellan to mount a comparable survey from Puget Sound east over the Cascades. The plan 56   was for the two parties to meet in the interior. This Northern Division survey located five passes through the northern Rockies: Lewis and Clark's Pass, Cadotte's Pass, Hell-Gate, Lolo, and Morias. The men also found that old fur trade routes via lakes Coeur d'Alene and Pend d'oreille provided a critical way around the northern Bitterroots. McClellan, however, fared poorly in the Cascades. Hesitant about the altitudes and possible snow depths, he examined the approach to Snoqualmie Pass but dismissed it and other routes as likely to be buried in winter snows (Overmeyer 1941:55-60; Stevens 1859[ 12]:32-33: Stevens 1901[1]:394-395). The surveys mounted under the direction of Gov. Stevens secured an enormous amount of information about the northern portion of the Columbia Basin and its connections to the east and the west. Confident that he had found a potential railroad route, Stevens joined other investors to secure a charter in January, 1857, for the Northern Pacific Railroad Company. Capitalized initially at $15.000.000, the firm planned to build west from Nebraska via the northern Rockies and the Bitter Root Valley to the Columbia Plateau. There the company envisioned two lines--one crossing the Cascades to Puget Sound and the other heading down the Columbia (Stevens 1901[2]:265). In Oregon the Pacific Railroad Surveys mounted by Lt. Henry L. Abbot and Col. Robert Stockton Williamson included an examination of the watershed of the Deschutes and the Klamath Basin. Their goal was to find a potential north-south route as well as to assess the potentials of a number of passes across the Cascades. They found six passes but concluded that only three--one south of Mount McLaughlin, another south of Diamond Peak, and o third south of Mount Hood crossing into the Clockomas watershed had potentials for railroad use (Abbot and Williamson 1857[6]:30-31 J. The U.S. Army entered the road survey and construction mission 57   with the Cascades Portage Road via the Columbia Gorge.  Lt. George  H. Derby surveyed and constructed the route in 1855-56 from Fort Vancouver to the Upper Portage at the Cascades, o distance of 46 miles. The goal of the Topographical Engineers was to build an allweather route which would permit the Quartermaster Department to move supplies to military posts throughout the Columbia Basin without constraints of competing portage companies or weather (Beckhom 1984b:93- 106). The spread of military posts and the acute need of connections via the northern Rockies inspired the military to proceed with the Mullen Road. Lt. John Mullen had served with Governor Stevens in 1853 in mounting the Northern Division Pacific Railroad Surveys, Realizing that a wagon road would prove invaluable OS  an adjunct to eventual railroad  construction, Stevens ordered Mullen to seek a suitable wagon road route from Fort Benton, the head of navigation on the Missouri in Montana, to Fort Wolla Wollo on the Columbia River. Mullon interviewed former fur trappers and missionary priests and discovered that wagon travel from the Bitterroot Valley east to Fort Benton was relatively easy. He then concentrated on alternatives from present Missoula to Walla Walla by examining three routes: one via the Clark Fork, another via St. Regis-Coeur d'Alene, and a third across Lolo Pass into the Clearwater country of central Idaho. After eleven difficult days crossing from Lolo Creek to Weippe Prairie, Mullen ruled out Lolo Pass through the LochsoClearwater drainage (Space 1970:41). In the spring of 1854 Mullen brought o train of wagons over the route and proved its practicability. Congress in 1855 appropriated $30,000. The Indian wars of 1855-58 so occupied the military, however, that construction languished. Ultimately in 1859 Congress oppropriated another $100,000 and the army proceeded with cutting and partially grading the route--624 miles across the interior of the Columbia Basin, 58   over the Rockies, and to o terminus at the steamboat landing at Fort Benton. The route opened in August, 1862, and an army unit crossed it in 57 days. ""Compared to twentieth-century highways,"" noted historian Carlos Schwantes, ""the Mullan Road was primitive: its grades were steep and in some places impassoble in wet weather."" In the Bitterroot and Coeur d'Alene mountains it was more of a pack trail than a road. The road, however, served the mining camps of the region and became another link in the transportation systems (Bancroft 1890:199-200, 384: Schwantes 1989: 149). Anticipating possible worfare with the Mormons in Utah, General William S. Harney in 1858 dispatched Capt. Henry D. Wallen to survey a wagon road from Fort Dalles across the Blue Mountains to the Great Salt Lake. The commitment to this enterprise proved substantial. Wallen's reconnaissance party included nine officers, 184 enlisted men, 154 horses, 344 mules, 121 oxen, 30 wagons, and an ambulance. Wallen ascended the Deschutes, turned east via the Crooked River, explored the Harney Basin, and moved into the Snake watershed east of Fort Boise. Historian W. Turrentine Jackson subsequently wrote: `This party was undoubtedly the largest and best equipped of any engaged in wagonrood survey and construction for the United States Army in the transMississippi West."" The Army, however, took no further action to develop this route across the Columbia Bosin (Jackson 1952:84-86). On the eve of the Civil Wor the federal government launched one further important survey into the Columbia Basin. Although not focused on the development of a transportation route, the ambitious enterprise involved four years of field work and the accumulation of extensive amounts of data. This was the Northwest Boundary Survey which loid out the boundary with Canada from the summit of the Rockies to Puget Sound. Directed by Archibald Campbell, this expedition included not only surveyors but also naturalists and ethnogrophers. The work in 1859 59   and 1860 included the transit of the region east of the Cascades into western Montana. Its labors at lost completed, the crew set out for Woshington, D.C., to prepare scientific reports and maps for publication The Civil War intervened and its data remained as an obscure manuscript collection, never seen and seldom, if ever, cited (Beckham 1969: 193-224; Deutsch 1962: 17-33). A sense of opportunity drove the entrepreneurs who risked their modest capital and energies to develop the region's eorly transportation systems. In 1850 Bradford 8 Company, a pool of investors who had fiied on adjoining donation claims along the north bank of the Columbia at the Cascades, opened as mule-drawn portage enterprise with carts to haul the meager possessions of emigrants along five miles of difficult terrain at the lowest rapids on the Columbia River (Gillette 1904:121). In 1855 Joseph Ruckel and Harrison Olmstead opened a competing line-the Oregon Portage--on the opposite bank. Steamboats plied the Columbia from the Cascades west to Portland and Astoria and, in 1851, investors initiated service from the Upper Cascades east to The Dalles. Capt. John Ainsworth, one engaged in running those vessels, saw the larger prospect. In league with William S. Ladd, Robert R. Thompson, and Simeon Reed, he bought out Ruckel and Olmstead and then persuaded Bradford & Company to agree in 1860 to a division of the portage business between the two lines. In those carefully orchestrated transactions, Ainsworth goined a monopoly and from it emerged the Oregon Steam Navigation Company (Gill 1924:174-235). The OSN Company not only had visionary leadership. Luck played a part OS  well. In 1860 the firm bought out Orlando Humason who had  established a freight business via a portage wagon road east of The Dalles to the steamboat landing at the mouth of the Deschutes. The OSN Company thus added this critical portage to its emerging stranglehold on the commerce along the Columbia River. In 1862 60   Ainsworth made another strategic acquisition--20 miles of track and a steam locomotive. He shipped these from San Francisco and laid plans to install portage railroads along the Oregon shore at the Cascades and along the rapids east of The Dalles. These actions at last persuaded Bradford and Company to sell out to the OSN Company. ""This was our grand victory!"" exulted Ainsworth. The OSN Company by late 1862 thus controlled both of the Cascades portoges as well as the critical south bank of the Columbia from the Deschutes to The Dalles. The firm could play monopoly (Ainsworth 1877-94). The vision of the founders in the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, however, extended far beyond the western margin of the Columbia Plateau. In short order the investors constructed the Colonel Wright, a steamboat which they placed in service from the mouth of the Deschutes to Wallula Gap. In time they created an extensive system of transportation connections which reached to Missoula, Montana, the upper Snake, as well as the gold rush boom towns throughout the Columbia Basin. With steamboats, portage railroads, freight wagons, and stage coaches, the OSN Company hauled freight and passengers. Its Columbia River vessels also carried livestock. Within a decade its primary investors were millionaires. The ambitious projects of the OSN Company anticipated by a few months the explosion of population and commerce into the interior of the Pacific Northwest. When cattle drovers and miners discovered the potentials of the region, the OSN Company had its steamboats and portage lines in place. All it needed to do was to acquire freight wagons, stage coaches, and additional steamboats to create a transportation system to knit the scattered mining camps and emerging new towns to its main lines. The company accomplished that handily. A measure of its success was confirmed in the mounting tally of passengers and freight passing over its Cascade portoges. 61   Table 2. Portage Activity, Cascades of the Columbia River, 1861-64 Year 1861 1862 1863 1864 Passengers 10,500 24,500 22,000 36,000 Tons of Freight 6,290 14,550 16,646 24,834  (Office of the Chief of Engineers 1867) Another measure of the flow of commerce appeared in the Oregon Sfofesmon (Salem, OR.) of April 20, 1863. A correspondent who signed his name ""Veritas,"" wrote from The Dalles: Some idea may be formed of the number of men and amount of freight going from here direct to the mines overland, from the fact that an average of 200 pack animals and from ten to twelve freight wagons, carrying from 3,000 [to] 5,000 pounds each, leave town daily, and miners probably averoge not less than 150 per day, bound in vorious directions. For some time past John Day river mines appear to have carried the day with most of them, though many ore bound for Boise (Oliphant 1968:60). In the late 1850s both U.S. Army personnel and local road companies also examined several of the Cascade passes in Washington Territory for potential wagon roads (Bancroft 1890:384-3851.. Congress expanded the federal commitment to rood development in the interior of the Pacific Northwest with a series of land grants to the state of Oregon in 1864-66 to stimulate construction of ""military wagon roads."" Three projected lines crossed the Cascades to converge on Boise, Idaho. These were the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road (Eugene-Boise), the Cascade Mountain and Willamette Valley Wagon Road (Albany-Boise), 62   ond The Dalles-Fort Boise Wagon Road via the John Day watershed and the northern Horney Basin. Congress transferred hundreds of thousands of acres to the state which, in turn, possed title to the road companies. While critics charged the construction was bogus and the roads impassable, the program nevertheless created new arteries for movement of livestock, freight wagons, and travelers (Jackson 1949:2329). The wagon roads and the network of connections crafted by the Oregon Steam Navigation Company in the 1860s followed old Indian trails, trapper routes, and the Oregon Trail. By the mid-1860s the interior possessed central points for supply and distribution: The Dalles, Umatilla, Wallula, Walla Walla, White Bluffs (on the Columbia River], and Lewiston. Access to these distribution centers varied. Pivotal was the route via the Gorge and the Columbia River. In time, however, alternate avenues of supply to the distribution centers included the following: A Fort Benton, Montana, westward via the Mullen Road to the Bitterroot Valley * Chico, Colifornia, northeast via Honey Lake, Humboldt River, to the Owyhee watershed and Boise Basin A Kelton, Utah, on the Central Pacific Railroad northword to the Snake Plain and to western Montana: northwestward toward the western Snake Plain and the Boise Bosin A Corrine, Utah, on the Central Pacific Railroad northward to western Montana via the upper Snake These routes drew packers, freighters, and stage operators. Some who secured mail contracts found the enterprise lucrative. Others prospered as long as a mining population paid high prices for necessary commodities. When the mines played out, the transportation enterprise slackened and, in some instances, became sporadic or terminated (Meinig 1968:214-219). 63   The opening of mines on the Owyhee in 1863 stimulated a rush of miners who poured into Ruby and Silver City. As in previous strikes, the influx of hundreds of laborers drove the development of transportation systems to meet the needs of the new communities. The Owyhee mines thus led to the opening of pock mule and difficult wagon transportation from Jordan Creek to McDermitt, Nevada (Bancroft 1890:419-420). The prospects for maturation of a transportation network throughout the Columbio Basin turned on the building of roilroad lines. The portage lines at the Cascades and Celilo were the beginning. The Walla Walla and Columbia River Railroad, constructed in 1874-75 from Wallula to Walla Walla, became another link. The road connected viable steamboat transportation at Wallula to the great wheat belt of southeastern Washington. Geographer Donald W. Meinig has noted: ""Though long building, this little narrow-gauge was an instant success for , its builder and an important stimulus to farming expansion. Settlers moved south into the vacant lands in the Oregon sector of the valley and north toward Dry Creek and beyond."" To continue its hold on transportation, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company in 1877 purchased this line. It had increased its Columbia River traffic since 1875 by placing four additional steamboats on the run between Celilo and Wallula. This made a total of six of its ships plying that section of the Columbia (Meinig 1968:242, 251, 256). In the late 1860s Collis P. Huntington, Charles Cracker, Leland Stanford, and Mark Hopkins emerged as principals in the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads. Facing the rugged terrain of the Sierras as well as the necessity to find laborers to construct by hand hundreds of miles of right-of-way, they persevered and secured massive federal land grants and loons to build their lines. The two railroads joined in 1869 at Promontory Point, Utah. The route became highly significant in the development of the Columbia Basin in the latter nineteenth century. Not 64   only did its depots and warehouses at Kelton and Corrine feed supplies into the Snoke watershed, its sidings and loading chutes became important points for export of cattle, horses, and sheep from the stockraisers all across the Columbia Bosin. The Northern Pacific Railroad, chartered in 1864, was another beneficiary of congressional largess in the Civil War era. To encourage the building of this line from St. Paul to Puget Sound, Congress granted the company 60,000,000 acres--an area six times the size of New England. When the company violated some of the terms of its grant, it was penalized acreage. Nevertheless, the Northern Pacific eventually secured 39.000.000 acres--twice the amount awarded to dny of sixty-one different land-grant roilroads subsidized in the years 1862-71. The Northern Pacific swept westward across the Great Plains, crossed Montana looping north of Lake Pend D'Oreille, reached. Spokane and turned southwesterly to Pasco. There it crossed the Columbia and moved via the Yakima Valley and Ellensburg to cross the Cascades at Stampede Pass to Tacoma. Politicians, investors, and laborers celebrated completion of this transcontinental line with a spike ceremony at Gold Creek, Montana, on September 8, 1883 (Schwantes 1989:139-l 47). Its route over the Cascade Range was not completed until 1887 (Bancroft 1890:387). Henry Villard, a German-born journalist, had orchestrated the ambitious efforts of the Northern Pacific Railroad. Supported by German investors, in the 1870s Villard first bought out the Oregon Steam Navigation Company. Having secured that corporation's key portage rights-of-way, he began construction of the Oregon Railway 8. Navigation Company's line via the Columbia Gorge. The OR 8, N extended east to Wallula and there joined the Walla Walla and Columbia River Railroad to tap the wheat country. The Oregon Short Line, a subsidiary, built southeasterly in 1884 via the Blue Mountains to 65   Huntington,`Oregon, where it connected with the Union Pacific. The Up line led east from Weiser along the north bank of the Snake River to Pocotello. There it turned south to connections in Utah and in (Schwontes 1989:154-1X). The subsequent history of rail transportation in the Columbia Basin was a process of rapid filling in of feeder lines. Some investors had ambitions of linkages south to Utah, Nevada, and California, while others like James J. Hill envisioned and built yet another transcontinental line. Hill's Great Northern reached westward from St. Paul to Puget Sound in 1893. In the meantime investors in Montana--arguing that a million a year was expended for freight wagons on the route north form the Union Pacific at Corinne, Utah, founded the Utah Northern to construct a line for 300 miles. This railroad reached the Snake River and continued on through the Marsh Valley and Port Neuf in 1881 to Helena (Bancroft 1890684-687). The Columbia B Palouse became yet another line to build into the wheat country of eastern Washington. In the early twentieth century branch lines extended south to Friend, Bend, and Shaniko, Oregon--each opening the prospect for hauling agricultural commodities or logs and lumber. The last, major new route to penetrate the region was the Chicago, St. Paul & Milwaukee Railroad. This company extended its line westward from South Dakota to enter the Columbia Plain at Tekoa south of Spokane. The railroad extended through the Palouse country, crossed the Columbia, reached to Ellensburg. and crossed the Cascades via Snoqualmie Pass to terminate in 1909 in Seattle. That same year owners of the Northern Pacific and Great Northern completed the Spokane, Portland, and Seattle (SP & S) via the north bank of the Columbia River through the Gorge to Vancouver, Washington, and on to Puget Sound. (Meinig 1989:384). During t~he years 1880-1915 the railroads knit a tight skein of transportation throughout the Columbia Basin. Small depots became Wyoming.   warehouse sites and some blossomed into townsites. The lines sometimes drove unreasonable expectations. Each terminus saw itself as a future metropolis. When capital failed to extend the line farther or when business fell off, towns languished. A number of ambitious local entrepreneurs joined their lines to the major railroads. David Eccles, a Baker county investor, for example, built his railroad southwesterly to Sumpter then crossed the Blue Mountains to Prairie City in the upper John Day watershed . The eighty-mile long Sumpter Valley Railroad opened the pine forests of the southern Blue Mountains for logging and lumbering (Culp 1972:91-95). Similarly the Oregon Trunk Railroad opened the eastern flank of the Cascades when it built to Bend in 1911 and to Chemult in 1916 near the head of the Klamath Basin (Vaughan 1981:200201). Railroads in the 1880s tied the Columbia Basin to a larger world. They transformed the emigrant experience. A trip which heretofore had taken four to six months became possible in five days. The railroads made possible the shipment of heavy farm and industrial equipment, the movement of massive stockpiles of wheat and wool, or the hauling of cattle, lumber, and canned salmon to national and world markets. An investor with capital might purchase by ""mail order"" a prefabricated house, take delivery of it at the depot, and erect it according to standard plans in almost any town served by a rail line. The railroads brought the region into the nation's economy. Misfortunes in distant bond markets and financial ups and downs reverberated through the small communities of the interior of the Pacific Northwest. High hopes and dismal prospects rode the rails with the advent of transcontinental ties. The road system of the Columbia Basin remained rudimentary and problematic. Freighters coped with sand, ravines, snows, freshets, and minimal development. Many routes for several decades were little more 67   than pack trails and served single-file mules better than wagons or horsedrawn stage coaches. Neither the territories nor the states in the Pacific Northwest viewed roads as their responsibility until World War I. if roads were to be built, either they were the original military routes, the landgrant military wagon roads, or local market roads. The vast majority of the region's roads were of the latter category. This meant that each county assumed the responsibility for surveying, grading, and maintaining a route. In times when heavy equipment was largely lacking, roads remained mostly traces, cutting across the sage plain, fording rivers, or cutting awkwardly around sidehills. Travelers faced miles of difficult travel. The pace was slow and the trials many. In the second decade of the twentieth century the automobile became a major, new force in'the region's transportation. Where steamboats and locomotives had dominated for six decades, the internal combustion engine began a rapid takeover. The advance of automobile and truck traffic, however, was a function of highways. The dropping price of vehicles--a Ford Model T at $440 in 19 15-persuaded thousands that they could shift from horse and buggy to automobile. These events fed the ""good roads movement' and coincided with the remarkable success of the region's first paved highway (Schwantes 1989:29 1). Samuel Hill, visionary and owner of thousands of acres of grasslands in Klickitat County, Washington, dreamed of linking his lands with a highway via the Columbia Gorge. Hill's interests coincided with those of Oregonians who in 1909 began pressing for a new road through the Columbia Gorge. Hill had enticed Samuel C. Lancaster, a wellknown engineer in Tennessee, to move in 1906 to Washington. Simon Benson, a lumberman and philanthropist, shared Hill's interest and in 1912 gave $10,000 toward construction of a portion of such a route. Plans and support unfolded rapidly. Lancaster, who had examined highways 68   in Europe with Hill, secured the job of designing the route. Various fundraising ventures raised the capital and, in spite of opposition, the backers proceeded with construction. A $1.2 million bond issue proved critical and with that the workers laid bitulithic Warrenite .pavement over the route. The Columbia River Highway became the region's first paved, rural roadway upon its opening in 1916 (Fahl 1973:101-l 18). The paved, sea-level highway through the Gorge, as had predecessor developments in transportation, became another turning point in the transportation history of the Columbia Basin. In 1913 the Oregon State Highway Commission commenced its work. Under a new mandate in 19 17, the Commission gained financial responsibility to survey and construct primary and secondary state highways (Fahl 19731136). Oregon in 1919 led the rest of the nation in these efforts with the levying of a gasoline tax to finance road construction. With the slogan ""Lift Oregon Out of the Mud,"" the good roads proponents had resources to get about the task. Washington imposed o gas tax in 1921 and Idaho did so in 1923. The popularity of outomobiles grew unabated. Carlos Schwantes has observed: During the interwor years the region's highway network expanded at a rate never since equaled. During those two decades the mileage of hard-surfaced all-weather roads increased in Idaho and Washington by nearly 300 percent and in Oregon by nearly 250 percent. The Pacific Northwest contained a total of twelve thousand miles of roads in 1940 (Schwantes 1989:291-292). The state road systems consisted of east-west highways with primary north-south routes running along the eastern flank of the Cascades from the Okonogan to ihe Klamath Basin: another from northern Idaho via Moscow and Lewiston to Payette where the route veered southwesterly to Jordan Volley and to McDermitt, Nevada: and a third from Kalispell via the Clark Fork to Butte, then south via Idaho Falls 69   and Pocatello to Ogden, Utah. The east-west routes took on national significance in the 1950s with the construction of l-84 across the Columbia Basin from Portland to the upper Snake watershed and of l-90 from Seattle to Spokane and on to Missoula, Montana. These routes and that of I-1 5, the north-south freeway joining Salt Lake City to Butte Montana proved highly significant in the movement of freight and travelers throughout the Columbia Basin. Interstate haulers of freight and bus passengers, private vehicles, and increasing numbers of tourists found these carefully engineered and maintained roads an efficient way to travel to the far places of the region's interior. While counties and states invested in market roads and highways, the U. S. Forest Service launched its road programs inthe 1920s. The Department of Agriculture identified three road types: ordinary duty, light duty, and motorways. With grades not to exceed ten percent, widths set at nine feet, and turnouts to be at least seventeen feet wide, the system was rudimentary but significant. In 1924 the US Forest Service assessed its road program in the state of Washington: ""Many regions have been opened up by Forest Service roads,"" it noted, ""and when the present plans are completed there will be over 2,000 miles of good roads in the national forests of Washington."" Between 1916 and 1923 the Forest Service in Washington expended $3.3 million in federal funds on roads. The Forest Service also launched a program to mark all stream crossings by name and all crossroads with names or numbers of roads and mileage information. This program evolved from horse-drawn scrapers and hand labor to a full-scale forest highway program following World War II (Mosgrove 1980:139-l 42; U.S. Forest Service 1924). Another aspect of transportation developed with large appropriations to fund the labors of the Army Corps of Engineers. This included the prolonged construction project between 1878 and 1898 to build the canal and locks to bypass the Cascades of the Columbia and 70   the construciion between 1905 and 1915 of the eight and one-half-milelong canal and five locks around Celilo Falls. Subsequent dam and lock projects along the main stem of the Columbia River and the Snake between 1935 and 1965 created an internal waterway system making Lewiston, Idaho, a port and opening a vast region's commerce to use federally-subsidized reservoirs and locks (Willingham 1984). What had served for thousands of years as Indian trails and canoe routes were transformed after 1850 into a complex transportation system. The advent of steam power and corporate investment of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company coincided with the rapid expansion of settlement in the 1860s by livestock raisers and miners. In the 1880s the railroad network began to lace together the region and continued its web of connections through the 1910s. In that decade the good roads movement and popularity of automobiles led to the survey, design, and construction of modern highways. The system grew rapidly to serve the region well by 1940. In the 1950s the investment of federal dollars developed the interstate freeway system OS  well as an extensive forest  road system. When joined with air travel and commuter service to numerous small airports throughout the Columbia Basin, the transportation links tied the interior of the Pacific Northwest to the larger national and world economies.  71   8. Economic Developments The words ""gold and grasslands"" served well to describe the foundational economy of the Columbia Basin. The nearly parallel realizations of the prospect of mineral wealth and the potentials of the region's bunchgrass worked as lodestones to drive the region's first important economic ventures, In time, the diversification of agriculture with the development of wheat, potatoes, and orchard crops gave greater stability and permanence to those who drew their livelihood from the land. The placer deposits played out and yielded to lode mining and capital investments in industrial processing of ores. Once a railroad transportation system was in place, logging and lumbering emerged as new industries. Ultimately manufacturing--including the processing of agricultural commodities--found a hold. The construction of highways furthered tourism and recreation and became yet another player in producing income and sustaining communities. Collectively these ventures over the past century and a half have played lead roles in the economy of the far-flung Columbia watershed. Within that area, however, have been the bread-and-butter ventures of retail sales, banking, real estate, and delivery or professional services. Residents of the region have demanded and received education, medical care, legal assistance, finance and loan programs, and a variety of governmental services. These have ranged from agricultural extension to administration of wildlife refuges and national forests. They have included implementation of federal defense initiatives to building public power projects. To a large extent much of the region's economy has been a direct function of the commitments investments of Congress. Large federal land ownerships in Idaho, Oregon, Montana, and Wyoming have played centrally in the actions of the congressional delegations about when, how, and where to invest resources in public programs. 72   The federal land policy for a century was premised on disposing of the national domain and getting much of it, as fast as possible, into private ownership. The Pre-Emption Act and Donation Land Act had little impact in the Columbia Basin. The Homestead Act, Desert Land Act, Stock-Raising Homesteod Act, and Enlarged Homestead Act, however, enabled thousands of livestock owners and farmers to secure a base from which they then could tap the vast public lands surrounding their holdings. Initially livestock raising offered many attractions. Cattle, horses, and sheep could walk to morket, or, at least to shipping points, from places far distant from railroads or urban areas. The bountiful bunchgrasses which thrived in the oasis settings of the northern Great Basin as well as more than' holding their own in more arid portions of the Snake Plain and Columbia Plateau worked magnetically in the 1860s and the 1870s to draw investors. From initial itinerant herding where the region was perhaps perceived as a vast ""summer pasture,"" there came a quick transition to ranches and farms. The goal of most was to secure a base of operations with dependable water supplies and the ability to cut and store sufficient hay to feed livestock during the winter. If an investor could gain such a base, thousands, or even tens of thousands of acres of surrounding grasslands might then become part of the ""virtual ranch."" Although such properties remained in public ownership, few competitors could work them and survive. Holding the ""base"" created the advantage which has sustained many cattle operations to the presenl day. The advance of the livestock frontier occurred throughout the entire Columbia Basin and northern Great Basin almost simultaneously. The Tenth Federal Census, 1880, included Clarence W. Gordon's ""Report on Cattle, Sheep, and Swine, Supplementary to Enumeration of Live Stock on Farms in 1880."" Gordon addressed lands east of the main stem 73   of the Columbia: The southeast portion of Spokane and Whitman counties, or about one-fifth of `the entire section of the great plain of the Columbia, comprising all that country bordering the Palous river and its tributaries, is, perhaps, the best pasturage of the territory, but is rapidly passing into the possession of farmers. Bunch-grass is here abundant. The middle part of Whitman county along the main Palous and the higher country in the east furnishes superior summer range, from which stock can pass in winter to the milder and drier pastures of western Whitman (Gordon 1883: 1089). The expansion of livestock raising in the 1870s. particularly, included the watersheds of the Harney Basin, Warner Valley, Klamath Basin, Crooked River-Ochoco country in Oregon, the Snake Plain and tributaries such as Raft River and Cassia Creek in Idaho, and the stream courses of the Wenatchee, Methow, Okanogan, and'other rivers draining the eastern slopes of the Cascades in Washington (Oliphant 1968:75-l 14). Cattle have dominated in livestock production throughout the Columbia Basin since the first collection of agricultural data in the Census of 1870. In the 91 counties of the subject area in 1870 the enumerators identified 75,636 head. Twenty years later that figure had multiplied tenfold to 792,501 head. These figures confirmed what the contemporary newspapers noted and what historians of the range industry have assessed. Transcascodia grew dramatically as a livestock area in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The industry continued to thrive, however, and the numbers of cattle doubled again to 1.4 million head by 1910. Four decade later in 1950 the subject area possessed 2.6 million head of cattle. Over the next nineteen years the herds grew by 1969 to 4.1 million head. In 1987 the 91 counties reported 4.3 million head of cattle [Bureau of the Census 18720, 189.50, 19130, 19320, 19520, 19720, 1987). [See Appendix, Agricultural Production: Cattle.]  74   Graph 1.

In the early eighteenth century the Indians of the region obtained horses and rapidly expanded their herds. The Cayuse, Wallo Walla, Umatilla, Palouse, and Nez Perce became famed as horsemen and grew wealthy from the fine stock which thrived on the grasslands in their triboi areas. The Hudson's Bay Company established its horse farm in the 1820s on the lower Walla Walla River. That area became the source of the horses which served Ogden's Snake Country brigades as well as those which worked the coastal region and crossed over the mountains to the Sacramento Valley of California. Horses played an important role in human, transportation until the 1920s. The interior of the Pacific Northwest emerged as a major supplier of horses until they were displaced by automobiles and trucks in the transportation business following World War I. While not as dramatic in production numbers as cattle, horses 75   played an important role for nearly six decades in the Columbia Basin's livestock industry. They numbered 30,382 head in 1870 and grew fourteen-fold to 427,209 head in 1890. Production peaked in 1910 at 683,199 head and dropped steadily. The 1987 agricultural census identified only 143,231 head of horses in the 91 counties (Bureau of the Census 18720, 18950, 19 130. 19320, 19520, 1987).

Producers had 64,342 head in 1870; that figure grew thirtyfive times to 2.3 million head in 1890 and peaked at 6.5 million head in 1910. Sheep continued steady decline after 1930 and numbered 2.6 million in 1950, 1.3 million in 1969, and only 793,014 head in 1987. Undoubtedly the market as well as the impact of the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 and the closing of the public domain to itinerant sheep drovers contributed to the decline of this production in the subject area. dther factors in recent years are the environmental regulations which govern 76   sheep slaughtering facilities. These have discouraged both slaughterhouse operators and sheep raisers (Bureau of the Census 18720, 18950, 19130. 19320, 19520, 19720, 1987). [See Appendix, Agricultural Production: Sheep] Graph 3.

While wool production figures are incomplete (missing for 1910). the sale of wool proved important as it grew from 194,977 pounds in 1870 to 12.8 million pounds in 1890. This production peaked at 44.7 million pounds in 1930 and dropped nearly four-fold to 8.8 million pounds in 1987 (Bureau of the Census 18720, 18950, 19130, 19320, 19520, 19720, 1987).

The 78   figures show the relatively small number of horses compared to sheep and cattle. They also show the steady falling off of sheep and the~rising importance of cattle in the livestock economy of the Columbia Basin. The agricultural component of the economy is mirrored in the number of acres in farms. While all of these acres are not ""improved' or in crop production, they illustrate the dramatic transfer of lands from the public domain to private holdings subsequent to 1890. Indeed in the inter-montane Pacific Northwest the boom years of the Homestead Act were in the period 1910-30. [See Appendix, Land in Farms (acreage)] Graph 6.

The number of acres topped out in the 1960s with 53.9 million acres in 1969 and dropped to 79   52 million acres in 1987 [Bureau of the Census 1872a, 1895a, 1913a, 1932a. 1952a. 1972a. 1987). A bit more problematic but nevertheless useful is the statistical information on the number of irrigated farms. The problem with the data is that it does not identify the number of acres irrigated, only the number of farms. The figures confirm the impact of private and public irrigation projects subsequent to the passage of the Newlands Act in 1902. Graph 7.

Most of the nineteenth century projects, however, were small, often consisting of hond-dug ditches irrigating a bottom land of thirty acres or less. Cooperative ventures and federal projects mounted by the Bureau of Reclamation grew rapidly in the twentieth century. From just over 31,000 farms under irrigation in 1910, the number grew to 58,865 in 1950. While it dropped by nearly 20,000 farms in 1969, 80   that figure probably represents a consolidation of ownerships, not a decline in acres under irrigation (Bureau of the Census 1872a. 18950, 1913a, 19320, 19520, 1987). [See Appendix, Number of Irrigated Farms] The Bureau of the Census through 1910 recorded data on the number of improved acres in farms. These figures provide an interesting check on the data in Graph 6 and reflect o bit more realistically the portions of private holdings under the most intensive agricultural development. The data does not identify whether or not fenced range areas were considered ""improved."" Graph 8.

[See Appendix, Improved Land in farms (Acreage)] The oppendix confirms thot many counties in the subject area lagged in improvements and that of the totals of improved acres in Oregon and Washington, the agricultural regions west 81   of the Cascades were clearly in the lead through 1910. The number of farms in the subject area grew dramatically between 1870 and 1910, slowed, and peaked in 1930. The number of farms then declined and leveled out in the 1960s. These changes confirm the consolidation of ownerships ond a shift to larger holdings. In some instances they document the growth of agri-business or the corporate holdings of farm property. Graph 9.

The figure held at 92,176 in 1950, then declined shorply to 60,031 in 1969. [See Appendix, Number of Farms] The appendix confirms that Idaho, in particular, was a setting for rapid consolidation of ownerships. The number of farms dropped from 40,284 in 1950 to 25,475, a decline of 63% in less than two decades.  82   Graph 10.

In 1890 the average size of farms in Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Washington, and Oregon was 380 acres. This figure increased to 593 acres in 1930, grew to 960 acres per farm in 1950, and grew yet again to 1,463 acres per farm in 1969. [See Appendix, Average Acres Per Farm] The size of farms decreased slightly after 1970 and averaged 1,235 acres in 1987. Eastern Oregon, eastern Washington, and Montana especially have larger farm sizes in modern times than in Idaho (Bureau of the Census 18720, 18950, 1913a. 19320, 1952a, 1987). Cereal crops have bulked large in agricultural production on farms in the subject area. Oats emerged as an early leader in cereals.  83  3   `Graph 1 1.

In 1870 producers reported 464,125 bushels. Twenty years later they reported 2.4 million bushels. That figure expanded tenfold to 24.1 million bushels in 1910. Oats then fell to 8 million bushels in 1'930, 1 1.6 million bushels in 1950, and 4.7 million bushels in 1987. A probable cause in the precipitous decline of oat production was the parallel falling off of raising horses (Bureau of the Census 18720, 1895a, 1913a, 1932a, 19520, 1987). [See Appendix, Agrtcultural Production: Oats (bu)] As oats declined, wheat came into its own as the premier cereal crop of the Columbia Basin. From a modest 362,916 bushels in 1870, production grew to 61.7 million bushels in 19 10. In 1969 it stood at 145 million bushels and in 1987 reached 384 million. The presence of loess soils and ideal weather conditions--intense heat during weeks of long, sunny days--led farmers to invest heavily in the machinery to sew and harvest this crop. They found an ideal wheat belt reaching from Wasco County, Oregon, on the west, across the Plateau to Umatilla County, 84  3   Oregon, ond then running northeast into the high-yield Walla Walla and Palouse region. The presence of rail and river transportation made it possible for wheat producers to sell in a national and international market. [See Appendix, Wheat (bu)]  Graph 12.

The growing importance of cattle raising has fostered a local and regional market for alfalfa since World War II. The advent of irrigation sprinkler systems and the ability to secure three to five cuttings in a season encouraged production of this crop. Alfalfa had a market locally as well as by export on flatbed trucks to feedlots west of the Cascades and in California. Production grew from 2.9 million tons in 1950 to 6.5 million tons in 1990 (Bureau of the Census 18720, 1895a. 19130, 1932a. 1952a. 1987).  86   7000000 T 6000000 soooooo E 4000000 E 3000000  2000000 1000000 0  1870  1890  1910  1930  1950  1970  1987  (Bureau of the Census 1872a, 1895a. 19130, 19320, 1952a. 1987)  Click here to view Graphs 14 and 15  Graph 15.

[See appendix, Agricultural Production: Potatoes (bu)]. The eastern slopes of the Cascades in Washington proved remarkably well-suited for orchards. The Yakima, Wenatchee, and Okanogan watersheds, in fact, gained fame for their fruit crops. Apples have led in this industry as it has emerged since 1930. Production grew tenfold from 3.3 million bushels in 1910 to 32.4 million in 1930.

(Bureau of the Census 18720, 18950, 19130, 19320, 19520, 1987)  In the nineteenth century the connections between mining and agriculture were initially symbiotic. The discovery of minerals--particularly gold and silver--initiated rushes of population to far-flung parts of the Columbia Basin. Miners by the hundreds, and sometimes the thousands, poured into the diggings on the upper John Day, the Blue Mountains, Boise Basin, upper Salmon River, Clearwater region, upper Owyhee, ond the Coeur d'Alenes. This hungry population was focused on a singular goal of extracting ores. By necessity they stimulated stock-raising, cereal crop production, and planting of vegetables and orchards. The mining population generated a local market, albeit often transitory, for the produce of those engaged in agriculture. Statistical information about the yield of mineral deposits in the project area is frustratingly incomplete. Part of the problem is that the yeors of initial and presumably big yields predated maintenance of accurate assay records. Thus the longer term assessment of overall production is, at best, hypothetical. Mining, however, proved significant in several ways. It stimulated the spread of settlement. It fostered a9   agriculture. It generated a disposable export. A partial picture of the impact of mining and then flow of gold and silver out of the Columbia watershed, most of it originating in the project area, were shipment figures of Wells-Fargo Co. and the Ladd and Tilton Bank of Portland, Oregon. Table 3. Gold and Silver Shipments from Portland, Oregon, 1864-1870 Year 1864 1865 1866 1867 1868 1869 1870 (Brooks and Ramp 1968:9) The flow of mineral wealth through Portland provides a fair measure on the importance of the mines of eastern Oregon and, most particularly, Idaho, for the 1860s were a period of boom production in that territory. The initial production was almost entirely placer gold. Following the discoveries of Elias Davidson Pierce, in 1860, the Clearwater district yielded an estimated $3.4 million by 1866 before dropping off to less than $70,000 per year by the 1870s. The Salmon River mines produced on estimated $9.6 million between 1862 and 1867, while the Boise Basin (an area of 250 square miles) yielded by 1866 on estimated $24 million (Greever 1963:257-266: Throckmorton 1961:247-263). Illustrative of the impact of mining was production in Oregon. Between 1852 and 1964 Oregon produced an estimated 5.7 million 90 I Gold and Silver $6.200.000 $5.800.000 $5,400,000 $4.000.000 $3.677,850 $2.979.137 $1.797.800 $29.843.787  Total   ounces of gold and 5.4 million ounces of silver volued ot nearly $136 million. Approximately 73% of the production come from the mines of Baker ond Grant counties. If the Malheur, Wallowa, ond Union county mines were added in, it is reosonable to conclude that at least 80% of the production of these two minerals in Oregon come from the Columbia watershed. In the period 1902-65 Baker County produced 75% of the total gold mined in Oregon (Brooks ond Romp 1968:7-8). The introduction of new technologies and opening of lode deposits renewed mining in the lost two decodes of the nineteenth century. Highly significant in this renewal os'the opening of the mines in the Coeur d'Alene district ninety miles eost of Spokane. Shoshone County in 1890 hod 3,993 residents and produced an estimated $10 million in ore thot year. The advent of industrial mining, however, WQS noteworthy in Idaho for the lobor strife ond violence which pitted union workers against obsentee owners, mine monogers, ond private armies. Strikes, lockouts, murders, bombings, ond imprisonments catapulted the mines of northern ldoho into notorious prominence in the 1890s (Greever 1963:274-282). Toble 4. ldoho Miners, 1870-1930 1870 5,579 1880 4,708 1890 5,200 1900 4,089 1910 2,971 1920 1,898 1930 981  (Schwantes 1989:253) Mining' remoined Q problematic, extractive industry throughout the twentieth century. Miners ond mine owners were beset by world competition, set values of gold and silver, notional fiscal policy, ond 91   finally by environmental regulations over woter, oir, and dange:ous mineral releoses from both shofts and processing facilities. After CI century of operation the Bunker Hill Mine and smelter closed in 1981 ot Kellogg, Idaho. Fewer than 400 miners remained ot work in the distrtct which hod once sustoined thousonds (Schwontes 1989:349). With vast stands of timber on the eastern slopes of the Cascades ond the Bitterroots ond Rockies, the Columbia Basin possessed a third noturol resource--beyond ogriculturol lands ond minerols--that beckoned to investors. Timber, however, took many on a roller coaster of fortune and misfortune. The industry proved heavily responsive to nationol trends in the economy, subject to sharp downturns when building starts dropped off or mortgage rates pushed too high, ond vulnerable to freight rates. From the yeors of initiol settlement in the 1860s into the mid-1880s, most of the logging ond lumbering served only local markets. The row material ond finished product were too heavy to haul to compete even in regional construction. This situation begun to change with the completion of the Northern Pacific Roilroad in 1883 and the advance of the Oregon Roilway ond Novigotion Compony's line eastword to the Blue Mountains ond southeast vio the Oregon Short Line to connect with the Central Pacific. The railroads, indeed, provided a major stimulus to the lumber industry. Their construction created on important market for ties, trestle materiols, and finished lumber for worehouses, depots, and dwellings for workers. In 1883 the Montono Improvement Company secured o twenty-yeor contract with the Northern Pacific to supply oil of its needs for forest products from The Dalles to Miles City, Montana, ond, as port of the agreement, would receiver preferential shipping rates for its lumber on the roilrood (Cox 1974:20 l-202). The impact of the roilroad clearly helped drive the region's forest products business. From 18 million board feet of cut in 1880, production 92   in Idaho rose by 1890 to 31 million boord feet. A writer for the Wed Shore in 1880 described the Cleorwoter River OS  o ""flouting woodyard,""  for logs filled the stream for dozens of miles. The log drives of the 1880s. in fact, established a system of transportation which persisted on the Clearwater for the next eighty yeors ond were curtoiled on the North Fork only with the building of Dworshok Dam. By the lute 1880s the mills in the Blue Mountoins in Oregon and southeast Woshington were cutting up to 30 million board feet per year. Similarly the Palouse River became the setting for log drives. Workmen moved on estimated 4 million feet down stream to Colfox and Polouse City each year (Cox 1974:202). The rise of logging and lumbering wos also a function of the mineral discoveries and the need for shoring timbers, construction materials for smelters, and the boords to build housing and towns near the mine portals. Similarly, the influx of settlers engaged in forming created local markets for forest products. Spokane, Washington, become one of the important regional manufacturing centers which met these needs. In 1888 the Spokone Mill Company produced 15 million feet of lumber, 6,000 doors. ond 10.000 windows. The following year Spokone hod nine mills which cut on estimoted 30 million feet of lumber valued at $2.2 million. Loggers supplied these plants by driven timber down the St. Joe, St. Mories, ond Coeur d'Alene rivers where they were rofted across Lake Coeur d'Alene (Kensel 1968:25). Subsequent to 1900 the fall of production from the forests of the upper Midwest persuaded capitalists to move their enterprises ond employees to new regions. The northern Columbia Basin become a primary target for these activities. A scramble commenced for timberlonds (Space 1974:2-5). lllustrotive of what hoppened was construction in 1901 of the J. A. Humbird and Frederick Weyerhoeuser sowmill at Sondpoint, Idoho, and that of Michigan lumbermen at Hope on Lake Pend Oreille. In 1905 Weyerhaeuser and Wisconsin industrialists 93   constructed the large mill at Potlatch, Idaho, and J. P. McGoldrick of Minneapolis bought out the Fox Lumber Company of Spokane to transform its mill into the largest in that city. Idaho cut in 1899 65 million feet of lumber. In 1910 Idaho produced 745 million feet of lumber. Its markets had shifted from local to national. The railroads enabled mill owners to supply and compete favorably in the Dakotas, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Iowa, Colorado and other states (Kensel 1968:26-27). The pine forests of the trans-montane region provided ideal materials for boxes and barrels. Their manufacture emerged in the early 1900s as an ideal complement to success of orchards and shipment of fruit to distant markets. Of lesser importance was pulp and paper manufacturing. Driving by the Kraft process, discovered in 1909, the pulp industry had far wider impact in western Washington and Oregon, though by the mid-twentieth century the forests of the interior yielded a steady supply of wood fiber shipped by rail and barge to pulp facilities west of the Gorge (Schwontes 1989:177-l 78). Employment data in the logging and lumbering industry for Idaho shows the growth of those enterprises in the eorly twentieth century: Table 5. Idaho Loggers, Raftersand Sawmill Workers, 1870-1930 1880 1890 1900 1910 1920 1930  Loggers and Rafters: 224 373 701 2,246 5,217 4,910  Sawmill Workers: 100 237 349 2,469 2,904 4,296  (Schwantes 1989:253)  94   The close relationship between natural resources and economic activity is clearly evident in the inter-montane Pacific Northwest. The big three--agriculture, mining, and logging and lumbering--have figured centrally in the health and wealth of the Columbia Basin. E. R. Jackman, wrote cogently of the connections: Population of a valley, a state, or a region, depends directly upon the primary income. in the West, that income is usually from farming and harvesting of timber. The town that has both is in a better position than the town with just one. The money poured into the town from farms and forests supports the lawyers, doctors, grocev stores, hairdressers, service stations, and all of the other dozens of occupations. The valley that produces yearly $20,000.000 from these two primary sources will normally have twice the population of the one with $10.000.000 (Simpson and Jackman 1967:334-335). The emergence of towns and cities and the delivery of goods and services which they performed is another important element in the economy of the Columbia Basin. The project area, however, is noteworthy for the its lack of mojor cities. The few are Boise, Spokane, Walla Walla, and the Tri-Cities--Pasco, Kennewick, and Richland. Boise and Walla Walla had their genesis during the initial settlement of the 1850s and the 1860s. Both served as important distribution points for goods and services to scattered populations in the regions wherein they lay. Spokane was more a creation of the Northern Pacific Railroad than the falls which initially drew investors to construct mills. Spokane grew dramatically after 1883 as additional railroads built in the region and it became a center for shipping, banking, and other services (Kensel 1968:25-3 1). The Tri-Cities emerged in 1942 as a secret, federal initiative. The Manhattan Project involved three areas of the United States: Mussel 95   Shoals, Tennessee, Los Alamos, New Mexico, and Richland, Washington. Each was involved in the covert action to produce materials for the manufacture and detonation of the atomic bomb. As tens of millions of federal dollars poured in, construction projects and jobs related to this project attracted thousands of workers to the Hanford Nuclear Reservation near the confluence of the Yakima and Columbia rivers. The federal investments involved securing 670 square miles, relocating 1,500 residents, and, in time, building a series of nuclear reactors and extensive research laboratories (Schwantes 1989:326-327). The federal government exercised significant impacts on the Columbia Basin's logging and lumbering industry through its management of national forests. The Forest Reserve Act of 1891 set the stage for a succession of executive withdrawgls for watershed and other purposes. In time these designations included millions of acres of timber lands in the mountainous portions of the Columbia Basin. Most dramatic were the ""Midnight Reserves,"" a series of executive orders in 1907 of Theodore Roosevelt. A Forest Service appropriation bill that year carried a rider barring the president from creating further reserves in several western states, Prior to signing the legislation President Roosevelt withdrew 16 million acres. By 1907 the land in national forests included five-sevenths of Idaho's standing timber as well as one-fourth of that in Oregon and one-fifth in Washington (Johansen and Gates 1967:542-543: Runte 199 1:56; Steen 199 1). The federal government also seriously affected the range industries through its implementation of gr,azing restrictions, protection of watershed, and allocation of allotments within the forest reserves. Much of the impetus for these regulations came from Frederic V. Colville's influential Forest Growth and Sheep Grazing in fhe Cascade Mountains of Oregon (1898). Colville's recommendations led to an allocation and permit system whereby stockraisers secured grazing rights within bounds 96   of regulations set by the U.S. Forest Service. The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 brought range regulation to 142 million acres in eleven western states. This law created Grazing Districts ond put the U.S. Grazing Service, a predecessor to the Bureau of Land Management, in charge of improving and administering both the allotments' and conditions on the public domain (Beckham 1984~). Many in the Pacific Northwest viewed these ""conservation"" programs narrowly and voiced their criticism. They argued that ""locking up"" tens of millions of acres of timber and rangeland was a disservice to local communities and the regional economy. They also argued against further protection of watersheds and conservation of natural resources OS  unnecessary and unwise. The Clarke-McNary Act (1924) stressed The McSweeney-McNary Act (1928) represented a partial  conservation but called for the ""continuous production of timber"" on federal lands. solution. The law funded forest experiment stations and research programs to balance conservation and harvesting. Ultimately the U.S. Forest Service, bowing to intense pressure for military needs during and after Wold War II, moved from conservation to harvesting of the federal lands. ""Getting out the cut' became a mark of a good timber manager as the rush to higher and higher production of forest products drove prosperous local economies and created hundreds of jobs of engineers and silvaculturalists in the Forest Service (Johansen and Gates 1968:454549). Throughout the inter-montane interior of the Pacific Northwest the region's economy has responded to the presence and programs of the federal government. Reclamation projects--including the massive Grande Coulee Dam, the Owyhee Dam, and hundreds of miles of, canals--have had immense consequences on construction employment and agriculture. Hydropower projects have dammed the once mighty Columbia, Snake, Clearwater and smaller tributaries and generated a 97   steady flow of relatively inexpensive electricity which has powered the aluminum industry and improved standards of living through the region. Defense spending has during wartime created facilities such as Camp Farrogut, Camp Abbot, the Hermiston Army Depot, and Yokima Bombing Range. The Navy, Army, and Air Force have all helped stimulate and sustain the local economies of the region. Collectively the federal government, in its massive holding of lands and multiple agency programs, has contributed to the course and direction of the economic well-being of the Columbia Basin. The Columbia Basin has since World War II lured many recreation seekers. Some have come to camp, hike, fish, and hunt. While national forests and BLM wilderness areas are major magnets, the North Cascades National Park and Hells Conyon National Recreation Area are specially managed areas. Heritage tourism sites include the Whitman Mission and Nez Perce National Monument, administered by the National Park Service, the National Historic Oregon Trail Interpretive Center at Flagstaff Hill, administered by the Bureau of Land Management, and the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, administered by the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service. These federal holdings, state parks, and private ventures which include jet boats, raft trips, dude ranches, and horseback outings add important, seasonal revenues to the economy. In spite of diversification, however, the Columbia Basin has retained agriculture, forest products, and federal government projects as its most important economic enterprises. These emerged during the first four decades of settlement and, except for the early stimulus of mining, have remained fairly consistent the region's economy.  98   9. Federal Projects The imprint of Uncle Sam rests heavily across the American West and particularly in the Basin and Plateau sections of the Pacific Slope. Federal ownership runs from fifty to nearly eight percent of the land. The history of those londs is a record of inaction, action in response to ""pork barrel"" legislation, management in light of changing mandates and special interests, and a mixed legacy of development and stewardship. The story is incompletely assessed and is yet unfolding. Bureau of Indian Affairs The Bureau of Indian Affairs was one of the first arms of the federal government to develop program activities in the Columbia Basin. Its initial activities commenced in 1842 when Dr. Elijah White secured appointment as Indian Agent for Oregon Territory. The position was anomalous in that American sovereignty had not yet been established in the region. Nevertheless White drew up a low code for the Nez Perce and also ottempted to quell the anxieties of the Walla Walla and Cayuse about the trespass of Oregon Trail emigrants. White departed in 1845 (Washburn 1988696). Joseph Lane, first territorial governor, olso served as ex-officio Superintendent of Indian Affairs. In 1851 .the Interior Department established the traditional system of civilian superintendents, agents and sub-agents. With the negotiation of treaties, 1853-68, the government began its program of removals and consolidation of native peoples on reservations. For the next century the role of the BIA was to promulgate ""civilization"" programs and to serve as trustee for Indian lands and assets. To drive the process of assimilation, the Bureau established on-reservation day schools and boarding schools, ond regional, off-reservation boarding schools. Indian students from the Columbia watershed thus  99   often journeyed to sites far removed from their homelands and fomilies to attend Cushman Indian School (Tacoma, WA.), Chemawa Indian School (Salem, OR.), Greenville or Riverside Schools (Fresno and Riverside, CA.), Haskell Institute (Lawrence, KS.), or Carlisle Indian School (Carlisle, PA.). The BIA promoted agriculture, even on arid lands, and implemented the General Allotment Act (1887). It divided up reservations into individually-held trust parcels or, in the case of the Northern Paiute of the Harney Basin, apportioned over 10,000 acres in public domain trust allotments (Ruby and Brown 1981:174-184; Buan and Lewis 1991:73). Throughout the century between 1850 and 1950 the federal government permitted and approved inroads on the Indian reservations. Congress repeatedly granted rights-of-way for railroad and wagon roads through Indian lands (Kappler 1904). The BIA Division of Forestry helped mark and sell reservation timber for logging and manufacturing by offreservation timber companies. The BIA administered grazing leases which permitted non-Indians to run livestock on the reservations. The BIA also extended health care to enrolled tribal members, an activity which after World War II passed to the Indian Health Service and ultimately lodged in the Department of Health and Human Services. The BIA also approved attorney contracts and administered tribal judgment funds secured by tribes in litigation before the U.S. Claims Court and the Indian Claims Commission. Since the 1960s the BIA has assisted tribes in developing reservation economies. These activities have included business planning, loans for business start-ups, and programs to train tribal members to find and secure jobs. The BIA has provided technical services to tribes and assisted them in finding joint-venture partners for mining, logging, lumbering, and recreation development (Bureau of Indian Affairs 1981). In the 1990s the BIA role has diminished. Increasingly tribes have 100   taken charge of their own contracting and program administration. This has been driven to a large degree by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, P.L. 93-638 (1975) and most recently by the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project (1992) and the Tribal SelfGovernance Act (1994). The Confederated Tribes of Salish & Kootenai, Pablo. Montana, were the first in the Columbia watershed to enter the Self-Governance Demonstration Project (Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project 1992). General land Office The General Land Office commenced its operations in Oregon Territory in 1851. tts mission was to survey and dispose of the public domain in an orderly manner. John B. Preston, first surveyor-general, established the Baseline and the Willamette Meridian. From that contract surveyors mounted subdivisions of townships eastward to the Snake River (Cozier 1976:76-80: White 1982:l 14). The act of March 3, 1863, which created Idaho Territory did not call for land surveys. In 1864, however, Congress placed Idaho under the Colorado surveying district and, in time, the surveys commenced based on the Boise Meridian (White 1982:133). The General Lond Office was thus charged to layout the land in an orderly manner so that disposition might take place with a minimum of dispute and contention. It functioned as the all-important place for filing on Homesteads and other entries on public lands as well as a sales office for cash entry purchases. The General Land Office also played an early role in administration of forest withdrawals in the Columbia Basin. Congress in 1891 authorized the President to withdraw lands from the public domain as Forest Reserves. These were surveyed and assessed for their standing timber and condition by the U.S. Geological Survey and administered by the General Land Office. In reolity, these were ""paper reserves"" since the 101   GLO had no on-the-ground personnel until 1898 to protect the properties from trespass or to fight fires. Congress relieved the General Land Office of forestry management in 1905 (Williams n.d.a:l). Army Corps of Engineers The roles of the Army Corps throughout the Columbia Basin have varied over time. Created in 1802, the Corps was initially charged with engineering and planning public works. In 1824 Congress assigned waterway improvements to the agency. From 1838 to 1863 a separate Corps of Topographical Engineers mounted special surveys across the American West. Lt. John C. Fremont of the Topographical Engineers in 1843 brought his party into the Snake and Columbia watersheds to explore and map the Oregon Trail. Following the merger of these two entities the Corps concentrated on military fortifications and civil works projects. In 1871 the Corps created an Engineer Office in Portland, Oregon, to expand an ambitious waterway improvement program throughout the Pacific Northwest. It opened a separate Engineer Office in Seattle in 1896 (Willingham 1992:~). The Topographical Engineers provided special assistance to the Office of Pacific Railroad Explorations and Survey between 1853 and 1855. It also mounted the survey of the Fort Vancouver-Fort Dalles and the Fort Steilacoom-Fort Walla Walla military wagon roads. Congress funded these projects between 1853 and 1855. They were administered by the Pacific Military Wagon Road Office in San Francisco. The Topographical Engineers also wrote several rep&-is about conditions and prospects of the interior of the Pacific Northwest. These included, for example, Lt. George H. Mendell's `Topographical Memoir of the Country from Fort Dalles to Fort Boise"" (Jackson 1952). Some of the most important work of the Corps of Engineers, developed, however, in its river surveys and programs to improve 102   navigation in the Columbia and its tributaries. Lt. William Heurer commenced work at the John Day Rapids in 1867-68 to remove rock obstructions. In the mid-1870s Major Nathaniel Michler worked on a master plan for river transportation from Astoria to Lewiston. The project included mapping obstructions and assessing bypass actions or facilities. The Corps estimated that with canals and locks at the Cascades and Celilo, a mere $150,000 more would open the way from the mouth of, the Deschutes to the mouth of the Cleat-water. The Corps designed the complex Cascades Canal with locks and let contracts in 1878. The project endured numerous cost overruns and years of labor and was not completed until 1896 (Willingham 1983:27-36). In 1881 Lt. Thomas W. Symons mounted an important survey of the Columbia from the mouth of the Snake to the Canadian boundary. Symons wrote a long, nalTotive report and mapped obstructions for future Corps projects (Willingham 1983:50). On the lower Snake the Corps of Engineers constructed a government scow with crew quarters and drilling platform. This went into use for drtlling and blasting rocks from the river. The work proved perilous, especially when working at low water during freezing winter conditions. Explosions and drownings killed at least fifteen workers. By 1890, however, the projects had opened more than 70 miles of the lower Snake to regular steamboat transportation. The Corps also identified and mounted projects on the Columbia, including removing obstructions at Prtest Rapids. These projects opened the river to steamboat use as far as the mouth of the Okanogan by 1887 (Willingham 1992:25-28). The Corps' upper Columbia projects commenced in 1890 and continued until 1917. While railroads laced the region, some residents yet argued for federal river improvements to make transportation more price competitive. The Corps mounted projects to blast rocks and improve channels at Priest Rapids, Rock Island Rapids, Cabinet Rapids 103   and Entiat Rapids. In some places the engineers designed a system of ringbolts to permit steamboats to winch their way upstream through the swift waters. In 1908 Eugene Ricksecker mounted a new Columbia River survey from Bridgeport to Grand Rapids just below Kettle Falls. The recommendations brought funding and a project in 191 1 to remove rocks and improve the channel. The Corps did not pursue further the efforts of some upper Columbia residents to build locks and canals for navigation to Kettle Falls or to the Canadian border (Willingham 1992:6770). Other parts of the Columbia Basin were also targeted by the Corps of Engineers. In the years 1899-1910 the Corps removed materfals form the Pend O'Reille River in Idaho and Washington. It also carried out snag removal on 27 miles of the Flathead River, removing rocks in Flathead Lake, and improvements for some 60 miles along the Kootenai River in Montana (Willingham 1992:72-73). A turning point came in the 1920s for the Columbia River Basin in federal water projects. A combination of local and state initiatives-many of them driven by an interest in irrigation--led Congress to pass the River and Harbor Act of 1925 which directed the Corps of Engineers and the Federal Power Commission to study navigable streams `whereon power development appear feasible and practicable."" The agencies were instructed to draw up plans for those rivers to develop water power, harness floods, and provide for irrigation. In 1926 the House of Representative received the ""308 report' which assessed ten river basins. The Columbia featured prominently in the study and appeared feasible for major federal projects. The ""308 report"" contained 1,845 pages and addressed projects and costs for navigation, power, imgation, and flood control. The plan called for ten dams on the Columbia. Grand Coulee would check the upper river and create a massive irrigation project. Bonneville would close the lower river and facilitate the first part of 104   extensive navigation system. The ""308 report"" became the blueprint for nearly 40 years of major federal river projects in the Columbia Basin (Willingham 1983:93-95). The interest of the nation in harnessing the power of the Columbia coincided with efforts by the New Deal administration to attempt to solve the crisis in the economy. The Bonneville and Grand Coulee Dam projects appeared ideal. They would provide jobs, lay the foundation for revived and new regional manufacturing, generate the power to pour irrigation water over an area at least the size of Rhode Island, and check the annual floods of the Columbia. The ""308 report"" projects coincided with the New Deal commitment to ""Relief, Recovery, and Reform."" The Bonneville project commenced in 1933 and included a dam, massive power house, locks, and fish ladders. The backpool reached 48 miles upstream to The Dalles and could accommodate, with the locks, large tugs. barges. and even small, ocean-going passenger vessels. The powerhouse was designed to hold two turbines but had the potential to house eight more. More than 4,000 workers labored on the projects at Bonneville. In September, 1937, President Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicated the dam (Willingham 1987). In 1861 Capt. Leonard White risked lives and property to run the Colonel Wright, a steamboat, up the lower Snake to Lewiston. That event ""proved"" to succeeding generations that the river was navigable and, for many years. the Spray, Cacadillo, Tenino, and other vessels supplied Lewiston by dodging the rocks and rapids of the river. Although mineral production soon faded, the spread of wheat farming and need of those producers to ship their harvests to market rekindled the interest in improving navigation on the lower Snake. Decades passed, however, before a reluctant Corps of Engineers and Congress authorized a series of dams and locks to transform Lewiston-Clarkston into a port connected   directly to the North Pacific via the Snake and Columbia iivers. Study followed study until finally at the end of World War II Congress approved construction of four dams on the lower Snake. To manage this volume of new work the Corps created the Walla Walla District and in late 1948 it took over the projects. The Corps constructed Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose, and Lower Granite dams. It anticipated building Asotin, Nez Perce, and High Mountain Sheep dams flooding major portions of Hells Canyon, Public pressure persuaded congress to abrogate that planning and set aside the region in 1975 as the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (Petersen and Reed 1994:73, 89-146, 187-190). Federal Power Commission As a licensing agency, the Federal Power Commission has directfy and indirectly exercised a significant impact on the development of the Columbia Basin. Its review of reports prepared by the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, its work with private utility companies in reserving power sites and building facilities, and its coordination of development of the network of power distribution lines have made it a key if often low vlsrbllrty, player.

Table 6 includes major private or public utility company projects operating under Federal Energy Commission licenses on the Columbia and its major tributaries. Collectively these river projects have shaped modern transportation systems, provided irrigation Water for major alterations of the Columbia Plateau ond Snake Plain 107   envircnments. and generated electricity to light homes and businesses, and power industry. U.S. Army and Navy Both the Army and Navy have constructed facilities and maintained personnel in the Columbia watershed. At times their activities have played highly important roles in the local economies, in development of facilities, and in maintenance of national defense. In the 19th century the Army established military posts throughout the region. Its important supply and command locations were Fort Dalles, Oregon, and Fort Walla Walla. Washington. The Army assigned troops to guard duty on or adjacent to Indian reservations, These posts included Fort Simcoe, Fort Harney, and Fort Klamath. As the result of Indian hostilities between 1850 and 1877 the Army established shorter term posts throughout the region. These included Fort Boise. Idaho, Camp Warner, Oregon, and Fort Taylor, Washington (Bancroft 1890). The period of most significant military build up and expenditure in the region occurred during and following World War II. In 1942 the U. S. Navy established Camp Farragut at Lake Pend Oreille. It became in that decade the largest city in Idaho and the second largest military training facility in the United States. During the war the U. S. Army erected Camp Abbot on the Deschutes near Bend, Oregon. This fort trained recruits for military service. The U.S. Army also developed the Umatilla Army Depot, a facility with hundreds of underground storage bunkers for chemical weapons and armament storage, and the Yakima Bombing Range. Nearby the Army secured a 670 square-mile area just upstream from the confluence of the Yakima and Columbia rivers, moved out 4,500 residents, and in 1943 began construction of facilities to produce plutonium for atomic weapons. The secret Hanford Project drew in 45,000 workers and led to a population boom in nearby 108   Richland, Pasco, and Kennewick. The Cold War led to continuing federal investments in reactors and laboratories at Hanford. Today the efforts to clean up the accumulated radioactive wastes yet feed the economy of southeastern Washington. Although.all reactors are closed or off-line, federal expenditures continue at this site (Schwantes 1989:326327, 379-380). Bureau of Reclamation The arid interfor of the Pacific Northwest is an anomalous region. The Snake Plain and Columbia Plateau are essentially a great sagebrush and bunchgrass steppe, yet bisecting them are numerous rivers. The challenge for agriculturalists was to find a way to get the vast volumes of water from the canyons to the potentially fertile mesas above. Uncle Sam was to play an important role in that enterprtse. In 1902 Congress passed the Newlands Act. The legislation proposed that the federal government would make major irrigation improvements, would design each project to provide maximum benefits to the entire area, and would self-liquidate the costs incurred. The law called for the eventual turn over of the projects and their management to the users. The U.S. Reclamation Service (the Bureau of Reclamation since 1923) was to administer the Reclamation Fund and mount the improvements--dams, canals, siphons, and other distribution systems. Revenues from the sale of public lands in thirteen western states and four territories funded the Reclamation Fund. By 1903 $5.8 million was available for projects in Idaho, Washington, and Oregon (Johansen and Gates 1967:382-393). In several places--the Deschutes, Yakima, Klamath Basin, Harney Basin--private irrigation initiatives of Carey Act (1894) projects had already taken the best locations. The Carey Act provided for the transfer of federal lands to sates if the states contracted with commercial companies or individuals for their irrigation. In Idaho the law 109   worked well. The Twin Falls South Side project covered 240,000 acres and was one of the largest. By 1917 over 868,000 acres in Idaho were included in Carey Act projects and of that 456,000 acres were in production (Johansen and Gates 1967:388-389). The projects under the Newlands Act included the Umatilla and Klamath projects in Oregon, the Boise-Payette project in Idaho, and the Yakima and Okanogan projects in Washington. The Reclamation Service by 1909 had brought 125,000 acres under inigation. In time the federal agency built numerous dams, canals, and dftches. The reservoirs and river diversions turned much arid land into production. The elaborate Lost River Project eventually irrigated 187,000 acres in the Klamath Basin. The Yakima project was designed to irrigate 450,000 acres. These initiatives also led to the Minidoka project in the Boise Basin (Johansen and Gates 19671393-398). The federal planning, engineering, and outlays for irrigation brought tens of thousands of acres of the upper Snake watershed into agrtcultural production in the early twentieth century. High on the priority list were the lands of the Payette and Boise valleys. The U.S. Geological Survey mounted initial studies; these were then refined and expanded by the Bureau of Reclamation to include a storage reservoir on the Boise River, another series of three at Deer Flat, diversion works on both rivers, and extensive distributing canals. The Boise-Payette project was illustrative of the important teamwork between local interests and federal investments of engineers and money to make projects happen (Peebles 1969:16-31). Grand Coulee Dam and its related irrigation systems became the most massive of all projects mounted by the Bureau of Reclamation in the Pacific Northwest. Funded as another New Deal program, construction commenced at Grand Coulee in 1934 and continued until 1941. The plan was to dam the Columbia, generate electricity, and 110   power twelve massive pumps to raise water from Roosevelt Lake to the sagebrush plain. The distribution system did not start water deliveries until 1951. By the mid-l 980s the Grand Coulee project irrigated 540,000 acres, serving 6,000 farms producing 60 different crops (Schwantes 1989:3oaj. U.S. Forest Service The creation for Forest Reserves commenced in the Columbia Basin in 1892 with the east-draining sections of the forest withdrawal which, in time, became Mount Rainier National Park. Additional acreage passed in 1893 into the Cascade Range Forest Reserve created by Grover Cleveland. In 1897 Cleveland proclaimed 13 new reserves in the American West. These included the Priest River withdrawal of 645,120 acres in Idaho. Many opponents criticized these decisions, alleging that the federal government was locking up valuable resources needed by miners, sawmill owners, sheep and cattle grazers, and others. The Pettigrew Amendment of 1897 stipulated that any future withdrawals could be made only for watershed protection and timber production. Between 1904 and 1906 the federal government renewed withdrawals for national forests. These included Baker City, .Blue Mountains, Chesnimnus. Fremont. Goose Lake, Heppner, Maury Mountain, and Wallowa in Oregon and the Wenaha which lay in Oregon and Washington. In 1907 Representative Charles W. Fulton of Oregon introduced an amendment to prohibit further forest withdrawals by executive order in the Pacific Northwest. In the days before the new law came into effect President Theodore Roosevelt made the infamous ""midnight reserves."" He set aside 16 million acres, including the Blue Mountains, Coville, and lmnaha national forests (Runte 1991:55-56; Williams n.d.b:l). The implementation of management in the national forests 111   evolved gradually and was based upon a series of classification projects assessing standing timber volumes, species, and condition as well as special reports. These were permissible with congressional approval in 1897 of the Organic Act for the Division of Forestry. In 1898, for example. Frederick V. Colville. produced the influential Bulletin No. 15, Foresf Growth and Sheep Grating in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, based on a previous season of field examination. Colville called for a new system of regulations--closing some areas entirely, issuing grazing allotments on a permit basis, collecting fees, and securing cooperation with local growers' associations (Colville 1898). In 1905 the Forest Reserves were transferred from the General Land Office to the Bureau of Forestry in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Forest Service was created on July 1, 1905, to manage those lands which, in 1907, were henceforth identified as national forests and no' longer as ""reserves."" The challenges to the limited staff were numerous. They included surveying and marking boundaries, assessing timber volumes, mounting fire protection and fire fighting programs, building trails, and establishing working relationships with residents who lived adjacent to the forests. The Forest Service personnel had to cope with trespass, theft, hostility from those who opposed the creation of the vast withdrawals from public entry, isolation, and absence of even the most rudimentary infrastructure for carrying out their tasks. They lacked lookouts, guard stations, drift fences, telephone lines, trails,. bridges, and other basic improvements which would contribute to doing their tasks. The years 1907-33 were thus ones of modest but steady steps. Construction of trails, shelters, and lookouts, fire-fighting, and grazing monitoring occupied the energies of the limited staff (Williams n.d.b:3-4: Steen 199 1:34-35). The years 1933-45 proved highly significant for the national forests of the Columbia River watershed. The Civilian Conservation Corps, 112   established in 1933 as a ""make-work"" initiative of the New Deal, placed tens of thousands of young men on the lands administered by the Forest Service. These workers constructed comals. drift fences, roads, trails, guard stations, ranger stations, reservoirs, cattle guards, lookouts, campgrounds, and telephone lines. They fought fires, planted trees, eradicated insects, collected seedlings, worked on stand improvement, and laobred in nurseries. Their work laid the basis for a much expanded recreational use and management of the forests. In Oregon the CCC employed a total of 86,775 men with an average of 51 camps per year; in Washington 73,339 men served with an average of 43 camps per year, In the two states the combined outlays were $164.3 million far the programs. To a much lesser extent the CCC labors continued from 1942 until 1945 (and in some instances longer) by the conscientious objectors during World War II who were held at former CCC camps. .The ""conchies"" worked in reforestation and fire fighting when other men were away in military service. The Aircraft Warning Stations, estoblished .in 1942, employed many women to staff fire lookouts and monitor the skies for passing aircraft (Throop 1979; Williams n.d.b:4, n.d.c:3-10; Williams 1986). Subsequent to World War II the Forest Service shifted from a largely custodial management to opening forested areas for logging, recreation, and silvaculture. Humans, not nature, took control of removing and restacking the forests. The Forest Pest Control Act of 1947 activated initiatives in the forests of the Columbia Basin beset by insect infestation. By the 1960s the forests were perceived as under ""multipleuse."" Local economies tapped heavily into the cutting and manufacturing of forest products harvested in the national forests. The Forest Service grew rapidly in personnel, swelling its ranks with engineers to design roads and bridges, workers to maintain a rapidly expanding road and highway system, and clerical and accounting staff to process 113   the paper associated with cruises, timber sales, and reforestation activities. The Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act of 1960 became a benchmark in the unfolding programs (Wiliams n.d.b:5). The Forest service also was heavily impacted by other initiatives approved by Congress. These included the Wilderness Act of 1964, the wilderness review process (later called RARE I) which commenced in 1972, the Wild ond Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and the creation in 1975 of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Areo under Forest Service administration. These meosures and increased public awareness that the national forests belonged to all the people of the United States--not just those residing nearby--vastly complicated the roles of planning and public process for the Forest Service. The Youth Conservation Corps (1970) and Young Adult Conservation Corps (1977) provided the Forest Service with new laborers but the necessity of hiring teachers, counselors, and other program officers. The Forest Service also faced the highly political ramifications of RARE II, dispute about the use of herbicides and pesticides, challenges to clear-cutting, and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Williams n.d.b:6). U.S. Grazing Service and Bureau of Land Management In 1934 Congress possed the Taylor Grazing Act. The law brought the heretofore unregulated public domain under the oversight of the small but motivated staff of the Grazing Service officials who worked with local advisory boards to allocate and manage the rangelands. The Bonanza Grazing Unit in the Klamath Basin was the first organized under the Taylor Act. It served as a prototype for the management system implemented during the New Deal. By 1936 the Grazing Service had established thirty-seven districts in eleven western states and issued 15,000 licenses for over 8.000.000 head of livestock. When amended in 114   1936, the Grazing Service gained responsibility for 142 million acres of public lands in western states. The Civilian Conservation Corps provided much of the labor to carry out Grazing Service programs in the 1930s for range improvement. The U.S. Biological Survey identified target programs for elimination of poisonous weeds, restocking with native grasses, and varmint control (Beckham 1984c:13-14). In 1946 Congress merged the Grazing Service and the General Land Office to create the Bureau of Land Management. The BLM took over responsibilities for cadastral survey, registration and patenting of mining claims, grazing and timber administration, recreation, and other responsibilities. Congress further defined the roles of the BLM through the Classification and Multiple Use Act (1964) where it mandated the administration of public lands for ""outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed and wildlife and fish purposes."" In the 1970s concern about oil embargoes and energy shortages generated a highly active period for the BLM to supervise leases for exploration of geothermal, gas, shale oil, and oil resources. In 1976 Congress enacted the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA). The law presumed that the public domain was a permanent part of America's national heritage and that its lands were to be administered in perpetuity. FLPMA affirmed multiple uses of the public domain, reaffirmed principles of cooperative management such as that under the original Taylor Grazing Act, required sustained yields, multiple use planning, wilderness designation studies, and control of mining operations. The Public Rangelands Improvement Act (PRIA) of 1978 specifically addressed range, soil, and water conditions and affirmed the need of the BLM to implement the planing process mandated by FLPMA (Muhn ond Stuart 1988). Depression Era Projects The efforts of the New Deal administration to find relief, reform, 115   and recovery in the midst of the Great Depression of the 1930s had widespread consequence throughout the Columbia Basin. The Civilian Conservation Corps, sometimes referred to as President Franklin D. Roosevelt's ""Green Army,"" played a highly important role. The CCC established camps throughout the Columbia watershed and mounted a brisk, eight-year program of construction. Because the Forest Service had long lacked staff and budget to develop facilities, the CCC filled that need. Its workers constructed thousands of miles of trails and roads and erected all types of facilities. These included campgrounds with community kitchens, rock fireplaces, and picnic tables to bridges (Throop 1979; Williams 1986). Highly important to forest management was the construction program of lookouts. By the early 1940s Woshingtan had 646. Oregon had 805, Idaho had 966, and Montana had 626 lookouts (Kresek 19859). The CCC enrolled a total of 2.5 million young men, most of them from~ urban areas in the East. It brought them west and trained them in manuol labor skills. Donald Tanasoca of New Jersey worked for the CCC in 1939 on the Payette River in Idaho. His recollections are an interesting measure of the consequences of the program: I don't think I could have spent six months of my life more profitably anywhere. It's an indelible experience in a young man's life. The fysical benefits alone were worth my enrollment. I emerged stronger, hardier and proud of a better body. I would never discourage anyone wishing to join the C's. . . . It makes a man out of anybody with guts. The outdoor life is healthy and inspiring. A city boy learns that the world is larger than just the city. This contact with noture and association with other boys broadens the mind and gives a deeper insight into life. CC life teaches a person to be independent and shows the value of money (Tanasoca 1967:24). 116   Donald Tanasoco returned to New Jersey. Thousands of others who served in the CCC did not go home. They fell in love with the West, married, and settled down to lead productive lives in a land they knew intimately from their work for the Grazing Service,.Forest Service, or in improvements in small towns. The New Deal measures changed the face of many towns in the Columbia Basin. .The Works Projects Administration (WPA) launched ambitious construction programs to erect post offices, federal office buildings, and libraries. The WPA leveled ground with hand laborers for school playgrounds, local airports, and city parks. Unemployed architects went to work to measure and record data on the built environment in the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS). Unemployed titers compiled information on folklore ond history. They wrote and published the state guidebook series. The volume for Idaho, for example, was edited by the novelist Vardis Fisher. Howard McKinley Corning, a poet, edited the Dicfionary of Oregon History in that state's program. The Historical Records Survey put workers into every county courthouse in the Columbia Basin to inventory and descrtbe their archival holdings. Many of the WPA guides were published between, 1935 and 1942 (Cressmon 1945: 170-l 73; Schwantes 1989:355). The ramifications of the New Deal touched the Columbia B,asin in other ways. The Rural Electrification Administration laid plans and worked with local utility companies to extend lines to small communities and isolated farms. The Soil Conservation Service promoted windbreaks, contour plowing, and preservation of topsoil. The Bankhead-Jones Act (1937) funded the relocation of hundreds of families who had failed at homesteading on the High Desert and closed those londs to any further public entry. One of the large Oregon tracts of nearly 100,000, for example, was designoted the Crooked River National Grassland and placed under the administrotion of the Ochoco National Forest (Minor, 117   Beckhom, Toepel and Greenspan 1987). Bonneville Power Administration Construction of dams at Bonneville and Grand Coulee created o need to distribute ond morket electricity. In 1937, in otmosphere of controversy over ""public"" versus ""privote"" power, Congress created the Bonneville Power Administration. BPA was charged with establishing electricity rates, assisting in industrial development and creation of jobs, in helping the Public Utility Districts gain electricity, and building a transmission system to move the power from doms to the public. Congress granted an initial $10.7 million in 1938 to start the process of loying transmission lines ond building substations. These included o 220.00 volt line from Grand Coulee to Bonneville, a 1 15,000 volt line from Bonneville to The Dolles, and others into western Oregon and Washington (Tollefson 1987:127-l 36). The work of the Bonneville Power Administration exponded rapidly in the 1950s with the construction of numerous new dams and generating facilities throughout the Columbia watershed. As facilities such as Dworshak Dom came on line in 1973 to produce 400,000 killowats of electricity (and o total capacity of 1 million killowats). the BPA extended transmission lines. It also became a key player in the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) and the debacle which involved the effort of that entity to build three and possibly five nuclear reactors to generate hydrothermal electricity (Tollefson 1987:360-362, 388400). In the post 150 years the involvements of the federal government have played singulor roles in the interior of the Pacific Northwest. The imprint of Uncle Sam is large. It has entailed the holding of millions of acres of land under the odministration of the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau 118   of Land Manogemeni, and other agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Congress has funded 100 years of river, canal, and lock projects, and created one of the most extensive systems of hydropower generotion facilities in the world. The federal government has worked separately and in partnership with both privote and public utility companies in these projects and in the distribution of power to commercial ond domestic users. The federal government has also had greot impact on the people of the Columbia Basin. It has created jobs, shoped local economies in wartime and peacetime with poyrolls, constructed military bases, and waged wor on the Great Depression with massive public works projects. It hos left a mixed legacy of ""good works"" and problems. The chemical weapons at the Umatillo Army Depot, unexploded munitions scattered across the Yakimo Bombing Range, and the massive toxic waste and radioactive hozards within the Hanford Reservation pose immediate and long-term problems for the area. Collectively their amelioration may force difficult decisions on funding priorities and phasing of projects. The federal government has been a remorkable player in shaping the Pacific Northwest ond the Columbia wotershed in porticulor.  119   10. Population The records of the Bureau of the Census provide an interesting perspective on the size, nature, and change in the human population of the 91 counties lying in the Columbia Bosin. The area includes land in Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon, ond two counties in Nevada, but is identifiable because the census is tallied by state, county, and precinct. The census enumerations of 1850 did not identify any residents in the project areo excepting a scatter of settlers--fewer than loo--between The Dalles and Hood River. For purposes of this study the census was examined at twenty-year intervals, 1870-1990. The numbers entered were a 100% tally of all people residing in the project area enumerated in the federal, decennial census schedules. Until 1900 this normally excluded ""lndions not taxed' who lived on reservations and were enumerated annuolly from 1887 to 1940 in the Indian Census Schedules. By 1900, however, the federal schedules also carried the Notive American population and thus they appeor in the twentieth century tallies used in this presentotion. Graph 18. Population Growth, 1870- 1990 -Idaho  --C--- Montana -.- Nevada  Click here to view Graph 18  --+-- Oregon ---A--- Washington b Wyoming  (Bureau of the Census 1872b. 1895b. 19 13b. 1932b. 1952b, 1972b. 1993)  120   In the subject area the population grew dramatically. [See Appendix, Population Growth.] The reported population in 1870 was nearly 48,000 persons. Twenty years later it had increased six-fold to 308,982. The rise was in a large degree to the impacts of mining rushes which brought thousands to the camps of eastern Oregon and Idaho and, in turn, thousands more to settle on the grasslands and river bottoms of the region. The population more than tripled by 1910 in the 91 counties to 956,535 persons and doubled to more than 1.2 million in 1930. Growth slowed in the next twenty years. The Great Depression was assuredly a factor: the impact of World War II was another. Even though military build-ups created new communities such as Camp Farragut in northern Idaho or Camp Abbot in central Oregon, they were relatively short lived. The T&Cities of southeastern Washington, however, became a permanent, new population bose in the region. In the years 1930-50 the population grew by nearly a holf million persons and almost at the same rate to 2 million in 1970. The twenty years between 1970 and 1990, however, proved highly significant to the region when the population grew by nearly 750,000 people or nearly seventy-five percent. Minorities--African-Americans, American Indians, Chinese, Japanese, and others--when enumerated, tallied less than five percent of the total population. In some precincts in mining camps in 1870 there was a relatively large Chinese population in terms of total numbers of residents in the precinct. When compared to the overall population, however, the Chinese were a small element. Native American figures continued, in most instances, to decline until the 1940s when improved health conditions and, perhaps, counting confirmed growth in their communities. A small Japanese population settled in the Treasure Valley of Malheur County, Oregon, and in the Boise Basin to engage in farming. The community did not grow sizeable but has continued to play an important role in those area's economies. 121   Data is available for 1980 on minority populations in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The following table should be considered with the realization that only Idaho lies wholly within the Columbia Basin. The data for both Oregon and Washington includes the much larger population base west of the Cascade Mountains. Table 7. Selected Minority Populations, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, 1980 African-American Number Percent Idaho 2.7 16 Oregon 37,059 Wash. 105.544 0.3 1 .4 2.6 Hispanic Percent 3.9 2.5 2.9 Native American Number Percent 10.418 26,587 50.159 1.1 I .o 1.4  Number 36,615 65.833 119.986  (Schwantes 1989:39 1) The project area contains special minorities who do not show up in any census enumeration. These include Basques, many of whom engaged in ranching and sheepherding. The Basques live in Malheur County, Oregon, and several counties in western Idaho. Another population which is a self-selecting ,social community is the Latter Day Saints. While most in the project area ore of European descent, they often work, live, and engage socially within their own community. The Mormons are distributed throughout the region but have particular concentrations in southern Idaho and parts of eastern Oregon. The Columbia Basin is an area of light population densities. The population of Idaho is 1 1.5 per square mile, while that of Oregon is 27.4 and Washington of 62.1. These latter figures, however, include the much more densely populated parts of the states west of the Cascades. Perhaps a clearer measure of the light concentration of people is the statement of Carlos Schwantes who has observed, ""If the Pacific  122   Northwest were as densely populated as New Jersey, it would contain more residents than the entire United States currently does"" (Schwantes 1989:389].  123   11. Conclusions The Columbia River watershed is a fascinating area. Joined as one geographical province and united by a common geological and ecological history, it is divided between several states and two countries. Primarily a great plain lying atop repeated flows of ancient basalts, it gives the initial impression of an arid landscape where water is scarce and extremes of summer heat and winter cold prevail. The setting is, however, far more complex, for the region is bisected by the great river system of the Columbia and its tributaries which are fed by the snowmelt and rain waters of the eastern Cascades and the Blues, Bittemoots, and Rockies. It is thus a landscape of multiple faces and tremendous potential, provided that those who lived there develop the means to use its resources. The Columbia--abundant in salmon and flowing through a land with excellent root and seed crops and nearby hunting areas--has been an Native American homeland for the past 10,000 years. The lifeways at historic contact demonstrated a deep and intense relotionship to the land and an understanding of its resources. The time-tested Plateau lifewoy focused on a seasonal round. The native world was changing even before the arrival of Lewis & Clark in 1805. The acquisition of the horse and a small flow of trade goods from the Pacific and from east of the Rockies hinted at what was to come. The Columbia Basin was traversed early by explorers and more deeply by fur seekers. Repeatedly in the 1820s Peter Skene Ogden carried out the Hudson's Bay Company policy to exterminate all furbearing animals in the Snake watershed to create a ""desert"" so devoid of attraction that any Americans crossing South Pass would surely turn back and not compete with the British. The Hudson's Bay Company policy largely succeeded. The few competitors--Jedediah Smith and 124   Nathaniel Wyeth--yielded and moved on. The fur trade remained a British monopoly. The fur trappers spied out the region, noted some of its features, and began the process of change in the traditional cultures of the Native Americans. They introduced goods, technologies, illnesses, and forces which proved highly consequential to those people. Initially both explorers and emigrants dismissed this region. Most the product of Eastern Woodland environments, they found the Columbia Basin forbidding, sandy, dusty, hot, and lacking potential. While a few saw the oasis settings of the pluvial lakes in the northern Great Basin or the well-watered stream courses along the Boise, Grande Ronde. or other rivers, most realized that the isolation of the region precluded any effective economic development beyond mere subsistence living. The agrtcultural commodities were too far from markets to make settlement a reasonable gamble. Missionary reports, narratives of travelers, emigrant guidebooks, and land hunger in the 1840s helped inspire widespread overland migration and, ultimately, the settling of the region. For two decades emigrants hurried on through the Columbia Basin. They dismissed the Snake Plain as a `wormwood barren,"" cursed the dust and winds of the Columbia Plateau, and pressed on to the woodland areas west of the Cascades. The situation began to change when stock drovers saw the tremendous acreages of well-watered meadows where they might graze their herds. They knew they could walk their cattle and sheep to market and those markets came with reasonable distance with the building of the Union Pacific-Central Pacific in 1869. Equally important was the explosive development of local markets as a result of repeated mineral rushes in the 1860s. The mines of the'upper John Day River, Blue Mountains, Salmon River, and Boise Basin set the stage for subsequent placer and lode mining and the creation of a substantial base of residents whose needs for goods, foods, and services led to the 125   development of transportation networks and local communities. Mining and ranching anchored the initial economy of the Columbia Basin. In time, the discovery of the agricultural potentials of the region for wheat, ,oats, and barley and the advent of irrigation opened many other prospects. Shipment of agricultural commodities, including fruit and vegetables, and forest products, however, remained a challenge. Even when railroad systems and steamboats laced together the region in the last three decades of the nineteenth century, the costs for shipment were high and markets were often far distant. The playing out of mineral deposits transformed some ""cities"" into ghost towns and made others--such as in northern Idaho--company towns were militant miners sometimes faced hired police representing non-resident investors. The federal government has played and continues to play a major role in the Columbia Basin. Its vast holdings of land, specific congressionally-funded initiatives, and special projects such as the atomic weapons production at Hanford, hydropower generation on the rivers, timber production and sales from the national forests, and rangeland management on the public domain have all had impact on the region. Uncle Sam's workers have enriched the cultural lives of many small towns and rural areas in the region and provided new insights and opportunities for residents who, sometimes, have had their doubts about ""outsiders"" who have come to manage ""their'lands."" The Columbia Basin is a region largely dependent on other places. Its markets are largely external. The projects which have shaped its economy have been funded from outside the region. Much of its land is owned by the people of the United States. These realities have sometimes bred frustration and hostility. They are, however, facts of life and an interesting aspect of what sets apart the interior of the Pacific Northwest as a hinterland. It is a place of few large cities yet good 126   connections with the rest of the country. It is o place of investment and private property ownership, yet a setting where public projects and national interest remain high and, sometimes, in the driver's seat. The major figures .of western history have passed this way. Indians, explorers, fur seekers, missionaries, emigrants, cattle drovers, town developers, miners, loggers, teamsters--all of that familiar cast of characters have been players in its development. Unlike some parts of the West, however, the interior of the Pacific Northwest has benefitted dramatically from federal hydropower and irrigation projects, timber harvests, and river improvements. It is a place where national agendas have been played out parallel to local interests. Both are part of the same history. The calculation is an interesting one even when it is not fully understood by those who have lived through it. Such, perhaps, is the nature of the human experience, for it is difficult to understand one's own history while living it.  127   Bibliography Abbott, Henry L. and Robert Stockton Williamson 1857 General Report: Routes in California and Oregon.

(( unless the horse is being warmed up on the way to and just prior to entering the paddock for the next race to be run. )) (( (2) When a horse is being so warmed up before entering the paddock, his official program number shall be displayed by the rider. )) (( (3) ))  (2)  In a race, each horse shall carry a conspicuous saddlecloth number and a head number, corresponding to his number on the official program.  In the case of an entry each horse making up the entry shall carry the same number (head and saddlecloth) with a distinguishing letter.  For example, 1-1A, 1X.  In the case of a field the horses comprising the field shall carry an individual number; i.e., 12, 13, 14, 15, and so on. (( (4) ))  (3)  After the horses enter the track, no jockey shall dismount and no horse shall be entitled to the care of an attendant without consent of the stewards or the starter, and the horse must be free of all hands other than those of the jockey or assistant starter before the starter releases the barrier. (( (5) ))  (4)  In case of accident to a jockey, his mount or equipment, the stewards or the starter may permit the jockey to dismount and the horse to be cared for during the delay, and may permit all jockeys to dismount and all horses to be attended during the delay. (( (6) ))  (5)  All horses shall parade and, under penalty of disqualification, shall carry their weight from the paddock to the starting post, such parade to pass the steward's stand. (( (7) ))  (6)  After entering the track not more than 12 minutes shall be consumed in the parade of the horses to the post except in cases of unavoidable delay.  After passing the stand once, horses will be allowed to break formation and canter, warm up or go as they please to the post.  When horses have reached the post, they shall be started without unnecessary delay. (( (8) ))  (7)  If the jockey is so injured on the way to the post as to require another jockey, the horse shall be taken to the paddock and another jockey obtained. (( (9) ))  (8)  No person shall wilfully delay the arrival of a horse at the post. (( (10) ))  (9)  No person other than the rider, starter, or assistant starter shall be permitted to strike a horse, or attempt, by shouting or otherwise to assist it in getting a start.

[Statutory Authority:   RCW 67.16.020  and  67.16.040 .  81-08-013 (Order 81-01),  260-52-010, filed 3/24/81; Rules 187 through 196, filed 4/21/61.]   AMENDATORY SECTION (Amending Order 74.2, filed 10/30/74) WAC 260-52-030   Starting the race.   (( (1) The starter shall give orders to secure a fair start.  After reasonable efforts, if a horse cannot be led or backed into position, the starter shall order the horse to be taken to the outside.  The start must not be delayed on account of bad-mannered horses.  When the stall gate is used, it shall be placed on the track at the discretion of the starter. (2) The starter is required to load horses into the starting gate in order of post position:  Provided, That the starter may load known fractious horses out of order at his discretion. (3) All races shall be started by a starting gate approved by the commission, except that with permission of the stewards a race may be started without a gate.  When a race is started with or without a gate, there shall be no start until, and no recall after, the assistant starter has dropped his flag in answer to that of the starter. (4) If a horse is locked in the gate, the starter shall immediately notify the stewards who in turn shall immediately notify the manager of pari-mutuel department.  The starter shall be the sole judge of what horse or horses are prevented from starting in a race through failure of gates to open. )) (1) The starter is responsible for assuring that each participant receives a fair start. (2) If, when the starter dispatches the field, any door at the front of the starting gate stalls should not open properly due to a mechanical failure or malfunction or should any action by any starting personnel directly cause a horse to receive an unfair start, the stewards may declare such a horse a non-starter. (3) Should a horse, not scratched prior to the start, not be in the starting gate stall thereby causing it to be left when the field is dispatched by the starter, the horse shall be declared a non-starter by the stewards. (4) Should an accident or malfunction of the starting gate, or other unforeseeable event compromise the fairness of the race or the safety of race participants, the stewards may declare individual horses to be non-starters, exclude individual horses from one or more parimutuel pools or declare a ""no contest"" and refund all wagers except as otherwise provided in the rules involving multi-race wagers.   [Order  74.2 ,  260-52-030, filed 10/30/74; Order  73.7 ,  260-52-030, filed 12/3/73; Rules 247, 248, 249 and 254, filed 4/21/61.]   AMENDATORY SECTION (Amending WSR 81-08-013, filed 3/24/81) WAC 260-52-040   Post to finish.   (( (1) When clear, a horse may be taken to any part of the course, except that crossing or weaving in front of contenders may constitute interference or intimidation for which the offender may be disciplined. (2) A horse crossing so as actually to impede another horse is disqualified, unless the impeded horse was partly in fault or the crossing was wholly caused by the fault of some other horse or jockey. (3) If a horse or jockey jostle another horse, the aggressor may be disqualified, unless the jostled horse or his jockey was partly in fault or the jostle was wholly caused by the fault of some other horse or jockey. (4) If a jockey wilfully strikes another horse or jockey, or rides wilfully or carelessly so as to injure another horse, which is in no way in fault, or so as to cause other horses to do so, his horse is disqualified. (5) When a horse is disqualified under this rule the other horse or horses in the same race coupled as an entry under  WAC 260-48-110  may be disqualified. (6) Complaints under this rule can only be received from the owner, trainer or jockey of the horse alleged to be aggrieved, and must be made to the clerk of the scales or to the stewards before or immediately after his jockey has passed the scales.  But nothing in this rule shall prevent the stewards taking cognizance of foul riding. (7) Any jockey against whom a foul is claimed shall be given the opportunity to appear before the stewards before any decision is made by them. (8) A jockey whose horse has been disqualified or who unnecessarily causes his horse to shorten his stride with a view to complaint, or an owner, trainer or jockey who complains frivolously that his horse was crossed or jostled, may be punished. (9) All horses are expected to give their best efforts in races in which they run, and any instructions or advice to jockeys to ride or handle their mounts otherwise than for the purpose of winning are forbidden and will subject all persons giving or following such instructions or advice to disciplinary action by the stewards and the commission. (10) No jockey carrying a whip during a race shall fail to use the whip in a manner consistent with using his best efforts to win.  Jockeys are prohibited from whipping a horse during the post parade, over the head, or in an excessive or brutal manner. )) (1) All horses shall be ridden out in every race.  A jockey shall not ease up or coast to the finish, without reasonable cause, even if the horse has no apparent chance to win prize money.  A jockey shall give a best effort during a race, and each horse shall be ridden to win.  No jockey shall unnecessarily cause his/her horse to shorten its stride so as to give the appearance of having suffered a foul. (2) If a jockey strikes or touches another jockey or another jockey's horse or equipment, his/her mount may be disqualified. (3) When clear in a race a horse may be ridden to any part of the course, but if any horse swerves, or is ridden to either side, so as to interfere with, impede or intimidate any other horse, it may be disqualified; (4) A horse which interferes with another and thereby causes any other horse to lose ground or position or causes any other horse to break stride, when such other horse is not at fault and when such interference occurs in a part of the race where the horse interfered with loses the opportunity to place where it might, in the opinion of the stewards be reasonably be expected to finish, may be disqualified; (5) If the stewards determine the foul was intentional, or due to careless riding, the jockey may be held responsible; (6) In a straightaway race, every horse must maintain position as nearly as possible in the lane in which it starts.  If a horse is ridden, drifts or swerves out of its lane in such a manner that it interferes with, impedes or intimidates another horse, it is a foul and may result in the disqualification of the offending horse. (7) When the stewards determine that a horse shall be disqualified, they may place the offending horse behind such horses as in their judgment it interfered with, or they may place it last; (8) If a horse is disqualified, any horse or horses with which it is coupled as an entry may also be disqualified; (9) When a horse is disqualified in a time trial race, for the purposes of qualifying only, it shall receive the time of the horse it is placed behind plus one-hundredth of a second penalty or more exact measurement if photo finish equipment permits, and shall be eligible to qualify for the finals or consolations of the race on the basis of the assigned time; (10) Possession of any electrical or mechanical stimulating or shocking device by a jockey, horse owner, trainer or other person authorized to handle or attend to a horse shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of these rules and is sufficient grounds for the stewards to scratch or disqualify the horse; (11) The stewards may determine that a horse shall be unplaced for the purpose of purse distribution and time trial qualification. (12) No jockey carrying a whip during a race shall fail to use the whip in a manner consistent with using his/her best efforts to win. (13) Any jockey who uses a whip during the running of a race is prohibited from whipping a horse: (a) in an excessive or brutal manner; (b) on the head, flanks, or on any part of its body other then the shoulders or hind quarters; (c) during the post parade except when necessary to control the horse; (d) when the horse is clearly out of the race.

The incident occurred on Monday, October 15, 2001, at a time when the     nation was on alert because of terrorist activities involving anthrax powder     in government facilities. Because of the possible threat, all or part of the     BLM office was closed for a period of time and an affected employee was     subjected to physical tests and was placed on antibiotics. The substance was     eventually tested an found not to be hazardous.       ""This incident was more than a hoax,"" said BLM District Manager     Sue Richardson. ""Not only was there a considerable amount of lost-work     time because the office was closed for a day, but BLM personnel were also     involved in the response and investigation. I am especially concerned     because this event also caused a great deal of stress and concern among our     employees who were already coping with the events of September 11 th      and the aftermath of events involving anthrax in other government     facilities. This irresponsible behavior should not be tolerated and we are     doing everything we can to assure that it doesn’t happen again.""       Persons with information are being urged to contact Coos Stop Crime at     267-6666 or 1-800-368-6425.  All calls are confidential.             -BLM-"

GX255-32-4887103	"Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  CHAPTER 2 CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE AND ALTERNATIVES This chapter is divided into two sections: ""Continuing Management Guidance"" and resource management ""Plan Alternatives."" The first section is a summary of the objectives, basic management policy, and program direction that is applicable regardless of which alternative is selected. The second section is a presentation of four plan alternatives developed as possible solutions to the issues discussed in Chapter 1. Each alternative presents a different blend and balance of resource allocations and emphasis. All alternatives comply with the FLPMA requirement that the public lands be managed by the principles of multiple use and sustained yield. When coupled with the continuing management guidance, any of the plan alternatives could be implemented as the selected RMP. This RMP will provide multiple use planning for the area while consolidating and updating the existing management decisions contained in existing plans. Appendix A lists previous decisions that have been carried forward and, based on new resource information and updated Bureau guidance, provides the basis for determining which decisions remain valid and which will be revised through this RMP. The decisions presented in Appendix A received environmental analysis in previous land use or activity planning efforts. These decisions represent continuing management or monitoring requirements tied back to continued implementation of existing activity plans, regulation, or policy. When approved, the Farmington RMP will constitute the final land use plan that will supersede all previous land use planning decisions. The RMP alternatives are designed to provide a management foundation for the public lands. Where necessary, specific actions will be detailed in future activity plans with accompanying Environmental Assessments (EA). Activity plans describe how a particular area or resource will be managed, and will comply with the allowable resource uses, levels of production, resource condition goals, program constraints, and general management practices documented in the RMP.  CONTINUING MA GUIDANCE  NAGEMENT  This section describes the objectives, basic management policy, and program direction that will continue to apply under all alternatives. This direction is fundamental and its associated guidance is based on laws, regulations, manuals, policies, executive orders, memoranda, and applicable planning documents. A summary of authorizing actions that guide BLM management decisions is included in Appendix K. The information that follows pertains to public land in the FFO area, except as noted.  Minerals It is the policy of the BLM to make mineral resources available for disposal and to encourage development of mineral resources to meet national, regional, and local needs, consistent with national objectives of an adequate supply of minerals at reasonable market prices. At the same time, the BLM strives to ensure that mineral development is carried out in a manner that minimizes environmental damage and provides for the rehabilitation of affected lands. The following sections describe continuing management guidance for oil and gas, coal, and salable and locatable minerals.  Oil and Gas In developing the alternatives for analysis, the BLM commissioned a study conducted by New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NM Tech) working with oil and gas industry representatives to identify reasonable foreseeable demand for oil and gas development in the San Juan Basin. This study resulted in a RFDS, which forms the basis for projected oil and gas development in the  2-1   CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  planning area over the next 20 years. The RFDS (Engler et al. 2001) projects 9,970 new well bores on federal minerals and a total of 12,461 new well bores on all land in the San Juan Basin over the next 20 years. An estimated 54 percent of these wells are expected to involve new surface disturbance. The remaining 46 percent of the wells is anticipated to be developed on existing disturbed sites through re-completion, dual completion, or directional drilling. Each new well pad is estimated to average two acres in finished size and involve another acre of associated road and pipeline disturbance (50-foot right-of-way [ROW] for both road and pipeline). This section addresses policies guiding oil and gas on federal land in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, including USFS and USBR land. The 1920 Mineral Leasing Act, as amended, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease oil and gas resources on all public domain and federally acquired lands. Lands excluded from such leasing by legislation or secretarial policy are listed in CFR Title 43, Part 3100.0-3. They include units of the National Park System; incorporated cities, towns, and villages; and lands recommended for wilderness study, as well as lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System. BLM Lease Form 3100-11, Offer to Lease and Lease for Oil and Gas, contains STCs that grant the leaseholder the right to develop the oil and gas resource and provide for the general protection of surface and subsurface resources under normal operations. The BLM, as agent for the Secretary of the Interior, is responsible for processing APDs and administering or assisting with the minerals development programs on BLM, USBR, USFS and other lands with federal minerals. BLM responsibilities include conducting pre-drill inspections of the proposed drill sites; assessing the status of cultural and threatened or endangered species clearances; conducting compliance inspections and enforcement actions for lease terms and conditions, safety, production verification, and site maintenance;  and abandonment inspections of drilling locations. In situations where there are federal minerals underlying tribal, state, private, or other land ownership (split estate), the BLM issues the APDs and encourages the operator or lessee to obtain consent and agreements for surface use from the private surface owner. BLM regulations, orders, notices, standard conditions of approval, and general requirements constitute the range of standard procedures and environmental protection measures that are applied to individual operators and projects, as applicable, and are authorized by 43 CFR 3160. BLM Onshore Oil and Gas Orders and Notices to Lessees are applied as standard operating procedures. The New Mexico BLM has issued a number of Notice to Lessees (NTL) to those companies that operate on federal and Indian leases. The NTLs provide instructions for a specific field or area of a jurisdictional BLM district or state. The NTLs are consistent with or exceed the minimum standards specified in the 43 CFR 3160 regulations or Onshore Orders. Because of growing concerns and public complaints over the increased amount of loud, continuous noise in the field office area, the FFO staff has developed an NTL to address noise. Equivalent wording will be used in a stipulation applied to noise generating activities permitted by ROWs. The objective of the NTL or stipulation is to maintain noise from oil and gas development on public lands at levels compatible with other uses. The two NTLs are analyzed in this document under Alternatives C and D. The NTLs are located in Appendix E. Noise associated with oil and gas development varies according to the activity occurring. Noise occurs at different levels during construction, drilling, production, and abandonment phases. Noise generated may be short-term and transient in nature (i.e., construction noise generated from heavy equipment used for building roads, pipelines, or well pads). Noise created during the construction process would be localized and occur during daylight hours for the period of time it takes to complete the project; then, it 2-2   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  would stop. Oil and gas related noise may also be continuous and long-term, such as that associated with compressor stations, well head compressors, and pumpjacks used during the production phase of development. The BLM applies STCs and special stipulations to the construction and operation of wells, pipelines, and compressors. STCs address the condition and management of the well location, associated equipment, access road, and reseeding and abandonment. STCs also ensure protection of cultural resources, compliance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended, and the conservation of sensitive species. The FFO uses the ""BLM General Requirements for Oil and Gas Operations on Federal and Indian Lands"" as a COA that describes general requirements and standard plan of operations for wells drilled in its jurisdiction. The conditions may be supplemented by additional mitigation measures supplied by applicable surface managing agencies or surface owners in cases of split estates. If a surface managing agency or surface owner has supplied to the BLM and the operator a written environmental requirement, the requirement would be incorporated into the APD if it does not affect adjacent federal or Indian surface; does not compromise safety or conservation; or does not negate minimal federal restoration requirements in cases of abandonment. Surface managing agencies include the USBR, USFS, BIA, and National Park Service (NPS). Surface owners can include private surface owners, Indian tribes, and the State of New Mexico. The BLM grants approvals for routine modifications to a well's construction and operating plan via sundry notice. The BLM must decide what lands are to be leased to access federal minerals and whether special management constraints modifying the STCs are needed to protect the environment and other resources. For example, many of these constraints are designed to reduce erosion and sedimentation in order to minimize the impacts on soil and water resources. These constraints are generally appended to a lease at  the time of lease offer or as COAs on APDs, often within special management designations such as Special Management Areas (SMA) or Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC). Stipulations include seasonal closures, or Timing Limitations (TL), that prohibit exploration, development, or any surface disturbing activities for designated time periods during the year to benefit wildlife. Controlled Surface Use (CSU) constraints are used to identify restrictions on well locations, surface use, or operations year-round in order to protect specific resource values or uses. No Surface Occupancy (NSO) constraints are intended for use when other constraints are insufficient to adequately protect the resource values and uses. Lease exceptions, modifications, and waivers of management constraints can only be granted by the BLM if circumstances have changed or if the lessee demonstrates that operations can be conducted without harming the protected resource values and uses. Exceptions, modifications, and waivers are considered on a case-by-case basis as changes in the resource or management situation occur. An EA that meets NEPA requirements is prepared to evaluate the potential impacts of the proposed change. Site-specific EAs are required prior to siting a new well. During this process, environmental impacts are identified and management constraints are developed, which will mitigate impacts to the environment, public health and safety, cultural resources, and threatened, endangered, and sensitive species. The mitigation measures become the COAs attached to the permits for surface disturbing activities, such as APDs and sundry notices. Similarly, mitigation measures are attached as stipulations to ROW grants, terms, and conditions on geophysical operations. Each mitigation measure is applied to protect a resource that would be affected by the operation being approved, even on existing leases. A reclamation plan and a weed management plan are also required. 2-3   CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  The USFS cooperates with the BLM to ensure that management goals and objectives are achieved, surface impacts are mitigated to the maximum degree practicable, and the land affected is rehabilitated. The Federal Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act of 1988 bestowed upon USFS the authority to consent to BLM leasing decisions. The Act gave USFS the authority to approve surface use plans filed as part of APDs. The USFS responds to BLM proposals to issue mineral leases and permits after reviewing its land management plans. The USFS requires reclamation plans for all proposed surface-disturbing activities to return the land to productive uses consistent with the ecological capability of the area and in accordance with land management goals. Applicable plans in the planning area are the Carson National Forest Plan, September 1986, as amended in October 1990, and Santa Fe National Forest Plan, as amended in October 1996. Numerous mineral leases were located on USBR lands at Navajo Reservoir prior to their withdrawal for construction and operation of the dam and reservoir. The USBR is in the process of developing an RMP (USBR 1999), which is presently in the draft stage. One of the plan's objectives is to formally coordinate management of USBR lands with the BLM, which manages adjacent lands and is responsible for the management of minerals development on USBR lands. The BLM's responsibility extends to environmental protection, public health, and safety associated with federal oil and gas operations. Lease rights granted by the BLM include the right to occupy as much of the lease surface as is reasonable to extract the resource and the right to remove oil and/or gas. On USBR lands, these leases are managed by the BLM under the terms of a 1967 agreement that provides for review and concurrence by the USBR. As part of the review and concurrence process, the USBR has defined mitigation measures that are applicable to mineral extraction activities on USBR lands. The BLM may also grant, with USBR concurrence, approval for other uses, such as  utility ROW on withdrawn lands not specifically allocated to recreation or fish and wildlife purposes.  Coal The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) of 1977 (30 USC 1201 et seq.) requires application of ""unsuitability criteria"" prior to coal leasing. Unsuitability criteria are used to screen out areas unsuitable for mining for various reasons (e.g., environmental conflicts). The criteria are part of 43 CFR 3461, and are included in Appendix C. Project-specific EAs are developed prior to leasing and before mining is approved, with the purpose of analyzing the impacts of coal mining on the natural and cultural resources in the area of the proposed mine site. During this process BLM coordinates with all appropriate agencies of state, federal, and tribal governments. A reclamation plan and a weed management plan are also required. The FFO is responsible for inspection and enforcement on all coal leases to ensure compliance with lease terms and conditions and with stipulations for development exploration. Inspections are performed to ensure maximum economic recovery and conformance with the approved mining or exploration plan. The FFO is also responsible for product verification by independently auditing mine production reports to ensure fair royalty reporting to the federal government and The Navajo Nation.  Salable and Locatable Minerals Federal lands in the planning area are important sources of mineral materials for construction projects in the region, including sand and gravel, rock and stone, and other fill materials. The FFO issues Contracts (Form 3600-9 and 5450-5) and Permits (Form 5510-1) for the removal of mineral materials managed under 43 CFR 3600. These contracts and permits can be issued for up to five years and 200,000 cubic yards of material. Any amount greater than 200,000 cubic yards must be offered through a competitive bid. A mining plan, a reclamation plan, and a weed 2-4   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  management plan are required with the contract or permit application, and plans must conform with modern mining and reclamation standards. The proposed operation plan goes through the NEPA process with the preparation of an EA, and is approved if the mining and reclamation plans comply with the FFO RMP and include appropriate mitigation measures, if needed. The FFO is responsible for inspection and enforcement on all contracts and permits. The program to manage the extraction of locatable minerals, such as uranium, is also under the purview of the FFO under 43 CFR 3809. This program is currently inactive due to the lack of demand. The FFO program defines three levels of activity: 1) casual use using nonmechanized equipment, 2) notice level comprising less than five acres of surface disturbance, and 3) plan level comprising more than five acres of surface disturbance and heap leaching operations.  equivalent to an average natural gas well in the San Juan Basin. Economic and societal forces beyond the control of the BLM dictate the level of interest in renewable energy. To date, the FFO has not received any applications for location of renewable energy generation sites. Future applications would undergo site-specific environmental analysis as part of the right-ofway or commercial lease process.  Lands The objective of the FFO lands program is to facilitate the acquisition, exchange, or disposal of public lands in order to provide the most efficient management of public resources. The program is responsible for processing land withdrawals, granting ROWs and easements on public lands, and acquiring easements on nonpublic lands where necessary. The lands program also issues leases and patents under the R&PP Act, and licenses and permits for specific uses such as filming or special events.  Renewable Energy Program At present there are no renewable energy facilities on public lands in the FFO. The BLM, in conjunction with the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, has conducted an assessment of the opportunities for development of renewable energy resources on lands managed by the BLM. The draft report, Assessing the Potential for Renewable Energy on Federal Lands (BLM 2002b), indicates that the Farmington Field Office is in the list of top 25 BLM planning units with high potential for concentrating solar power sites. The FFO did not meet the screening criteria to be considered as a potential area for the location of wind, biomass, or geothermal energy generation facilities. According to the Renewable Energy Atlas of the West (Nielsen et al. 2002) the planning area is rated as Class 1 (Poor) for wind power generation and exhibits an Annual Solar Insolation Average of 5.6-6.0 kilowatt hours per meter squared per day (kWh/m2/day). With present technology, it is estimated that a 4-acre array of solar panels would be required to generate the energy  Land Ownership Adjustment The basic concept of land ownership adjustment for the FFO follows the requirements of FLPMA. Land will generally remain in federal ownership unless it meets specific criteria in FLPMA and existing land use plans. The primary goal is conserving federal ownership while consolidating administrative boundaries to create a more efficient and economical land ownership pattern. This is accomplished through retaining, acquiring, and disposing of land for the purposes of consolidation that is in the public interest. Acquisition of lands that would enhance and protect important resources will continue to be a priority for the FFO. Lands would only be acquired from owners willing to dispose of them. Currently, there are 145,000 acres of non-federal land within special management designations that are a high priority for acquisition. Also, a program to facilitate exchange of land between BLM and the State of New Mexico will continue when the exchange improves the management potential  2-5   CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  of state and federal land. Where state or private lands are intermingled with public land, BLM may acquire land to help consolidate public use areas. Disposal may be by means of transfer, exchange, sale, withdrawal (to another federal entity), or other means. Lands will be transferred to another federal agency if use and management by that agency is suitable and serves a purpose. Lands may be exchanged or sold if they are difficult or uneconomical to manage, are not suitable for management by another federal entity, no longer serve a specific purpose, or if disposal would serve important public objectives. Disposal of lands meeting the above criteria is a priority. Much of the land south and west of U.S. Highway 550 (US 550) is currently identified for exchange. The FFO has been successful over the last 25 years in transferring about 131,000 acres and exchanging 150,000 acres with The Navajo Nation. Exchanges have slowed down, since the most easily executed exchanges have been completed. However, the FFO will continue to process exchanges that are identified in the future. Sales of public land identified in the 1988 RMP will continue. Appendix F includes a list of isolated disposal parcels. Sales will all be considered on a case-by-case basis for conformity with FLPMA criteria. Land sales will be disposed of at or above fair market value. All land adjustment actions must go through the NEPA process. In general, under all land adjustments, the BLM will protect valid existing rights. These would include authorized permits, leases, ROW, and licenses. The FFO will continue a prevention program developed by BLM, The Navajo Nation, and BIA to prevent unauthorized occupation.  patented. All applications are subject to public review and the NEPA process.  Land Withdrawal The FFO will continue to review existing withdrawals on a periodic basis to ensure that the reasons for the withdrawal are still valid and only the acreage needed is retained in withdrawn status. Policy will continue to minimize the amount of land withdrawn (particularly from mining and mineral leasing) in favor of leases, permits, or cooperative use agreements that are more flexible. Upon revocation or modification of a withdrawal, all or part of the withdrawn land could be restored to multiple use. Additional land may be identified for withdrawal if criteria are met and would be processed on a case-by-case basis.  Rights-of-Way Under the authority of FLPMA and the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, the FFO grants ROW leases and permits to qualified individuals, businesses, and government entities for use of public lands. Since the 1950s, oil and gas production, and to a lesser extent coal mining, has been the major industry in the region. This has made energy-related ROWs for roads and pipelines one of the primary activities in the FFO lands program. The FFO processes ROW applications for access, utilities and telephone lines, fiber optic lines, and other communication sites. All ROW applications will continue to receive environmental review on a case-by-case basis. To the extent possible, new ROWs will be located within or parallel to existing ROWs or ROW corridors to minimize resource impacts. Priority will be given to the ROWs identified in the 2002 Western Utility Group (WUG) revision (WUG 2002) of the 1992 Western Regional Corridor Study (WRCS) (WUG 1992) when considering corridor needs. BLM regulations specify the typical width allowed for different uses, including pipelines, roadways, and utility lines.  Recreation and Public Purpose Lands will continue to be available for disposal to governmental or non-profit entities under the R&PP Act for public parks, building sites and correction centers, or other public purposes. BLM generally leases the land for up to five years or until substantial development has been completed and then the land may be  2-6   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Lee Acres Landfill The Lee Acres Landfill is a closed landfill formerly operated under permit from BLM by San Juan County as a municipal solid waste disposal site from 1962 to 1986. During the 1980s use of the landfill expanded to also allow the disposal of liquid waste. In 1985 maintenance activities resulted in a release of liquid waste and hydrogen sulfide gas. Several people were hospitalized due to inhalation of the gas. Closure of the landfill occurred shortly thereafter and the area was evaluated because of hazardous material concerns. Evaluations resulted in the landfill being listed on the National Priorities List by EPA. This listing required further assessment and development of a plan to remediate the potential hazardous material concerns at the landfill. BLM is currently in negotiation with the EPA and New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) on a Record of Decision (ROD) under authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which will guide the final cleanup at the landfill. The Lee Acres Landfill ROD will guide and direct how cleanup will proceed at the site, how monitoring will be conducted and any necessary follow-up actions would be implemented. Additionally the ROD may provide guidance on other actions, which should be taken to protect the public health, welfare and environment from hazardous substances that may remain on the landfill following completion of remedial action. In order to assist with the institutional controls required to implement the ROD the BLM has already withdrawn 134.68 acres of public land, within which the landfill is located, from settlement, sale, location and entry as described in Public Land Order No. 7234 (62 Federal Register 2177, January 15, 1997). The current withdrawal will remain in effect until January 15, 2047. The withdrawal does not prohibit all activities on the withdrawn land. A primary intention of the withdrawal is to prevent withdrawal of ground water beneath the site in order to preclude unacceptable risk to human 2-7  health or the environment due to exposure to hazardous substances remaining at the site. Other activities may occur at BLM's discretion if they do not interfere with protecting the public health and environment from hazardous substances as outlined by the objectives and requirements identified in the Lee Acres Landfill ROD.  Roads and Access The FFO has not had an active easement acquisition program. This is largely due to the numerous roads located throughout the FFO area that have historically been open to the public. For the most part, this network of roads (estimated at over 15,000 miles) was generated by oil and gas development in the San Juan Basin. Normally, only one or two easements are acquired each year. As required by Bureau policy, these easements generally provide legal access to BLM-initiated range improvement projects and recreation areas. The FFO has designated 13 OHV Management Units to serve as the basis for maintenance and transportation planning. The field office is conducting an inventory of the existing road system to identify the major collector roads that could serve as the backbone for the FFO road network. This is the first step in a process to classify and designate all levels of roads within the system based on traffic levels, type of use, condition and other criteria. Subsequently, any special restrictions, needs, or actions would be defined. Improvements would be based on the ""Gold Book"" (USDI 1989) that provides generic guidelines and basic stipulations for road development. The BLM Manual 9113 on Roads provides additional guidelines and standards for construction and maintenance of transportation system roads on public lands. The San Juan Basin Public Roads Committee includes members from the oil and gas industry and the FFO. The committee has developed and agreed upon a set of bylaws, which constitute a San Juan Basin Public Roads Maintenance Committee agreement (Appendix D) that will address the issue of road   CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  maintenance on BLM system roads within the San Juan Basin. Under this agreement, 95 percent of the cost for system road maintenance will be paid by the oil and gas industry. FLPMA enables the use of cost-share authorizations to provide the financing by users for road construction and maintenance. BLM would still incur the cost of upgrading and maintaining system roads that access federal facilities through the Deferred Maintenance and Capital Improvement Process. The USFS is beginning a Roads Analysis Policy that is an integrated ecological, social, and economic science-based approach to transportation planning that addresses existing and future road management options. Three levels of analysis to be conducted include Forest-wide evaluation of major arterial and collector roads, inventory of all roads within a fifth order watershed, and project-level analysis if roads are required. Currently, all roads are classified as Level 2 maintenance standard, which is typically 1 or 1 lanes wide, with turnouts, crowned, and ditched.  vegetation provide protection on a given site to minimize erosion and assist in meeting state and tribal water quality standards. Indicators for this standard may include, but are not limited to, the following:  Consistent with the ecological site, soils appropriate amounts vegetation, protective cover. capability of the are stabilized by of standing live litter and/or rock    Erosion is indicated by flow patterns characteristics of surface litter soil movement, gullies and rills, and plant pedestalling. Satisfactory plant protection is indicated by the amount and distribution of desired species necessary to prevent accelerated erosion.    Biotic Communities, Including Native, Threatened, Endangered, and Special Status Species Standard Ecological processes such as the hydrologic cycle, nutrient cycle, and energy flow support productive and diverse native biotic communities, including special status, threatened, and endangered species. Desired plant community goals maintain and conserve productive and diverse populations of plants and animals that sustain ecological functions and processes. Restoration should first be achieved with native plants, and when appropriate, non-native plants. Indicators for this standard may include, but are not limited to, the following:  Commensurate with the capability of the ecological site, plant and animal populations are productive, resilient, diverse, and sustainable. Landscapes are composed of communities in a variety of successional stages and patterns. Diversity and composition of communities are indicated by the kinds and amount of species. Endangered and special status species are secure and recovering, with the goal  Public Land Health All BLM activities are expected to meet the New Mexico Standards for Public Land Health that were accepted by the Secretary of the Interior as part of the Record of Decision for the Statewide RMP Amendment/EIS for Standards for Public Land Health and Guidelines for Livestock Grazing Management (BLM 2000a). BLM staff determines whether activities meet the standards by evaluating the results against indicators developed for each standard. The standards describe the conditions needed for healthy public lands under three categories, Upland Sites, Biotic Communities, and Riparian Sites, summarized below.  Upland Sites Standard Healthy upland ecological sites are in a productive and sustainable condition within the capability of the site. Upland soils meeting the standard are stabilized and exhibit infiltration and permeability rates that are appropriate for the soil type, climate, and landform. The combined kind, amount, and/or pattern of 2-8         Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  of delisting and ensuring that additional species need not be listed within New Mexico.  Visual Resource Management Legislation such as FLPMA, NEPA, and SMCRA outline the BLM's responsibilities for protecting the quality of the visual (scenic) values of public lands. Policy and management guidance is also provided in BLM manuals 8400, 8410-1, and 8431-1. Public lands have a variety of visual values. These different values warrant different levels of management. Because providing the same level of management for all visual resources is neither desirable nor practical, the BLM systematically identifies and evaluates these resources to determine an appropriate level of management. Visual values are identified through the BLM Visual Resource Management (VRM) inventory process and are considered with other resource values in the RMP. The inventory consists of a scenic quality evaluation, a visual sensitivity level analysis, and a delineation of distance zones. Based on these three factors, BLM-administered lands are placed into one of four visual resource inventory classes (Class I through Class IV). A VRM class identifies suggested degrees of human modifications that should be allowed in a landscape to protect visual resources, with Class I allowing the least modification and Class IV the most. VRM classes are not used as a device to stop surface disturbing activities. Most of the planning area is presently designated as a Class III or Class IV. These classes provide the visual management standards for the design and development of future projects and for rehabilitation of existing projects. Visual design considerations shall be incorporated into all surface-disturbing projects regardless of size or potential impact and is a management responsibility shared by all resource management programs. The inventory classes represent the relative value of the visual resources, with Class I assigned to areas where the visual value is the greatest. These include WAs, WSAs, wild and scenic rivers, and other congressionally and administratively designated areas where  Riparian Sites Standard Healthy riparian areas are in a productive, properly functioning, and sustainable condition, within the capability of each site. There is present adequate vegetation of diverse age and composition to withstand high stream flow, capture sediment, provide for groundwater recharge, provide habitat, and assist in meeting state and tribal water quality standards. Indicators for this standard may include, but are not limited to the following:  Stream channel morphology and stability as determined by gradient, width/depth ratio, channel roughness, and sinuosity. Streambank stability as determined by degree of shearing, sloughing, and vegetative cover on the bank. Appropriate riparian vegetation includes a mix of communities comprised of species with a range of age, density, and growth form.      Specially Designated Areas The objective of the SDAs in the FFO is to protect, maintain, and enhance the special resource values on public lands. Areas that have special resource values are identified where some uses may be restricted in order to protect the resources. These areas include public lands such as SMAs, ACECs, Wilderness Areas (WA), Wilderness Study Areas (WSA), Special Recreation Management Areas (SRMA), and Research Natural Areas (RNA). The FFO and AFO generally identify areas with special designations as SMAs or ACECs. Other federal lands and state facilities within the planning area are also managed for special purposes. The FFO will continue to designate ACECs and other SDAs and to apply management prescription to protect the resource value of those areas.  2-9   CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  decisions have been made to preserve a natural landscape. Each class designation has a defined management objective.  Class IPreserve the existing character of the landscape. This class provides for natural and ecological changes; however, it does not preclude very limited management activity. The level of change can be very low and not attract attention. Class IIRetain the existing character of the landscape. The level of change to the characteristic landscape should be low. Management activities may be seen, but should not attract the attention of the casual observer. Any changes must repeat the basic elements of form, line, color, and texture found in the predominant natural features of the characteristic landscape. Class IIIPartially retain the existing character of the landscape. The level of change to the characteristic landscape should be moderate. Management activities may attract attention, but should not dominate the view of the casual observer. Changes should repeat the basic elements found in the predominant natural features of the characteristic landscape.  this planning effort. New proposals would be managed to meet the intent of the VRM designations determined by this plan.  Soils and Water The BLM's soil and watershed program places emphasis on preventing and/or avoiding further degradation of soil and water resources, as well as their conservation. The program contributes to the success of other resource programs and has a legislation mandate for the protection, restoration, and improvement of these resources. The BLM will continue to support the Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly Soil Conservation Service) in the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The 1974 Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act (as amended, 1984) directs the Secretary of the Interior to ""...develop a comprehensive program for minimizing salt contributions to the Colorado River from lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management."" Although the BLM is the largest landowner in several subwatersheds of the San Juan Basin, other owners and agencies must be involved in improving environmental conditions. Coordinated Resource Management Plans have been a successful means for the participation of a diverse group in improving resource management. The FFO will promote the Coordinated Resource Management Plan process within the San Juan Basin to improve resource conditions when opportunities arise. Soil and water conservation practices will be used to develop site-specific Best Management Practices (BMP) at the project level to prevent or reduce the amount of pollution to a level compatible with water quality goals. The soils program will continue to provide support to other resource activities in the FFO and also continue to emphasize its legislative mandates for the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of the soil resources. Policy and guidance for the management of soil resources associated with lands administered by the BLM are administered in Manual Sections 7000 and 7100.      Class IVProvide for management activities that require major modification of the existing character of the landscape. The level of change to the characteristic landscape can be high. These management activities may dominate the view and be the major focus of viewer attention. However, every attempt should be made to minimize the impact of these activities through careful location, minimal disturbance, and repeating the basic elements. VRM classes acknowledge existing visual contrasts. More restrictive requirements would not be retroactively applied to existing projects should VRM classifications change as a result of    2-10   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Legislative mandates are also in place for the protection of water resources through the Clean Water Act (CWA) program for the Nonpoint Source Pollution program, which emphasizes improving water quality in degraded stream systems; the riparian program, which is concerned with maintenance and restoration of riparian zones both vegetatively and hydrologically; and the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act, which intends to reduce salt loading throughout the San Juan Basin. All three programs have parallel or similar goals, and accomplishments in any one usually are beneficial to the others. All water rights are acquired in accordance with state substantive and procedural law, except where Congress or the Executive Branch has created a federal reservation with a reserved water right. Federal reserved water rights are defined based on the Interior Solicitors' Opinion of June 25, 1979, as modified by Solicitor Coldiron's September 11, 1981, opinion. BLM's federal reserved water rights claims are primarily associated with the withdrawal established by the Executive Order (EO) of April 17, 1926, dealing with public water reserves, and the withdrawal for converted oil and gas wells under the Oil and Gas Well Conversion Act of June 6, 1934. Water quality regulations in the U.S. receive its basic authority from two laws. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended by the CWA of 1977, is the basic authority for instream water quality standards and maximum permissible pollution discharges. The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 is the basic authority for domestic water quality standards. The BLM's water resource program includes participation with the state and EPA in water quality management. Specifically, the BLM works to ensure that the management and development practices comply with state water quality standards. The hydrology program will continue to emphasize legislative mandates of protections,  maintenance, and enhancement of the resources, as well as provide support to other resource activities for the FFO. Policy and guidance for the management of water resources associated with lands administered by the BLM is summarized in Manual Sections 7000 and 7200.  Air Quality All BLM actions and use authorizations must comply with all applicable local, state, tribal, and federal air quality laws, statutes, regulations, standards, and implementation plans. Prior to implementation, all BLMinitiated or authorized activities within nonattainment areas must undergo a determination (when applicable) of conformity with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) according to the General Conformity Rule (40 CFR Part 93.150). If the NAAQS are being met, the area is designated as attainment, and if the status of attainment has not been verified through data collection, the area is unclassified. For permitting purposes, an unclassified area is treated as an attainment area. The counties in the planning area are classified as in attainment of all state and national ambient air quality standards. The New Mexico Air Quality Bureau (NMAQB) is responsible for enforcing the state and national ambient air quality standards in New Mexico. Any emission source proposed for the RMP would have to comply with the NMAQB regulations. For example, any new or modified stationary source that has the potential to emit more than 10 tons per year (TPY) of any regulated air contaminant or 1 TPY of lead has to file a notice of intent (NOI) prior to construction and thereafter submit annual emissions inventories. Proposed sources that emit more 10 pounds per hour or 25 TPY of any air pollutant for which there is a national or state ambient air quality standard would have to demonstrate that these emissions would not contribute to an exceedance of an ambient air quality standard or substantially degrade air quality within pristine federal Class I areas, such as National Parks greater than 6,000 acres or  2-11   CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  National Wilderness Areas (NWA) greater than 5,000 acres. Within the project region, these areas could include the San Pedro Parks NWA in New Mexico and the Mesa Verde National Park and Weminuche NWA in Colorado. For any proposed coal development associated with the RMP, increase in current extraction or use, the BLM would coordinate with all appropriate agencies of state, federal, and tribal governments to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. Project specific dispersion modeling and an environmental assessment will be prepared with the opportunity for public input. Air quality will be examined in conjunction with the NMAQB, following applicable permit procedures.  noxious weed control. The FFO has a one-week invasive plant workshop at San Juan College in July.  Inventoryensure that adequate baseline data are available on the distribution of weeds. Planninginclude provisions for noxious weed management in all BLM funded or authorized actions. Integrated Weed Managementdetermine the best methods for an integrated approach to weed management and implement on-the-ground operations. Coordinationensure management for noxious weeds is carried out efficiently and consistently across jurisdictional and political boundaries. San Juan County is in the process of forming a weed management team that consists of members from the BLM, San Juan County officials, Cities of Farmington, Aztec, and Bloomfield, BIA, and San Juan College.        Invasive Weed Management EO 11312, Invasive Species-1999, the Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974, the New Mexico Noxious Weed Management Act of 1978, and the Federal Plant Protection Act of 2000 require the development of a weed management program. This program focuses on the inventory of existing infestations, prevention of noxious weed invasion, monitoring revegetation efforts for invasive weeds, and assessment of the success of weed control efforts. The mission of the FFO is to detect new invasive plant species populations, prevent the spread of new invasive populations, manage existing populations using tools of integrated weed management, and eradicate invasive populations. This is accomplished when and where possible using the safest environmental methods available in a timely manner (Heil and White 2000). Prevention and management of invasive plants assists in improving the health of public lands. A plan developed for the FFO includes the following program procedures.  Prevention and Detectiondevelop a prevention and early detection program. Education and Awarenessgenerate internal and external support for  Monitoring, Evaluation, Research, and Technology Transferensure sufficient data are available to evaluate management actions, provide a basis for making informed decisions, assess progress towards management objectives, and develop new and more effective management methods. For all actions on public lands that involve surface disturbance or rehabilitation, reasonable steps would be required to prevent the introduction or spread of noxious weeds, including requirements for using weed seed-free hay, mulch, and straw.    Special Status Species Special status species are managed in accordance with BLM Manual 6840. The ESA (Public Law [PL] 93-205), as amended (PL 100-478), requires special protection and management for federally listed threatened and endangered (T&E) species, species proposed to be listed as T&E, and designated and proposed critical habitat. The act also requires the    2-12   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  development and implementation of recovery plans for the conservation and survival of T&E species. FFO activities to implement recovery plans are described in the Biological Assessment for the RMP/EIS (BLM 2002c). In accordance with BLM Manual 6840, BLM also manages a large number of sensitive, non-listed species to protect them and prevent the need to list them as threatened or endangered. The purpose of this management prior to federal listing is to use a broad range of management options to protect a species. Federal and state listed species are protected by requiring site-specific evaluations and clearances and by applying more stringent management prescriptions in areas that have been specially designated to protect target species. The FFO maintains a conflict map that identifies the location of listed species or potential habitat to guide any staff responsible for authorization of specific projects. When a proposed project falls within habitat that has been designated as having the potential to support a protected species, a field survey is required prior to authorization of the project. When a new threatened, endangered, or proposed species protected by the ESA is listed, any potential habitat for that species is added to the conflict map. Any action that may affect federally listed species also requires consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) under Section 7 of the ESA. Major legislation requiring actions by federal agencies to protect T&E species, as well as other protected, non-federally listed species and habitats, include the following:     Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1980 (PL 96-366). Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958 (PL 85-654). Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1976 (PL 94-576). Plant Protection Act of 2000 (PL 106224).  Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat The objectives of BLM's wildlife management program are to ensure optimum populations and a natural abundance and diversity of fish and wildlife values by restoring, maintaining, and enhancing habitat conditions (BLM 1987b). The objective of the FFO wildlife program is to maintain, improve, and expand wildlife habitat on public lands for both consumptive and non-consumptive uses. Wildlife management on BLM lands has emphasized the perpetuation of a biologically diverse plant and animal community. Priority wildlife management activities conducted in the FFO include big game management and bald eagle protection. The FFO is determining the numbers, habitat needs, and distribution of non-T&E bird species, including migratory songbirds. The protection and enhancement of wildlife habitat is accomplished through an aggressive program of habitat improvement projects, designation of SMAs with wildlife friendly management prescriptions, and the application of mitigation measures on key wildlife lands where oil and gas reserves are being developed. Stipulations on oil and gas activities are applied to mitigate the impacts on wildlife. The FFO administers a small amount of fisheries habitat on small, generally isolated tracts of public land mostly along the San Juan River. Legislation such as FLPMA, the ESA, and the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 provide direction to the BLM for improving wildlife habitat. It is the responsibility of the FFO to identify opportunities to maintain, improve, and expand wildlife habitat on the public lands. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) No. NMSO-41 between the BLM and the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish (NMDGF) provides for cooperative development of fish and wildlife resource plans. In addition to earlier Habitat Management Plans (HMP), in recent years the Rattlesnake Canyon and Crow Mesa HMPs were prepared. Implementation of these activity plans will continue and others will be developed as needed.  2-13   CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  Department of the Interior policy and the annual Animal Damage Control Plan for the Albuquerque District, prepared jointly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the BLM, guide animal damage control activities on public lands in the planning area. The USDA has overall responsibility for the program and supervises all control activities. The BLM has approval responsibility for the specific control actions on public lands.  Wilderness The objective of the FFO wilderness program is to protect and manage the WA and the WSA in accordance with appropriate laws and regulations. Currently, the FFO manages the 44,608-acre Bisti/De-na-zin WA and the 6,653-acre Ah-shi-sle-pah WSA. In 1996, Congress designated as wilderness approximately 16,525 acres located between the Bisti WA (3,946 acres) and the De-na-zin WA (24,137 acres). As a result, the Bisti and De-na-zin were combined to create one wilderness unit (PL 104-333). Management of the WA will be in accordance with the Bisti/Dena-zin Wilderness Expansion and Fossil Forest Protection Act of 1996 (PL 104-333), the San Juan Basin Wilderness Protection Act of 1984 (PL 98-603), the Wilderness Act of 1964 (PL 88-577), and BLM Wilderness Management Regulations (43 CFR 6300 and 8560). The Bisti/De-na-zin WA contains three previously designated ACECs: Badlands, Log Jam, and Lost Pine. These areas are required to be managed under the non-impairment standards of the Wilderness Act. Existing management plans prepared for both the Bisti and De-na-zin WAs are proposed to be replaced by one updated management plan that includes the newly acquired acreage. The Ah-shi-sle-pah WSA will be managed under the Interim Management Policy and Guidelines for Lands Under Wilderness Review until the area is either added to the National Wilderness Preservation System by Congress or removed from further consideration (BLM 1995c). The purpose of BLM's Interim Management Policy is to protect existing wilderness values, manage valid existing rights and grandfathered activities until final wilderness suitability determinations have been made. If designated wilderness, the area will be managed under the enabling legislation, the Wilderness Act of 1964, and BLM Wilderness Management Regulations (43 CFR 6300 and 8560). If released from further wilderness consideration, the area will be managed under  Riparian Under the BLM's multiple use management, a variety of activities, such as livestock grazing, timber harvest, mining, recreation, roads, and utility corridors, take place on public lands. These activities can affect the quality and health of riparian areas that are important to fish and wildlife. Recent management guidance is provided in the Riparian and Aquatic Habitat Management Plan (BLM 2000b, c). BLM guidance on the management of riparian areas has the objective of restoring and protecting those areas within the context of authorizing other land management activities. The goal of the FFO riparian monitoring plan is to document the progress toward achieving and then maintaining Proper Functioning Condition (PFC) while being managed under the multiple use and adaptive management concepts outlined in the Riparian and Aquatic Habitat Management Plan (BLM 2000b, c). Riparian and wetland areas are considered to be functioning properly when adequate vegetation, landform, or large woody debris are present to dissipate stream energy associated with high water flows, thereby reducing erosion and improving water quality. The process used to assess PFC is described in BLM Technical References 1737-9 and 173715. PFC is reassessed on a 3-year rotating basis. A binder containing monitoring information, such as PFC results, reassessment schedules, and photo-point monitoring photos, for each designated riparian reach is being compiled and maintained in the FFO.  2-14   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  the principles prescribed in the appropriate land use plan for the FFO. The New Mexico Wilderness Study Report (BLM 1991b) recognized the outstanding wilderness values found in the Ah-shi-sle-pah WSA. However, the report did not recommend the WSA for wilderness designation due to the known coal reserves, the existence of PRLAs on 90 percent of the WSA acreage, the anticipated likelihood of future mineral development, and the potential transfer of 3,094 acres in the WSA to the Navajo Tribe. Currently, no change in land ownership or surface disturbing activity has occurred in the area. However, the WSA would be difficult to manage as wilderness should the above conditions be realized. In the AFO, five WSAs lie either wholly or partially within the planning area. These include Cabezon, Empedrado, Ignacio Chavez, Chamisa, and La Lena WSAs, with a combined acreage of 70,475 acres. They have been closed to mineral leasing since 1982, but there are pre-existing leases that were issued before then (BLM 1991b).  Forestry The objective of the forestry program is to manage woodlands and timber stands for the production of forest products to support multiple uses and sustained yields. Multiple uses include recreation, timber sales, and harvesting of fuelwood. Timber sales are not active in the FFO area. Restoration projects focus on improving the 7,400 acres of ponderosa pine through cutting or burning the encroaching pion and juniper. The Material Disposal Act of 1947, as amended, establishes the authority under which the BLM disposes of timber and other forest products.  Fire Management The objective of the FFO fire program is to manage and use fire consistent with its natural role in the functioning ecosystem, and the protection of life and property. The Farmington Interagency Fire Program operates with the cooperation of the FFO and the Jicarilla Ranger District. The program  guidance is documented in the 2001 Farmington Field Office Fire Management Plan (BLM 2001a), which addresses all fuels management guidance and provides the basis for decisions regarding evaluation and response to wildfires. The plan adheres to the Federal Wildland Fire Policy (updated in 2000) and BLM Policy 92-13-1. All fire management activities must also comply with other federal regulations on wilderness management, T&E species protection, cultural and historic preservation, and air and water quality standards and guidance. During reclamation after a fire, a weed management plan is required. Lightning causes the majority of wildfires in the FFO area, with fires caused by people, either accidentally or intentionally, as the next major source. The increasing population in the tri-cities area has resulted in an increase in fires in the wildland/urban interface area. Fuel loadings in the urban areas are often moderate, with an occasional area of heavy fuel loadings. With the existing fuel loadings, a wind-driven fire in these areas under dry conditions could threaten structures. Areas containing high fuel loadings, such as cottonwood trees, willows, saltcedar, and alkali sacaton, are usually located on private land. There have been no known fires in either of the WAs during the past 10 years due to the predominance of badlands with little vegetation and scattered stands of sagebrush and grass. The FFO has agreed to suppress fires on approximately 1.5 million acres of public land, 300,000 acres on USFS land, and, under the Joint Powers Agreement, on another 700,000 acres of private, state, and Indian lands where fires may occur and pose a threat to the public land.  Rangeland The objective of the rangeland program is to promote healthy sustainable rangeland ecosystems; to accelerate restoration and improvement of public rangeland to properly functioning condition; to promote the orderly use, improvement, and development of the  2-15   CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  public lands; to efficiently and effectively administer domestic livestock grazing; and to provide for the sustainability of the western livestock industry and communities that are dependent upon productive, healthy public rangelands. The program cares for and is working toward improving the overall health of all public lands within the BLM's responsibility. The livestock grazing program is authorized principally by FLPMA, the Taylor Grazing Act of 1937, and the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978. When grazing allotments are planned for disposal, the BLM is required to provide notification to permittees two years in advance. Three major parts of the program are grazing administration, resource inventory and monitoring, and range improvement. Grazing administration consists of issuing and supervising permits and leases that authorize livestock grazing. Related tasks include detecting and abating unauthorized use and supervising allotments. Analyses of resource monitoring and inventory information is used to evaluate and adjust grazing use. Range improvement helps enhance rangeland resource conditions for a variety of uses, including domestic livestock and wildlife forage and watershed protection. Public rangeland will be managed to meet the Standards for Public Land Health (BLM 2000a). If the Standards are not met, the Livestock Grazing Management guidelines offer tools to guide the FFO to improve those areas not meeting the Standards. Guidelines are reasonable and practical management options, which when applied, move rangelands toward the statewide standards. The guidelines are developed for public land livestock grazing, not for unsuitable land or land where livestock grazing does not occur. They are based on science, past and present management experience, and public input. These guidelines will be used to develop grazing management practices that will be implemented at the watershed, allotment, or pasture level. Specific application of these guidelines, or Livestock Grazing Management Practices, occur  at the field office level, in consultation, cooperation, and coordination with lessees, permittees, interested public, and landowners. Their implementation is carried out with recognition for the impact that BLM's management objectives have on adjacent landowners. Guidelines are designed to encourage innovation and experimentation in the development of alternative livestock grazing management practices. They improve rangeland health and consider the natural migration patterns of wildlife. The goals of the Livestock Grazing Management Practices are summarized below.  Promote native plant health, soil stability, microorganisms, water quality, stream channel morphology, function and habitat for native wildlife including threatened and endangered and special status species. Provide the basic requirements of rangeland ecological sites, including allowing for plant recovery and growth; allowing residual vegetation on upland and riparian sites to protect the soil from wind and water erosion, improve infiltration, and improve soil permeability; and improve or restore riparianwetland functions. Use livestock to integrate organic matter into the soil, distribute seeds and establish seedings, prune vegetation to stimulate growth, and enhance water infiltration into the soil. Allow for flexibility in season, duration, frequency, and intensity of use. Consider climate topography, vegetation, wildlife, kind and class of livestock. Give priority to rangeland improvements and land treatments that offer the best opportunity for achieving standards of rangeland health. Incorporate the use of other land management practices where needed to achieve the desired plant community,            2-16   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  including, but not limited to prescribed fire, and biological, mechanical, and chemical land treatments.  Use non-native plant species only in those situations where native species are not readily available or are incapable of maintaining or achieving properly functioning conditions and biological health.  Cultural Resources The BLM's Cultural Resource Management Program is a comprehensive system for identifying, planning the appropriate use of, and managing cultural resources on public lands within areas of BLM responsibility. The program objectives are as follows:  Respond in a legally and professionally adequate manner to (1) the statutory authorities concerning historic preservation and cultural resource protection, and (2) the principles of multiple use. Recognize the potential public and scientific uses of, and the values attributed to, cultural resources on the public lands, and manage the lands and cultural resources so that these uses and values are not diminished, but rather are maintained and enhanced. Contribute to land use planning and the multiple use management of the public lands in ways that make optimum use of the thousands of years of land use history inherent in cultural resource information, and that safeguard opportunities for attaining appropriate uses of cultural resources. Protect and preserve in place representative examples of the full array of cultural resources on public lands for the benefit of scientific and public use by present and future generations. Ensure that proposed land uses, initiated or authorized by BLM, avoid inadvertent damage to federal and non-federal cultural resources.  These program objectives are carried out through two program components: protection and utilization. The protection component is concerned with safeguarding and maintaining cultural resources for the public. Included are proactive management activities such as physical protection, preservation, and interpretation of cultural resources along with public education. The protection component is also concerned with support to other activities so that the management and development of public lands can proceed in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. The utilization component is concerned with scientific research and collection management. Specific legal requirements, which the BLM and other federal agency cultural resource management programs operate under to meet the program objectives, include:  American Antiquities Act of 1906 59-209; 34 Stat. 225; 16 USC 433). The act is implemented uniform regulations at 43 CFR Part (PL 432, by 3.      Recreation and Public Purposes Act of 1926 (PL 69-386; 44 Stat. 741; 43 USC 869).

In addition, the Farmington and Albuquerque Field Offices manage specific Chacoan outliers, as directed, in:  New Mexico Wilderness Act of 1980 (PL 96-550; Title V; ""Chaco Culture National Historic Park""; Sec. 501-508.          Chacoan Outliers Protection Act of 1995 (PL 104-11). The BLM cultural program operates under a national programmatic agreement with the ACHP and State Historic Preservation Officers. As part of the agreement, a Preservation Board was established. Implementation of the agreement in New Mexico is through a protocol agreement with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). Relevant documents include:  Programmatic Agreement among the BLM, the ACHP, and the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers regarding the manner in which BLM will meet its responsibilities under the NHPA (1997).

Resource Cultural Cultural Cultural      8160 Manual--Native American Coordination and Consultation. Specific BLM cultural resource program guidance for the public lands under the  2-18   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  responsibility of the New Mexico State Office is provided in the Handbook H-8100-1, Procedures for Performing Cultural Resources Field Work on Public Lands in the Area of New Mexico State BLM Responsibility (2002).  Inventory Public lands administered by the BLM are inventoried for cultural resources while implementing both program components. For example, as part of the proactive cultural resources program, areas may be inventoried while implementing a cultural resource management plan, or to investigate areas where data is lacking and to identify at-risk cultural resources. Lands are inventoried to meet the legal requirements of taking into account the effect of a federal undertaking on cultural resources. All inventories and site recording are conducted under the guidance and standards found in Handbook H-8100-1. The Albuquerque and Farmington Field Offices each maintain copies of the investigative records prepared for cultural resources associated with federal undertakings that they have responsibility, and this contributes to the utilization component of the program. This information, coupled with base maps showing the location of recorded sites and inventoried areas, is used to guide agency decisions regarding appropriate utilization of the resources. The BLM also contributes to the maintenance of an archaeological computer data base sponsored by the Archaeological Records Management Section of the New Mexico Historic Preservation Division. Sites recorded on public lands make up a majority of the sites on record at the Laboratory of Anthropology, and contribute significantly to the historical and scientific research being conducted throughout New Mexico.  Concern RMP Amendment (BLM 1998b) designated 44 ACECs, two of which had been previously designated as SMAs in the earlier RMP. The primary purpose of ACEC and SMA designation of cultural resources is to provide special management attention to protect and prevent irreparable damage to important historic and cultural values. Special management prescriptions affect the kinds of discretionary and non-discretionary actions at ACECs or SMAs. Management objectives for the existing ACECs or SMAs are predominantly protection and preservation of the cultural values, with some areas identified for protection of both the cultural and recreational values.  Special Designations National Register of Historic Places The NRHP is the nation's official list of properties (districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects) that are significant in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, and culture. NRHP properties in the planning area are prehistoric, proto-historic, and historic, representing a variety of cultural groups occupying the San Juan Basin and adjacent areas. Prehistoric and proto-historic properties within the planning area that are currently listed on the NRHP are under a variety of ownership and management jurisdictions. Cultures represented on the list include Archaic, Anasazi, and Navajo. The NRHP properties dating post1800 are primarily within towns, not on public land. State of New Mexico Register of Historic Places The New Mexico Historic Preservation Division maintains a list of cultural resources that meet guidelines as being important to the prehistory and history of the state. All of the sites on the NRHP are also listed on the State Register of Historic Places (SRHP). Five BLM Chaco protection sites are listed on the SRHP but are not yet listed on the NRHP.  Planning Cultural resources can be identified as ACECs or SMAs in RMPs or amendments. In the Farmington RMP (BLM 1988), 41 areas were designated as ACECs or SMAs, one of which has since been deleted. The Cultural Resource Areas of Critical Environmental  2-19   CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  Chaco Culture Archaeological Protection Sites Public Law 96-550, Title V Chaco Culture National Historical Park, Section 501-508 of the New Mexico Wilderness Act of 1980 designated 33 Chacoan outliers as Chaco Culture Archaeological Protection Sites (Protection Sites) and Chaco Canyon National Monument as Chaco Culture National Historic Park. The purpose of the title was ""to recognize the unique archaeological resources associated with the prehistoric Chacoan culture in the San Juan Basin; to provide for the preservation and interpretation of these resources; and to facilitate research activities associated with these resources [Sec. 501(b)]."" Four BLM sites were included. The BLM was also directed to monitor three privately owned sites and seek a cooperative arrangement with the owners. The remaining sites were on Indian allotted, Navajo Reservation and fee, and Ute Mountain Ute lands. In 1991, five Navajo fee Protection Sites were transferred to the BLM through a land exchange and one was acquired by the BLM through a combination exchange/purchase. The need to amend PL 96-550, to add additional Protection Sites, adjust boundaries of existing Protection Sites and to delete Squaw Springs at the request of the Ute Mountain Utes, was identified. As a result, the Chacoan Outliers Protection Act of 1995 (PL 104-11) deleted two and added eight new Protection Sites including three on BLM land. World Heritage List Natural and cultural resources throughout the world that are of international importance may be designated as World Heritage Sites by inclusion on the World Heritage List maintained by United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Five BLM Chacoan outliers designated as Chaco Culture Archaeological Protection Sites in 1980 were included with Chaco Canyon as a World Heritage Site in 1987.  Protection and Utilization The objectives of the BLM cultural resource management program protection component ""are aimed towards protecting the significance of cultural resources by ensuring that they are managed in a manner suited to the characteristics, attributes, and uses that contribute to their public importance; towards giving adequate consideration to the effects of BLM land use decisions on cultural properties; towards meeting legal and regulatory obligations through a system of compliance fitted to BLM's management system, and towards ensuring that the cultural resources on public land are safeguarded from improper use and responsibly maintained in the public interest"" (BLM Manual 8120  Protecting Cultural Resources). The major emphasis of the BLM's cultural resource management program objectives involves the protection, preservation, and enhancement of the cultural resources for present and future generations. Both administrative and physical measures are undertaken to ensure these objectives are met. Special designation administrative measures may include determination of eligibility for listing on the NRHP and/or UNESCO World Heritage List, designation as ACECs, or designation as a National Historic Landmark. Cultural resources may also be considered for special designation through Public Law (e.g., Chaco outliers). Other administrative measures include limiting multiple use activities that may impact cultural resources. Some of the measures which may be taken are mineral withdrawals, road closures, closing to grazing, closing or restricting specific uses to previously disturbed areas, OHV designations and public education. Physical protection measures consist of activities such as stabilization, monitoring of site condition, patrol and surveillance programs, signing, and fencing. The emphasis of site protection activities has been on the identification and proactive management of a wide variety of site types. Many of these sites have been designated as ACECs and SMAs. A major focus of the protection program has been implementation of  2-20   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  PL 96-550 and PL 104-11. Both administrative and physical protection measures have been undertaken to ensure the long-term preservation of the Chacoan outliers designated as Chaco Culture Archaeological Sites in these laws. In addition to the Chacoan outliers, other Anasazi sites, early Navajo, and historic sites are being actively protected. A stabilization program was established in the mid-1970s and remains an active program. Since then the architecture of 24 Navajo pueblitos and six Chacoan outliers has been documented and stabilized, including emergency stabilization at one historic homestead site. An active Site Steward Program is an important aspect of the FFO site protection program. The Site Protection Action List  Farmington Field Office was prepared to identify and establish specific management prescriptions to protect at-risk cultural sites. Specifically, the plan established a Site Protection Plan, identified management actions to protect site integrity from visitor use and deficiency in survey coverage, and assessed stabilization needs of the ACECs or SMAs. Cultural inventory (survey) to identify at-risk and other cultural sites is part of the cultural resource program responsibility under Section 110 of the NHPA, as amended, and to implement management prescriptions identified during ACEC and SMA designation. These inventories are considered part of the program's proactive protection component rather than inventories required to meet Section 106 requirements. The objectives of the BLM cultural resource program's utilization component ""are to facilitate appropriate scientific use of cultural properties on public lands; to ensure that collections of archaeological materials removed from public lands and records relating to them are maintained in qualified public repositories as U.S. property and are used for appropriate research or educational purposes; and to ensure that the public receives tangible benefits from all uses of public land cultural resources"" (BLM 8130 ManualUtilizing Cultural Resources for Public Benefit). Use Category  Designations are an assessment by BLM of the appropriate use that a cultural property may be subjected to and is a mechanism for assisting management in making decisions about land use. Use categories include scientific use, conservation for future use, traditional use, public use, experimental use, and discharge from management. Currently within the FFO, no sites are specifically allocated for experimental use or for discharge from management. Sites that may not be eligible for the NRHP, a significant benchmark for evaluating significance and guiding management decisions, are often disturbed or destroyed during construction. Those that are not destroyed are not otherwise actively managed, but they are not formally discharged from management. Within the FFO, approximately 20 percent or less of the sites documented in any given year are not considered significant. Three sites have been specifically allocated for traditional use: Cho'li'i, Huerfano Mesa, and Salt Point. All three are also specially designated as ACECs or SMAs. Numerous sites and landscape features are known or suspected to have traditional use, but they have not been specially allocated for such. Sites allocated for public use include one Chacoan outlier, eight Navajo pueblitos, one Navajo rock art site, four historic homesteading era sites, and one homesteading era schoolhouse. Fifteen Chacoan outlier sites and three Chaco road sites are allocated for conservation for future use. These sites are currently designated as ACECs or SMAs. The remainder of the sites (more than 8,000) is allocated for scientific use. When use warrants, the BLM issues permits to appropriate, qualified non-federal applicants for survey and recording, and for excavation and/or removal. In addition permits may be granted for limited testing and/or removal. Within the FFO the majority of the permits are issued to meet Section 106 compliance and are associated with oil and gas field development and transportation.  2-21   CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  Compliance One of the objectives of the protection component of the cultural resources program involves compliance with numerous federal legal and regulatory obligations. Taking into account the effect of federal undertakings (actions or authorizations) on cultural resources is mandated by Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended. Section 106 of the act is implemented by regulations of the ACHP, 36 CFR Part 800. The New Mexico BLM cultural resource program operates under the provisions of a 1997 National Programmatic Agreement among the BLM, the ACHP, and the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, and a 1998 Protocol Agreement between New Mexico BLM and New Mexico State Historic Preservation Officer. These agreements recognize the cultural resources expertise that BLM has in its professional staff and as a result, have significantly streamlined the manner in which the BLM meets its responsibilities under the NHPA, and has reduced the often time consuming project by project consultation that had been historically required in compliance with Section 106. Although these agreement documents have greatly streamlined the BLM interaction with SHPO and the ACHP, the BLM still has significant and ongoing consultation obligations and responsibilities with Native American tribes, local and state governments, other federal agencies, and interested groups and individuals. Much of the workload of the cultural resource staff involves ensuring that federal undertakings associated with but not limited to oil and gas development, extraction and transportation are in compliance with Section 106 and other applicable preservation laws and regulations. Over 1,000 undertakings are reviewed each year, ranging from a single well pad to major pipeline gathering systems. The BLM's policy has been to prevent impacts by planning the undertaking to avoid cultural resources, however since the ""boom"" of Fruitland coal gas development in the early  1990s avoidance has not always been possible or recommended due to other constraints. If impacts to the cultural resources cannot be avoided, mitigation of the effect is conducted prior to approval of the undertaking or required as a stipulation on the approval. A wide range of measures is used to avoid or mitigate impacts on cultural resources. Measures commonly used include project relocation or redesign, fencing and barriers, monitoring of construction activities and site condition, and data recovery. Most protective measures are attached to the undertaking (APD, ROW, etc.) as stipulations (COAs).  Program Direction Protection and Preservation Cultural resources are a finite, nonrenewable resource, which require protection and preservation to ensure their existence for future generations to learn from and appreciate. These resources are the cultural heritage of all Americans and warrant pro-active management. The major protection and preservation measure has been the designation of cultural resources as ACECs and SMAs. Management prescriptions have been implemented through several programs including patrol and surveillance, monitoring, and stabilization. The patrol and surveillance program has been expanded through the use of volunteer Site Stewards who also serve as educational points of contact with visitors in the fields. The involvement of the public in the management of cultural resources is an emphasis of the cultural program and will continue. Also emphasized is the role of law enforcement in the protection of cultural resources. A stabilization program was begun in the mid-1970s that provides for long-term preservation of significant standing architecture. Stabilization of 24 pueblitos and six Chacoan outliers has been conducted. Stabilization of other prehistoric and historic sites and maintenance of previously stabilized sites will continue. Prior to stabilization the structures are recorded through Historic American Building  2-22   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Survey (HABS) or other detailed methods of documentation. Public Use Several objectives of the BLM Cultural Resources Management Program are concerned with the management of cultural resources for public use by present and future generations. A variety of public uses are possible. The most visible public use is recreational and educational site visitation. The American public along with others are keenly interested in both the prehistory and history of the San Juan Basin. Visitation to BLM administered sites continues to increase each year. Eight pueblitos, one petroglyph site and one Chacoan outlier have been prepared for recreational public visitation in the FFO. A large format interpretive brochure and map has been prepared to direct the public to the pueblitos and petroglyph site. Management prescriptions for four homesteads and a school house identified as ACECs in 1998 include preparing of the sites for public visitation and interpretation. Actions proposed to be undertaken as part of the preparation of these sites for public visitation will include gathering of information on the historic occupation of the upper Largo Canyon area with an emphasis on the ACECs and the associated community. In addition to researching the history of human occupation of the ACECs, HABS documentation of the structures will be conducted followed by stabilization. Visitor facilities such as parking areas and trails will be constructed along with signing of the sites and preparation of interpretive brochures. Other ACECs or SMAs and possibly additional sites may be identified and prepared for future visitor use. Research The most obvious cultural resources managed by the BLM are the physical remains of past human occupation, such as artifacts, hearths, trails and roads, structures, and rock art. In addition to physical remains the BLM is responsible for the management of areas of traditional and sacred use by Native Americans.  When appropriate to the utilization designations of the resource, the BLM encourages research. Such research may include broad surveys, photographic documentation and analysis, collections of artifact specimens, and in some cases excavation. Other research methods, such as the collection of oral histories, may also be necessary to preserve information that is seldom reflected or recognizable in the archaeological record. Additional research is needed to help answer questions necessary for the development of best management practices and visitor uses. Areas of research concern vary; however, the Fruitland Coal Gas Data Recovery Project research design identified many of the basic archaeological concerns for prehistoric and protohistoric sites. Other research concerns for archaeological values include understanding the function of the Chacoan system, pueblito and historic sites architecture, the nature and function of rock art, and site preservation methods.  Tribal Consultation Responsibilities The BLM, USFS, and USBR all work in cooperation with the Native American tribes and the BIA to coordinate and consult before making decisions or approving actions that could result in changes in land use, physical changes to lands or resources, changes in access, or alienation of lands. FLPMA requires coordination with tribes in preparing and maintaining inventories of the public lands and determining their various resource and other values; in developing and maintaining longrange plans providing for the use of the public lands; and in managing the public lands. Federal programs are required to be carried out in a manner sensitive to Native American concerns and tribal government planning and resource management programs.  Paleontology Paleontological resources are managed on public lands because they are nonrenewable resources of value to scientists, educators,  2-23   CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  hobbyists, commercial collectors, and other members of the public. Without protection, the resources may be intentionally or unintentionally damaged or destroyed, causing valuable information to be lost. Paleontological resource protection objectives include facilitating research and collection on public lands, use for education and recreation, protecting scientifically valuable resources that may be in conflict with other land and resource uses, and protecting scientifically valuable fossils, as required by law. The paleontology program achieves these objectives through the following activities (BLM 1987a):  Identifying and evaluat cal resources so adequately addressed environmental analysis ing paleontologithey may be in planning and documents.     Maintaining and conducting an effective and continuing protection program. Increasing the awareness of federal land managers and the public regarding the significance of paleontological resources and management requirements, and encouraging public participation in resource management. Developing volunteer or cooperative management agreements and associations with individuals, professional paleontologists, local organizations and governments, and the scientific community. Avoiding or mitigating impacts to valuable paleontological resources. Avoiding publicizing the exact locations of scientifically significant paleontological resources if such attention would conflict with management objectives. Managing and issuing collection permits when appropriate. the FFO outdoor ensure the continued for a diverse array of nt outdoor recreation       opportunities. Recreation use is managed to protect the health and safety of visitors; to protect natural, cultural, and other resource values; to stimulate enjoyment of public lands; and to resolve user conflicts. Visitor demands and new recreation uses and opportunities will continue to influence how and what recreational opportunities are provided in the FFO area. FLPMA provides for management of outdoor recreation on public lands. Section 202(c)(9) calls for land use planning consistent with statewide outdoor recreation plans. Other national laws that govern recreation management in the FFO area include the National Trails System Act of 1968, as amended; the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1964, as amended; the R&PP Act, as amended; and the Wilderness Act of 1964. Most public lands are managed to maintain a freedom of recreational choice with a minimum of regulatory constraints. Few BLM recreational facilities or supervisory efforts exist on these lands, which are sometimes referred to as Extensive Recreation Management Areas. Where the nature of the resource attracts intensive recreational use, public lands may be managed as a SRMA. These are areas where the BLM makes major investments in recreational facilities and visitor assistance. Specific management direction in a SRMA is formulated by the BLM to provide for resource protection and public health, safety, and enjoyment.  Developed Recreation Developed sites and areas are places that contain structures or capital improvements primarily used by the public for recreation purposes. These sites may include such things as delineated spaces for parking, camping, or boat launching; sanitary facilities; potable water, grills or fire rings; tables; or controlled access. Detailed management direction is provided through Recreation Area Management Plans for Simon Canyon Recreation Area and ACEC, the Dunes Vehicle Recreation Area, and the Glade    Recreation The objective of recreation program is to availability of public land quality resource-depende  2-24   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Run Trail System (GRTS) Recreation Area. The Farmington RMP (BLM 1988) provides general management direction for Angel Peak Recreation Area and ACEC and Head Canyon OHV Competition Area.  Special Recreation Permits The FFO issues Special Recreation Permits (SRP) to authorize certain recreational uses of lands administered by the BLM. Authority to issue SRPs is provided in CFR Title 43, Part 8370. Permits are issued for competitive events, commercial events, and educational use. Commercial use is recreational use of public lands for business or financial gain. Competitive use is any formally organized or structured use, event, or activity on public land in which there are the elements of competition between two or more contestants, registration of participants, and/or a predetermined course or area is designated. Competitive use also includes individuals contesting an established record such as speed or endurance. Educational use is an academic activity sponsored by an accredited institution of learning. The FFO issues permits for a range of recreational activities annually. These include commercial guide services, hunting guides, competitive events (i.e., mountain bike races, OHV rock crawling events, motocross races, equestrian events), special large group events, and educational activities. The increase in demand for these activities influences how the BLM plans for future recreational needs. It is anticipated that recreational activity will continue to grow in the FFO area and that the BLM will strive to meet the demand.  Dispersed Recreation Current management direction for dispersed recreation opportunities is provided for in the CFR (Title 43, Part 8300) and BLM manuals. The Farmington RMP provides general management direction for Thomas Canyon SMA, Carracas Mesa SMA, and Negro Canyon SMA. Detailed direction for primitive and unconfined types of recreation can be found in management plans for the Bisti and De-na-zin WAs. The two management plans will be replaced by one updated management plan, including the additional acreage added to the WA. Recreation opportunities in the WSA will be managed under BLM's Interim Wilderness Management Policy and Guidelines for Lands Under Wilderness Review.  Recreation Opportunity System The outdoor recreation program uses the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) as the basic tool for inventory and management to ensure the general public a continued variety of quality recreational opportunities. Providing opportunities for backcountry recreation and more developed types of recreation close to major urban areas is emphasized. An effort is made to locate and establish use areas and trails compatible with social and natural environments in close proximity to heavily populated areas. A broad range of outdoor recreation opportunities such as backpacking, camping, sightseeing, fishing, boating, picnicking, horseback riding, wildlife viewing, OHV use, mountain biking, and motorcycling is provided for, in an attempt to meet varying public needs. Access is maintained and developed, where necessary, to enhance recreation opportunities and allow public use. Currently, five recreation SMAs have ROS class management objectives in the management prescriptions.  Off-Highway Vehicle Use 43 CFR 8340 provides for OHV use as a legitimate activity on public land wherever it is compatible with other resource management objectives. OHV designations are administrative, allowing management flexibility in response to changes in the environment. All public land is designated as ""open,"" ""limited,"" or ""closed"" to motorized vehicles. These designations are made in RMPs for public lands in each field office. The designations provide for the following uses:  Open Area: Areas on public land where OHVs may be operated, subject to the conditions set forth in 43 CFR 8341  2-25   CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  through 8343. Open designations generally include areas where there are no compelling resource protection needs, use conflicts, or public safety issues that would warrant limiting OHV use.  Limited Area: Areas on public land where OHVs may be restricted at certain times, in certain areas, and/or to certain vehicular use. These restrictions may be of any type, including the following categories: number of vehicles; types of vehicles; time or season of vehicle use; permitted or licensed use only; use on maintained roads and trails; use on designated road and trails; and other restrictions. Limitations may be used to meet specific resource management objectives, protect resources or public safety.  Closed Area: Areas on public land where OHV use is prohibited. Closures may be necessary to protect resources, ensure visitor safety, or reduce use conflicts. Emergency OHV limitations of use, and closure of areas and trails to OHV use, can occur under the authority of 43 CFR 8341.2. However, emergency closures are not OHV designations. Emergency closures can be done on a case-by-case basis to prevent or stop unnecessary degradation of resources or adverse effects to other authorized uses. Emergency closures remain in effect only until an interim or standard designation can be made, or until the adverse effects are eliminated and measures to prevent their recurrence have been implemented. OHV use has increased substantially in the FFO over the last decade and is an increasing concern for all resource programs. The outdoor recreation program is concerned with providing access to recreational areas and opportunities in appropriate settings for OHV activities without degrading the intrinsic qualities of the landscape that are important for a range of public land resource values. BLM is also    concerned with providing adequate access to resources and facilities on federal land. The FFO has designated 13 OHV Management Units for 499,040 acres of the field office. A plan has been developed for one unit to limit OHV use on 40,960 acres of public land. SMAs, ACECs, RNAs, WAs, and WSAs also have OHV use designations. The remainder of the public lands within the FFO is currently designated as ""open,"" allowing crosscountry travel in vehicles. The FFO will continue to apply OHV designations in order to provide for resource protection, access, and recreational use. It is difficult to provide one definition of motorized wheeled cross-country travel and have that definition fit all the situations that might occur. Roads and trails appear differently to individuals because of the variety of terrain, vegetation and soil type found in the FFO. Cross-country travel is wheeled motorized travel by any vehicle, recreational or other, off of roads and trails. The following examples further clarify this definition. Motorized travel is considered cross-country when:  The passage of motorized vehicles depresses undisturbed ground and crushes vegetation. The motorized vehicle maximum width (the distance from the outside of the left tire to the outside of the right tire or maximum tire width for motorcycles) does not easily fit the road or trail profile. However, an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) traveling within a two-track route established by a pickup truck is not considered cross-country travel.    Motorized vehicles use livestock and game trails, unless the trails are clearly evident, or continuous single-track routes used by motorcycles over a period of years. Motorized travel is not considered crosscountry when:    2-26   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE    Motorized vehicles use constructed roads that are maintained by the oil and gas industry and/or the BLM, unless specifically closed to use through signing and/or gates. Constructed roads are often characterized by a road prism with cut and fill slopes. Motorized vehicles use trails specifically designated for the vehicle being used. For example, this would include the single-track trails within SDAs that are designed for motorcycles. Motorized vehicles use clearly evident two-track and single-track routes with regular use and continuous passage of motorized vehicles over a period of years. A route is a track where perennial vegetation is devoid or scarce, or where wheel tracks are continuous depressions in the ground, evident to the casual observer, but are vegetated.      support of resource management objectives. The Field Office Ranger's responsibilities include criminal investigations, response to public complaint, surveillance, and patrols of sensitive areas. The law enforcement activities are conducted in accordance with U.S. Department of the Interior (USDI) and BLM manuals, regulations, and policies. The BLM Law Enforcement Program works cooperatively with other agencies in the Four Corners Area including the New Mexico State Police, San Juan County Sheriff's Office, Farmington Police Department, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, Drug Enforcement Administration, Area II Narcotics Enforcement, Chaco Culture National Historic Park, and the Civil Air Patrol. There are seven areas of emphasis for the Law Enforcement Program in the planning area: 1. Oil and GasThere are approximately 18,000 producing wells within the planning area. Activity focuses on the support of the Petroleum Engineering Technicians on the theft of product, vandalism to facilities and equipment, and compliance checks. 2. Cultural ResourcesThere are many significant cultural resources in the planning area that are accessible through the road network. Theft and vandalism of these resources are constant threats. Support includes patrol, surveillance, and cooperative information sharing on suspected criminal activity. FFO's law enforcement program is also involved in the investigation of illegal activities and the arrest and prosecution of those caught doing illegal activities. 3. Paleontological ResourcesWithin the planning area, there are pockets of dense, high quality fossil items. Both the Bisti and De-na-zin WAs were specifically designed to protect these resources and provide for orderly, scientific investigations. Support focuses  Travel is within a dry wash or arroyo that is as wide as the motorized vehicle's maximum width and there are no other resource concerns such as riparian areas or springs. The entire route must meet the above specifications. Newly created routes should be easily identified as not meeting the specifications because many portions would not show signs of regular and continuous passage of motorized vehicles and many areas would still be fully vegetated with no wheel depressions. This definition does have some ambiguity that will continue to exist until formal designation of routes, trails, and areas within the OHV Activity Plans is completed. This definition only applies to cross-country travel in the dispersed area and not to cross-country travel within the SDAs and ACECs. An SDA or ACEC may have its own management plan that defines cross-country travel within its boundaries.    Law Enforcement The FFO Field Office Ranger works closely with the Field Manager to prioritize actions in  2-27   CHAPTER 2--CONTINUING MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  on extended patrols of risk areas and recruiting volunteers to assist in providing coverage. 4. Controlled SubstancesControlled substance trafficking, production, cultivation, and use occur within the planning area. Law Enforcement efforts focus on maintaining visibility to deter illegal substance activity on the public lands, while continuing close coordination with other law enforcement organizations within the planning area. 5. Vegetation TheftThe illegal cutting and removal of woodland products continues to increase in the planning area. This activity is seasonal with demand increasing in the fall. The cutting and vehicle traffic associated with removal damages soil, plants, and wildlife habitats. The theft of plants from the designated SMAs for the Knowlton's and Mesa Verde cacti threatens these endangered species. Law enforcement efforts focus on prevention through education and permitting, patrols, and public support in reporting illegal activity.  6. Employee SafetyResource specialists work in remote areas, and law enforcement supports safe operations in isolated areas through direct support, overflight safety checks, and provision of safety information and equipment. With awareness of any potential threat of interference, the Law Enforcement Ranger will accompany resource specialists to the field. 7. RecreationThere are numerous and varied outdoor recreation opportunities and activities occurring on the public lands within the planning area, including rafting, swimming, fishing, hunting, horseback riding, mountain biking, backpacking, bird watching, rockhounding, vehicle camping, and OHV use. Law enforcement assists the recreating public with information on special areas, permitting, opportunities, access, and land status. Support focuses on patrol of developed sites, visitor information and education, and coordination with other agencies during special events.  2-28   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVES  ALTER  NATIVES  This section describes the alternatives considered in detail for meeting the purpose and need for the proposed revision to the Farmington RMP. These alternatives were selected based on the following criteria:  Provide for maximum practicable recovery of oil and gas resources in the planning area. Comprehensively address and incorporate previously approved real estate and land management actions in the FFO area. Provide a complete and adequate RMP for the FFO area. Adequately protect sensitive resources and the environment.        Provide a reasonable range of management options for the FFO. Application of these criteria resulted in the identification of three action alternatives for detailed analysis, in addition to the no action alternative. Alternatives considered but not carried forward for detailed analysis are discussed at the end of the chapter.  Overview The alternatives described in this section define a range of land use management options. Alternative A is no action, in which management would remain under current RMP documents and policies. This alternative is required by Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations and provides a basis of comparison for the other alternatives. Alternative B emphasizes maximum recovery of the hydrocarbon resources as the primary goal. Alternative C emphasizes conservation, protection, and enhancement of natural and cultural resources through special management of designated areas. Alternative D balances the two goals to achieve maximum practicable recovery of oil and gas, while also maximizing protection of the most sensitive environmental resources.  Each alternative addresses oil and gas leasing and development for BLM, USFS, and USBR lands in the planning area, and comprehensive resource management for BLM lands only. The alternatives differ primarily in the boundaries of some special management designations and in management prescriptions. In general, there are more acres of special management designations and the management prescriptions are more stringent under Alternative C, compared to Alternatives A, B, and D. The section on Alternative A describes current practices. The sections on Alternatives B, C, and D describe changes in stipulations, special management designations, management prescriptions, and other actions compared to Alternative A. The Continuing Management Guidance would remain in effect under all alternatives. Since the 1988 RMP and later amendments for the FFO area were completed, the BLM has been converting land management information from paper maps into electronic Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This includes data such as special management designation boundaries, wells, roads, range allotments, and watershed boundaries. For each alternative, the GIS data were used to generate the acreage of each special management designation, oil and gas lease, and the amount of land affected by constraints on oil and gas activities. GIS data were also used to determine the number of existing and projected wells within those boundaries for each alternative. These calculations differ in some cases from acreages listed in previous RMP documents due to such factors as digitizing error, different projections, or other factors. These differences are identified in the Specially Designated Areas section of Alternative A. For this EIS, the GIS-calculated acreages were used for analysis and discussion of all alternatives to provide a consistent basis for comparison. Each of the alternative descriptions in the following sections address how the alternative would affect the following:  2-29   CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVES  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  1. Oil and gas leasing and development. 2. Modification of BLM ownership patterns and ROW corridor designations. 3. Modification and addition of areas with special administrative designation. 4. OHV designations of open, closed, limited. 5. Identification of additional coal leasing areas to meet anticipated production needs for the next 15 to 20 years. Most of the limitations on land use would be applied through management prescriptions within SDAs or USBR land around Navajo Reservoir. The boundaries of many of the SDAs overlap other areas, with differing management prescriptions described in these overlapping areas. To determine the acreage under each management constraint, the most limiting  constraint was applied in overlapping areas and that acreage was tallied and excluded from the acreage of the less limiting constraint. The total acreage of public land or federal minerals listed for the identified constraints under each alternative does not double-count the overlapping acreage. Under Alternative D for example, Cho'li'i (Gobernador Knob) is a cultural ACEC with NSO constraints on oil and gas development whose boundary overlaps Gobernador and Cereza Canyon Fossil Area that has CSU constraints. The acreage of Cho'li'i has been added to the total acreage of NSO constraints under Alternative D, and this acreage has been subtracted from the acreage of CSU constraints. For this reason, totaling the acreage of each SDA under the same constraint will not result in the total acreage listed under each alternative.  2-30   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE A  Alternative A Under this alternative, the FFO would continue to manage oil and gas leasing and other resource responsibilities as it does currently. Management guidance, implementation procedures, and special management designations would remain as they currently exist under the 1988 RMP, the 1991 Amendment for oil and gas leasing and development, the 1995 RMP Amendment for OHV use, the 1995 RMP Amendment for OHV use in the GRTS, the 1998 RMP Amendment addressing coal leasing, the 1998 Amendment for cultural resources, the 2000 Final EIS for Riparian and Aquatic Habitat Management in the Farmington Field Office, and the 2000 RMP  Amendment providing standards for public land health and guidelines for livestock grazing.  Oil and Gas Leasing and Development The EIS prepared for the 1991 Oil and Gas Leasing and Development Amendment analyzed the impacts of 4,512 additional wells in the planning area to be developed by 2011, with an estimated 28,750 acres of additional surface disturbance due to oil and gas activities. All of these wells are projected to be located in the high development area shown on Map 2-1. Following is a summary of the acreage of federal minerals in the planning area subject to various constraints under this alternative: Acreage in Rest of Planning Area 110,799 31,671 1,356,971 77,392 5,368 21,380 Total Acreage 111,148 53,216 2,737,694 158,714 13,137 195,166  Constraint Leas g in Nondiscretionary Closure Discretionary Closure Deve op ment l STC CSU NSO TL  Acreage within High Development Area 349 21,545 1,380,723 81,322 7,769 173,786  Notes: STC = open under Standard Terms and Conditions; CSU = Controlled Surface Use; NSO = No Surface Occupancy; TL = Seasonal Timing Limitation.  Within the high development area, more than 99 percent of the federal oil and gas resources are currently leased. In areas identified for discretionary closure in the RMP, the development of existing leases would continue according to the terms of the lease. The BLM would continue to implement the portions of the lease that require lessees to conduct operations in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts to other resources and other land uses and users. Geologic changes over time have created various layers of sedimentary rocks and  interspersed reservoirs containing hydrocarbon resources. The resulting formations contain deposits of coal, oil, and gas. There are five primary subsurface hydrocarbon formations in the planning area: the Fruitland Formation (natural gas, coalbed methane [CBM], and coal), Pictured Cliffs (gas), Mesaverde (gas and oil), Mancos (oil and gas), and the Dakota Formation (gas, oil, and coal). More information on the geology of the planning area is provided in Chapter 3.  2-31   CHAPTER 2ALTERNATIVE A  Farmington Propo sed RMP/Final EIS  UT CO AZ NM # S 64  ( / 160  "" ! 14 0  ( / 55 0  "" ! 17 2  Teec Nos Pos  # S # S Shiprock # S Aztec  Dulce  ( /  # S Farmington # S Bloomfield  ( / 64  "" ! 112  # S Little Water # S Newcomb  "" ! 37 1  # S Nageezi  ( / 66 6  ( / 550  # Cuba S  "" ! 57  "" ! 4  "" ! 264  # S  Gallup Thoreau # S  "" ! 602  ."" ,! 40  605  # S Grants LEGEND -309608510  RMP/EIS Boundary Farmington Field Office Albuquerque Field Office Bureau of Reclamation Land National Forest Oil/Gas High Development  # S Town  . , ( / # S  Major Road Interstate Highway U.S. Route State Highway  N 15 0 Scale in Miles 15  Source: BLM 2002, Engler et al. 2001  Map 2-1: High Development Area for Oil and Gas 2-32   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE A  The location of a well drilled to a specified formation is determined by the well spacing for that formation. Spacing is regulated by the BLM and the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division (NMOCD) and is intended to maximize the economic recovery of the resource while protecting correlative rights. If spacing is not defined for a formation in a particular area, a well must be drilled according to statewide rules. The formations in the New Mexico portion of the San Juan Basin are all spaced at 160 acres, except for the Dakota, Mesaverde, and Fruitland CBM Formations, which are all spaced at 320 acres. There are provisions for infill wells within a spacing unit if it can be demonstrated that the reservoir will support an increase in well density. The Dakota and Mesaverde have both been approved by the BLM and NMOCD for infill drilling of up to three additional wells per spacing unit. The Fruitland CBM Formation is currently undergoing the same consideration for 160-acre increased density. Under this alternative, the number of wells analyzed by the EIS prepared for the RMP Amendment for oil and gas development (BLM 1991a) would support approval of approximately 223 new APDs per year over the next 9 years. Once the 17 wells that would be inaccessible due to NSO constraints are subtracted from the total, this would result in 1,990 new wells in the planning area on public land over 9 years, with an amendment to the RMP required at the end of this period. If this rate were continued over the 20-year term of this Proposed RMP/Final EIS, it would result in 4,438 potential new wells. For the purpose of comparing impacts across alternatives, impact analysis will consider the effects of developing 4,421 projected new wells (4,438 less the 17 inaccessible wells due to NSO constraints). No infill drilling with new surface disturbance would be permitted if the increased density was approved after the 1991 Amendment, except where it occurs on existing infrastructure. New oil and gas development would need to be offset with  reclaimed area to achieve no net increase in surface disturbance. The mitigation measures listed in Appendix B-9 of the 1991 Amendment (BLM 1991a) would remain in effect. These measures were developed for environmental protection in cooperation with representatives from industry and state agencies. A raptor noise policy has been in effect since February 2000 in which the FFO established a buffer zone concept to minimize noise impacts from wellhead compression. This noise policy was developed to minimize disturbances to raptor nest sites for golden eagles, ferruginous hawks, and prairie falcons by providing a reasonable margin around the nest. A buffer zone is defined as an area surrounding the nest for  mile on either side, or a circle of  mile diameter, measured from the center of the nest site. Oil and gas operators must meet a maximum noise level of 48.6 dBA (A-weighted decibels) at 300 feet from the compressor. Otherwise they must submit a Sundry Notice prior to installing a compressor to obtain an evaluation of the situation and a recommended mitigation that would not be more than 48.6 dBA. Noise associated with oil and gas development that affects other resource values and receptors are handled on a case-by-case basis. Each case is handled under a collaborative method to arrive at a solution to mitigate the impacts to the affected resource or receptor. Oil and gas development on the land around Navajo Reservoir would continue to be permitted by the FFO with review and concurrence from the USBR. In addition to the stipulations applied by the BLM, USBR stipulations on oil and gas activities include the following:  Drilling and well locations would be restricted to more than 1,500 feet from Navajo Dam and its appurtenant structures. No wells would be located within 500 feet of the high water line on Navajo Reservoir (elevation 6,101.5 feet    2-33   CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE A  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  above mean sea level [MSL]) so an NSO constraint applies. An NSO constraint would be applicable along the San Juan River.  Production facilities would not be located within 650 feet from the shoreline or on the ridgeline above the reservoir. They would be designed to minimize their visibility from the lake and other public use areas. The location of compressors would be reviewed to determine if mitigation is needed to minimize noise at recreation use areas and other sensitive locations. Co-location of gas well facilities would be encouraged to minimize surface disturbance and the duplication of facilities.    completed by USFS staff for all wells or groups of wells within the same drainage, and clearances would be required to ensure no damage to significant cultural resources, T&E species, and other resources of concern. Winter closures for drilling and workover operations from November 1 to March 31 would remain in effect on the Jicarilla Ranger District. Development on the Santa Fe National Forest would be implemented under Standard Terms and Conditions.  Land Ownership Adjustments Disposal Under this alternative, the land ownership adjustments identified in the previous RMP and amendments would be carried forward. Exchange, sale, disposal under the R&PP Act, or other legal disposal would be considered if the disposal met the criteria listed in Chapter 1. These lands include the land south and west of US 550, and approximately 2,640 acres of isolated public lands (Appendix F). Table 2-1 shows the amount of land that would be available for disposal under Alternative A. Map 2-2 shows the disposal area under this alternative.    TL constraints would be in effect within designated elk and mule deer critical winter range between December 1 and March 31, and within designated elk calving areas between December 1 and July 14. Oil and gas development on USFS land in the planning area would continue to be permitted by the FFO with concurrence by the USFS. Site-specific EAs would continue to be    Table 2-1 Land O wnershi Adjus ments ( Acres f Al rnat es A, B, C and D . p t in ) or te iv Land Adjustment Disposal Acquisition Notes: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Includes Does not Does not Does not Does not  Alternative A 280,782 127,782 1  Alternative B 347,505 77,589 1,2  Alternative C 338,067 189,679 1,2 3,5  Alternative D 340,118 178,237 1,2,4 5  BLM lands south of US 550, outside of SDAs. include acreage for parcels with substantial structures that may be identified in the future. include acreage in riparian areas that may be identified for acquisition in the future. include acreage for potential R&PP adjustments identified through scoping. include acreage of BLM lands surrounding SDAs that may be identified for acquisition in the future.  2-34   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CH APTER 2ALTERNATIVE A  UT CO AZ NM  ( / 160  "" ! 14 0  ( / 55 0  "" ! 17 2  # S Teec Nos Pos  Dulce S #  ( / 64  # S Shiprock  # S Farmington # S Bloomfield  # Aztec S  ( / 64  "" ! 112  # Little Water S # Newcomb S  "" ! 37 1  # S Nageezi  ( / 66 6  ( / 550  Rio Arriba Sandoval  San Juan McKinley  # Cuba S  "" ! 57  "" ! 4  "" ! 264  Gallup  "" ! 602  # S Thoreau  ."" ,! 40  605  Cibola Bernalillo -1763806092  # S Grants LEGEND RMP/EIS Boundary ROW Corridor (WRCS) Priority Corridors 2 and 3 Existing Disposal Area County Boundary Town  . , ( / # S  Major Road Interstate Highway U.S. Route State Highway 15  N 0 Scale in Miles 15  # S  Map 2-2: Existing Disposal Areas and WRCS Corridors (WUG Revision) 2-35  Source: BLM 2000 & WRCS 1992   CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE A  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  Acquisition Inholdings in all the approved SDAs would remain on the priority list for acquisition. Other lands that consolidate public ownership or benefit a resource program could also be acquired, if the acquisition were determined to be in the public interest. Any lands acquired would be managed in the same manner as the adjacent or surrounding public lands. Table 2-1 shows the amount of land that would be a priority for acquisition under Alternative A.  OHV Use Under Alternative A, public land in the FFO would be open to OHV use as described in the 1988 RMP, unless otherwise designated. In 1995, an RMP Amendment and EA were prepared to address management of OHV use in the FFO to protect wildlife habitat (BLM 1995b). The resulting Decision Record identified 13 OHV Management Units comprising a total of 499,040 acres shown in Map 2-3. A plan has been completed for Rosa Mesa that limits OHV use to designated maintained roads and seasonal closures on 40,960 acres of public land. Plans would be developed for 12 units that would specify limitations for the remaining 432,787 acres based on resource needs and public use. Development of plans would involve environmental review and public input. Until then, these areas would continue to be open to OHV use.  Also in 1995, BLM prepared the Proposed GRTS Off-Highway Vehicle RMP Amendment and EA. The resulting 1996 Decision Record limited OHV use to designated routes on approximately 22,800 acres and 4,600 acres under open designation within the GRTS. A 1998 RMP Amendment for 44 new cultural ACECs specified OHV management prescriptions. (Note that some plans specified prescriptions for Off-Road Vehicles, or ""ORVs."" For consistency in terminology, the FFO is using OHV in future plans or revisions to refer to any motorized or mechanized vehicle. This term will supercede and incorporate any previously approved and continuing guidance for vehicles). Table 2-2 summarizes open, closed, and limited designation for all public land within the FFO for this alternative. All existing and proposed SMAs and ACECs have specific OHV designations (see section on Specially Designated Areas below). Table 2-3 lists several activities that may involve crosscountry travel and issues related to cross-county travel. For Alternative A, access and crosscountry travel would be allowed unless specifically prohibited. OHV designations and management would only apply to BLM surfaceowned lands. For lands acquired in the future, the OHV management prescription would generally be the same as the surrounding unit or the SDA.

Table 2-4 summarizes the total acreage in these areas under each alternative, and Table 2-5 summarizes the management prescriptions and actions for each SDA. The acreage in the table is derived from current BLM GIS data, which is different, in some cases, from that shown in previous planning documents. Previous documents were not always consistent in how the acreage was  calculated or listed for each area. In some cases, only the acreage of public land within SDAs was listed, while in others the acreage of all land within the boundary was shown. Adjustments have been made in some of the digitized boundaries to correct previous errors and to account for updated information. As activity plans are prepared for these areas in the future, more accurate and detailed maps will be developed. Those new plans will note changes and corrections to GIS mapping. Legal boundaries for cultural ACECs are maintained on Master Title Plats in the field offices (FFO and AFO). These are the official records.

Table 2-6 lists the SDAs in the AFO and the oil and gas management prescriptions that would apply under all alternatives. Map 2-4 (large fold-out map for Alternative A, located at end of document, inside back cover) shows the boundaries of designated areas. The following changes in special designations have been approved and implemented since the 1988 RMP were adopted:  In 1996, Congress designated the Bisti/De-na-zin WA to create one wilderness unit comprised of the Bisti and De-na-zin WAs and 16,525 additional contiguous acres. The new unit included the Badlands, Log Jam,  and Lost Pines ACECs, which were originally within WA boundaries;  In 1998, an amendment was completed to designate 44 new cultural ACECs, including Chacoan outliers, Chacoan roads, Navajo Refugee sites, Navajo habitation sites, petroglyph and pictograph sites, historic sites, and Native American traditional use sites and sacred area; The original 150-acre GRTS was expanded to include 32,423 acres that are managed for recreational opportunities for trail and OHV use.    2-39   TO VIEW TABLE 2-5 (PAGES 2-40 THROUGH 2-213), OPEN FILE ENTITLED ""TABLE 2-5.PDF""   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE A  Table 2-6 Oi and Gas Manage ment Prescr p ions for Spec a ly Des gnated Areas in the AF O .l it il i Area 1870s Wagon Road Trail SMA Historic Homesteads SMA Jones Canyon SMA Cuba Airport SMA San Luis Cliffs Window SMA Torrejon Fossil Fauna ACEC Azabache Station SMA Cabezon Peak ACEC Caon Jarido SMA Continental Divide Trail SMA Headcut Prehistoric Community SMA Ignacio Chavez SMA Total Acres1 630 2  Public Land Acres1 UNK 33 415 92 8,283 6,497 0 1,187 1,800 UNK 933 42,650  Federal Mineral Acres1 UNK 33 651 176 9,806 6,084 81 1,197 1,800 UNK 2,276 42,768  Resource Value Cultural Cultural Cultural Lands Lands Paleontology Recreation Recreation Recreation Recreation Recreation Recreation  Management Prescriptions Oil and gas: CSU restrictions.

The leasing of these tracts was analyzed in the San Juan River Regional Coal EIS (BLM 1984). These tracts were identified for future leasing in the Farmington RMP (BLM 1988). The PRLAs are located north and east of Chaco Culture National Historic Park. Several PRLAs fall within cultural ACECs, WSAs, RNAs, and WAs. According to regulatory requirements (43 CFR 3461.5), unsuitability criteria (Appendix C) have been applied to the 14 PRLAs. PRLAs NM-003835 (in part) and NM-006802 (in part) have been identified as being unsuitable for leasing under Criterion No. 1. PRLAs NM-003918 (in part) and NM-003919 (in part) were identified as being unsuitable for leasing under Criterion No. 4. Parts of three PRLAs, NM-003753, NM-003754, and NM-003835, were determined to be unsuitable under Criterion No. 6. One PRLA, NM-003755 (in part), was determined to be unsuitable under Criterion No. 7. There are two PRLAs (NM-006802 and NM-003835 both in part) in the Bisti/De-nazin WA and two PRLAs (NM-003919 and NM-003918 both in part) in the Ah-shi-slepah WSA. Parts of three PRLAs (NM-003753, NM-003835, and NM-003754) fall within the Fossil Forest RNA, and one PRLA (NM-  003755 in part) is within the Ah-shi-sle-pah Road cultural ACEC. Congressional designation of the Bisti/De-na-zin WA and Fossil Forest RNA prevents the leasing of coal in these areas and, until Congress reaches a decision, no coal leases would be granted in Ah-shi-sle-pah WSA. Under Public Law 104333, Section 1022, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to issue coal leases in New Mexico in exchange for those parcels of PRLAs that are in a WA or RNA, if the exchange is in the public interest. Leasing may occur in the Ah-shi-sle-pah WSA, if Congress does not designate the area as Wilderness. The remaining seven PRLAs would be processed and the applications approved or denied according to the criteria established by the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA) of 1920, as amended. These leasing criteria are concerned with leasing coal in (1) commercial quantities, (2) in areas with a coal transportation system, and (3) when there is a viable market for the coal. If the MLA criteria are met, leases would be issued to the companies that submitted these applications. At the time lease applications are processed, the unsuitability criteria would be applied again, if necessary. The PRLA serial numbers, total acreage, surface acreage ownership and acreage affected by unsuitability criteria are presented in Table 2-7. The location and boundaries of the 14 PRLAs are shown on Map 2-8.  2-214   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE A  Table 2-7 Pre erence Right Lease Appl a ions in the P anning Area .f ic t l PRLA Serial No. NM-008128 NM-008130 NM-011670 NM-003752 NM-003753 NM-003754 NM-003755 NM-003918 NM-003919 NM-003835 NM-003837 NM-007235 NM-008745 NM-006802 Total Acreage Source:  Federal Coal BLM Surface Indian Surface Acreage Acreage Acreage 4,499 2,133 1,119 3,760 2,951 2,875 2,588 3,357 3,598 375 560 160 520 213 28,708 1,007 608 639 2,876 825 1,875 973 2,998 3,598 650 560 160 320 213 17,302 2,811 1,525 0 844 2,126 1,000 1,615 359 0 0 0 0 200 0 10,480  State Surface Acreage 681 0 480 0 0 0 0 0 0 85 0 0 0 0 1,246  Criterion Removed Acreage 0 0 0 980 825 280 669 884 3,124 325 0 0 0 170 7,257  Digitized from BLM maps.  Competitive Coal Tracts There are 17 competitive coal tracts available for leasing. The leasing of these tracts was analyzed in the San Juan River Regional Coal EIS (BLM 1984). These tracts were identified for future leasing in the Farmington RMP (BLM 1988). The La Plata tracts are located southwest of the La Plata Coal Mine. The Kimbeto and Bisti tracts are located northeast and northwest, respectively, of the Chaco Culture National Historic Park. The Catalpa Canyon and Sundance tracts are located south of Gallup, which is outside the planning area but still under the management of the FFO through Inter-Area Agreement NM-010-071, dated July 2, 1992. The Catalpa and Sundance tracts will not be addressed further in this Proposed RMP/Final EIS. The remaining tracts are located south of the Chaco Culture National Historic Park. The tract name, federal surface  acres, federal recoverable coal reserves, and federal mineable coal reserves are listed in Table 2-8. The boundaries and location of the competitive coal lease tracts are shown on Map 2-8. These tracts contain approximately 763 million tons of mineable federal coal (647 recoverable) within 48,661 federal subsurface acres (17,927 surface) (BLM 1984). The delineation and designation of these coal tracts were based on the application of the unsuitability criteria, surface owner consultation data, and application of a series of multiple use screens (43 CFR 3461). Companies interested in mining the coal from these tracts would need to submit an application to lease the coal. The 20 unsuitability criteria (Appendix C) described in 43 CFR 3461.5 would be applied during the leasing process.  2-215   CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE A  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  Table 2-8 Co mpet t e Coa Lease Trac s . i iv l t Tract Name Bisti #1 Bisti #4 Bisti #6/8 Sundance Catalpa Canyon Chico Wash South Crownpoint East Divide Gallo Wash #1 Kimbeto #2 La Plata #1 La Plata #3 Lee Ranch East Lee Ranch Middle Lee Ranch West Star Lake East #1 Star Lake West #2 Total Source: Digitized from BLM maps.

The Coal Belt SMA contains an estimated four billion tons of coal (BLM 1988). The SMA is located along the Fruitland coal (outcrop) belt from the Navajo Reservation near Bisti Trading Post to a point near Johnson Trading Post in western Sandoval County. The southern line represents the outcrop of the lowest coal seam; the northern boundary of the SMA is located where the overburden on the uppermost coal seam is 350 feet thick. The depth of the coal seam to the amount of overburden would result in extraction of most of the coal in the SMA using  surface mining methods. The FFO would retain the public (surface) land in the SMA because of the large coal deposits and the possibility of conflicts between other future surface owner regarding coal leasing and/or mining. Companies interested in obtaining a coal lease in the SMA would need to submit an application to the FFO. The 20 unsuitability criteria would be applied during the leasing process. Portions of the Coal Belt SMA are within the southern and western boundaries of the Bisti/De-na-zin WA and entirely within the Fossil Forest RNA and Ah-shi-sle-pah Road cultural ACEC. Another portion of the SMA falls within the Ah-shi-sle-pah WSA. Congressional designation of the Bisti/De-nazin WA and Fossil Forest RNA prevents the leasing of coal in these areas. Until Congress  2-216   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE A  reaches a decision on the status of the Ah-shisle-pah WSA, no coal leases will be granted in that area. Leasing may occur in the Ah-shi-slepah WSA, if Congress does not designate the area as Wilderness. The SMA boundary is mapped by legal subdivisions and shown on Map 2-4. License to Mine [Home Use Fuel (Coal) Source] The existing domestic coal licenses on public lands would continue to be managed by the BLM. Navajo allottees in the area have historically used coal from surface outcrops as fuel for cooking and heating. There is one domestic use mining license issued to the Torrejon Chapter. The licenses allow members of a Chapter to collect federal coal for personal use. New domestic coal license applications would be considered on a case-by-case basis.  those instances where fire suppression or fuel management activities could be damaging to long-term ecosystem function.  Locate incident bases, camps, helibases, staging areas, helispots, and other centers for incident activities outside of special administrative designation areas. If the only suitable location for such activities is within the special administrative designation areas, an exemption may be granted following a review and recommendation by a resource advisor. The advisor will prescribe the location, use conditions, and rehabilitation requirements. Minimize delivery of chemical retardant, foam, or other additives to surface waters. An exception may be warranted in situations where overriding immediate safety imperatives exist or, following a review and recommendation by a resource advisor, when an uncontrolled fire would cause more long-term damage. Immediately establish an emergency team to develop a rehabilitation treatment plan needed to attain special administrative designation areas objectives, whenever a wildfire or a prescribed fire burning outside prescribed parameters significantly damages them. Allow some natural fires to burn under prescribed conditions. This decision will be based on additional analysis and planning.    Fire/Fuels Management The FFO has developed a Fire Management Plan to provide managers in the Fire Program with a functional document for integrating fire management with all other resource management programs. The plan establishes fire/fuels management and fire response/suppression direction based on safety, resource management objectives, and land use allocation objectives. Within SDAs (SMAs, ACECs, WAs, WSAs, RNAs, etc.), management actions adhere to the following guidance:  Address Fire/Fuels Management for all land use allocations as part of watershed analysis and/or project planning. This will include determinations of the role of fire and the risk of large-scale, high-intensity wildfires at the landscape level. Use prescribed fire or other fuel management treatments to reduce fuel hazards and the risk of large-scale, highintensity fire, consistent with the natural role of fire and protection standards for each special administrative designation area. Strategies will recognize the role of fire in ecosystem function and identify        Locate and manage water-drafting sites (e.g., sites where water is pumped to control or suppress fires) to minimize adverse effects on riparian habitat and water quality. Under Alternative A, this guidance would apply to the SDAs in the FFO. In other FFO areas, the emphasis in most cases consists of aggressive initial attack to extinguish fires at the smallest size possible.    2-217   CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE A  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  For wildland fires that escape initial attack, a Wildland Situation Analysis is performed to develop a suppression strategy to evaluate the damage induced by suppression activities compared to expected wildfire damage. Suppression tactics consider:    Public and firefighting personnel safety; Protection of specific attributes of each land use allocation; Coordination of wildfire suppression activities to avoid causing adverse impacts on federal and non-federal lands; Appropriate use such as aircraft, other mechanized definitions of any their use; of suppression tools dozers, pumps, and equipment, and clear restrictions relating to      Consistency with objectives for land use allocations; Maintenance or restoration of ecosystem processes or structure;    The potential adverse effects on meeting ecosystem management objectives. Fuels management activities are employed to modify fuel profiles in order to lower the potential of fire ignition and rate of spread; protect and support land use allocation objectives by lowering the risk of highintensity, stand-replacing wildfires; and adhere to smoke management and air quality standards. Fire hazards are reduced through methods such as prescribed burning, mechanical or manual manipulation of vegetation and debris, removal of woodland vegetation and debris, and combinations of these methods. Hazard reduction plans will be developed through an interdisciplinary team approach and will consider the following:     Safety of firefighting personnel; Developing a fuel profile that supports land allocation objectives; Reducing the risk of wildfire in a costefficient manner; Interagency cooperation to assure costeffective fuel hazard reduction across the landscape; Adherence to smoke management and air quality standards;      The natural role of fire in specific landscapes, current ecosystem needs, and wildfire hazard analysis included in the fire management plan. Management of woodland fuels is important for preventing and controlling wildfire. In managing woodlands, this involves the manipulation of the fuels (vegetative materials) either by mechanical or manual methods, or through prescribed fire. Fuels treatment is an especially important consideration in the rural/urban interface areas, where forest fuels are in close proximity to private dwellings, businesses, and other structures. Mechanical and manual methods would be used in these areas and in areas where air quality considerations require reduced smoke emissions. Partial entry of prescribed fire may be initiated into natural stands where severe natural fuels buildup would contribute to high-intensity standdestroying fires. The use of prescribed fire will be based on the risk of high-intensity wildfire, and the associated cost and environmental impacts of using prescribed burning to meet protection, restoration, and maintenance of critical stands that are currently susceptible to large-scale catastrophic wildfire. Under-burning will be reintroduced in areas over a period of time to create a mosaic of stand conditions. Treatments should be sitespecific because some species with limited distributions are fire intolerant. The use of prescribed burning will be based on an interdisciplinary evaluation. Funding authority, therefore, must reflect the range of objectives identified for using fire under ecosystem management. Project level prescribed fire plans will be developed using an interdisciplinary team approach. Plans will address: (1) adherence to smoke management and air quality standards,  2-218   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE A  (2) meeting stated objectives for the land use allocations, (3) maintaining or restoring ecosystem processes or structure, and (4) the role of natural fire in specific landscapes, current ecosystem needs, and wildfire hazard analysis included in the fire management plan. Prescribed fire is used to emulate the natural role of fire to achieve resource objectives for wildlife enhancement, plant species maintenance, woodland biodiversity, and site preparation. Prescribed under-burning some proportion of homogeneous plant communities would be dependent on the type and amount of complexity that would be needed for any one plant community. The types of plant communities that may be targeted for burning would include contiguous monotypic sagebrush or woodland stands to promote more diversity or heterogeneity. Fire would be the preferred method of disturbance for biological reasons, but other methods of disturbance may produce similar results, such as chemical treatment or manipulation by machine. In order to ensure that resource objectives such as wildlife and botanical species maintenance are met and that biodiversity elements are perpetuated, it may be necessary to employ applications of natural cycle related cool fires. There are approximately 175,000 acres of the FFO land base that could lend  themselves to fire entry under prescription. It is reasonable to assume that at least an annual average of 500 acres of prescribed burning may be implemented to meet resource objectives. This would assume an approximate 30 to 50year rotation cycle on some sites throughout the 175,000-acre land base. It is neither possible nor desirable to burn every acre on a 30 to 50-year cycle. Some sites would not benefit positively from the entry of either prescribed fire or wildfire; however, many would. Resource specialists must develop specific resource objectives and develop extensive plans to determine specific sites where benefits can occur. The need for prescribed fire varies for each resource. For example, botanical enhancement fires may need to be introduced on an annual basis on some sites. On other sites, such as under old growth stands (Douglas fir), the rotational burning could be up to 60-plus years depending on the particular site, soil structure, or other mixed plant communities. As specific area studies are developed, the need for fire applications upon a particular site will be clearly defined and activity plans developed accordingly. Air quality considerations are also a factor in prescribed burns, in accordance with regulation and the New Mexico Smoke Management Plan.  2-219   CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE B  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  Alternative B Under Alternative B, the Farmington RMP would be amended to allow for maximum oil and gas development in the planning area and maximization of other public use of FFO land. Access and land use limitations would be minimized, consistent with the continuing management guidance. In the event of land use conflicts, priority would be given to minerals recovery.  Oil and Gas Leasing and Development This alternative would provide for the development of 13,275 wells in the planning area, after the 17 wells that would be Constraint Leasing Nondiscretionary Closure Discretionary Closure Development STC CSU NSO TL Note:  inaccessible due to NSO constraints are subtracted from the total. For analysis purposes only, no commingling of wells is assumed to occur under this alternative in order to evaluate maximum potential surface disturbance. Approximately 660 APDs per year would be approved over the next 20 years (Engler et al. 2001). The STCs on oil and gas leases would be the same as those in Alternative A. The mitigation measures listed in Appendix B-9 of the 1991 Amendment (BLM 1991a) would remain in effect. Following is a summary of the acreage of federal minerals in the planning area subject to various constraints under this alternative:  Acreage within High Development Area 349 6,001 1,324,428 150,083 10,847 175,852  Acreage in Rest of Planning Area 110,799 22,272 1,335,557 86,187 2,443 64,207  Total Acreage 111,148 28,273 2,659,985 236,270 13,290 240,059  STC = open under Standard Terms and Conditions; CSU = Controlled Surface Use; NSO = No Surface Occupancy; TL = Seasonal Timing Limitation.  Within the high development area, more than 99 percent of the federal oil and gas resources are currently leased. In areas being considered for discretionary closure in the RMP, the development of existing leases would continue according to the terms of the lease. The BLM would continue to implement the portions of the lease that require lessees to conduct operations in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts to other resources and other land uses and users. Assumptions related to oil and gas development that were prepared by FFO staff with concurrence from industry include the following:    New surface disturbance would occur on 54 percent of all new wells, while 46 percent would be on existing sites through re-completion, dual completion, or directional drilling. The surface disturbance associated with each new well pad would average 2 acres, after interim reclamation or site rehabilitation takes place. The road and pipeline disturbance associated with each new well would average 1 additional acre. The road and pipeline will be constructed within the same 800-foot by 50-foot ROW.      2-220   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE B  Reclamation would be completed at an initial rate of 133 well pads and associated ROWs per year and average 3 acres per well. The plugging and abandonment (P&A) rate is projected to increase at the rate of 5 percent per year over 20 years. Most P&As would occur in the fringe areas of the project, with abandoned sites in the high development area likely to be used again. As described under Alternative A, the raptor noise policy, in effect since February 2000, in which the FFO established a buffer zone to minimize noise impacts from wellhead compression on raptor nest sites for golden eagles, ferruginous hawks, and prairie falcons by providing a reasonable margin around the nest would be implemented. Oil and gas development on the land around Navajo Reservoir would be managed under CSU constraints approved by the FFO in cooperation with the USBR. There would be no change from Alternative A on the Carson and Santa Fe National Forests.    Officer determines that such disposal is in the public interest. Table 2-1 shows the total acres available for disposal under this alternative. Acquisition Inholdings in all of the approved SDAs would make up the priority list for acquisitions. Other lands that consolidate public ownership or benefit a resource program could also be acquired, if the acquisition were determined to be in the public interest. Any lands acquired would be managed in the same manner as the adjacent or surrounding public lands. Table 2-1 shows total acquisition under this alternative. ROW Corridors Under this alternative, the ROW corridors identified by the 2002 WUG revision (WUG 2002) of the 1992 WRCS would be designated for powerline and pipeline use. Any specific proposals would still be required to go through the environmental and permitting process. Proposed uses that are determined to unreasonably interfere with the use of these corridors may not be authorized. Map 2-2 shows the general alignment of the corridors. Mineral Materials The FFO has identified six areas (16,520 acres) of salable minerals such as sand and gravel that needs to be well managed. Additional areas could be identified in the future. Some of these areas are within the disposal area identified above. The purpose of delineating these areas is to inform managers and potential users of other resources in these areas of their value for salable minerals, so that value would be considered prior to the authorization of other actions.  Land Ownership Adjustments Disposal Under this alternative, all of the lands identified for disposal in Alternative A would be available. In addition, lands within three miles of the city limits of Aztec, Bloomfield and Farmington (Map 2-5) would be available (except BLM land within SDAs). Exchange, sale, disposal under the R&PP Act, or other legal disposal would be considered if the disposal met the criteria listed in Chapter 1. Parcels on which substantial improvements have be inadvertently placed would also be made available for disposal, if the Authorized  2-221   CHAPTER 2ALTERNATIVE A  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  Q R 170 Aztec    64 371  Farmington  Crouch Mesa  Q R  Bloomfield    550  LEGEND RMP/EIS Boundary Area of Potential Land Disposal Municipal Boundary BLM Owned Land Alt D Aztec-Bloomfield Corridor  1143800835       (  ( !

The 13 areas were derived by access routes, entry points, and use patterns for more effective management. Map 2-6 shows the redefined units. Seven trails have been identified in four OHV Management Units (Table 2-9). The general location of these trails is shown in Map 2-7. Final alignment and use of the proposed trails would be determined when individual OHV Activity Plans are developed. Additional routes, trails, and areas may be identified, as plans are developed for each OHV Management Unit. Plans would be written based on priority of resource protection needs and the amount of public use. Plan development would be based on environmental review and public involvement. The individual OHV Activity Plans should be completed within 15 years. OHV designations for SDAs may be different than the surrounding OHV Management Unit. Table 2-2 summarizes the acreage of open, limited and closed OHV designation for Alternative B. In addition to the preparation of OHV Activity Plans, the FFO will prepare a Transportation Plan. The Transportation Plan will identify collector and resource roads that would be needed for use over the long-term. These roads would remain open for public access when oil and gas development in the area ceases. Roads identified in the Transportation Plan would be included in the individual OHV Activity Plans.

Table 2-10 summarizes the acreage that the FFO considers potentially suitable for cross-country travel in each of the proposed OHV Management Units. To be suitable, the land had to be:   BLM surface; Outside an SDA;   Outside a designated disposal area. Land meeting the above criteria were identified as dispersed recreation areas, to which additional criteria were applied to determine the amount of each OHV Management Unit that would not likely be damaged by cross-country travel. In order to exclude the land that would be most susceptible to wind and water erosion, damage to vegetation or soil biological crusts, and prime farmland, land meeting the following criteria were excluded:     Slopes greater than 30 percent; South-facing slopes steeper than 15 percent; Seasonal high water table; Depth to bedrock less than 20 inches;   Highly erodible by wind or water. The dispersed recreation areas that could be designated as open to cross-country travel would be further refined as OHV Management Unit plans are developed by FFO staff. Other site-specific screening criteria that could further restrict the potentially open areas would be applied during plan development, including avoidance of cultural resources, sensitive species habitats, riparian areas, and proximity to residences.  2-223   CHAPTER 2ALTERNATIVE B  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS Middle Farmington NavajoMesa Reservoir Aztec  Shiprock  !

Note: (1) Dispersed area is comprised of BLM surface lands that are not within an SDA (where management prescriptions for OHV use for the managed area would apply).  Specially Designated Areas Under Alternative B, 545,999 acres in the FFO would have special management, of which BLM currently manages the surface on 468,410 acres. Areas with special administrative designations (SMAs, ACECs, RNAs, WAs, and WSAs) approved through previous land use planning would be carried forward with changes described below. Accounting for these changes, there would be 135 SDAs in the FFO under Alternative B. Changes in management prescriptions for new and existing areas are described in Table 2-5. Map 2-8 (large foldout map for Alternative B, located at end of document, inside back cover) shows adjusted boundaries under this alternative. Please refer to Table 2-5 for name changes.  Areas Not Carried Forward  The Coal Belt SMA would be removed because all areas that are suitable for coal would be available for consideration for coal extraction under the lease by application procedures. The Right-of-Way Windows (4 units) would be removed. Farmington Lake Watershed would be removed because most of the property within the SMA is not owned by BLM, and a small portion is within the GRTS SMA. Lost Pine, Log Jam, and Badlands ACEC designations would be removed because they are within the Bisti/De-nazin WA and consequently protected for wilderness values.       2-226   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE B    Aztec Gilia ACEC designation would be removed, as the range and distribution of Aztec gilia is more extensive than previously identified. Tanner Lake Battlefield was dropped because surface ownership was transferred to The Navajo Nation as part of the Navajo-Hopi land exchange.  area would be used by OHVs on designated trails.  Navajo Lake Horse Trail Recreation Area would be designated for recreational values, promoting equestrian use. Designated trail corridors would define the area. Alien Run Mountain Bike Trail Recreation Area would be designated for recreational values, and nonmotorized use on the trail corridors. The boundary of Thomas Canyon Recreation Area would be enlarged and a wildlife management component would be added to the larger SMA, in addition to current recreational emphasis. Carracas Mesa Recreation Area would add a wildlife management component in addition to the current recreational emphasis.      Areas Added or Changed Wildlife and Threatened and Endangered Species  Laguna Seca Mesa SMA would be enlarged and designated as the Mexican Spotted Owl ACEC and the management emphasis would change from forestry to T&E habitat values in order to delineate the critical habitat designated by the USFWS. The Ephemeral Wash Riparian Area would be added to provide protection of riparian resources. Management would be applied to promote the attainment and maintenance of proper functioning conditions and provide habitats for wildlife.       Paleontology  The Pion Mesa Fossil Area would be added to protect significant paleontological values. Gobernador and Cereza Canyon Fossil Areas would be added to protect significant paleontological values. The Lybrook Fossil Area would be added to protect significant paleontological values. The Bohanon Canyon Complex would be added to protect significant paleontological values. The Carson Fossil Pocket would be added to protect significant paleontological values. The Kutz Canyon Paleontological Area would be expanded to protect significant paleontological values.  Recreation  Simon Canyon ACEC would be expanded to include the portion of the Simon Canyon Recreation Area that extends beyond the ACEC boundary. The SMA designation would be removed and the area would be managed as an ACEC. GRTS will change names to Glade Run Recreation Area. In addition, its boundary would be changed to better reflect the area of current use. This would result in a reduction in acreage. Pion Mesa Recreation Area would be designated for recreational values. There would be several trails with different types of use. Rock Garden Recreation Area would be designated for recreational values. The                Coal Leasing Suitability Assessment Under this alternative, emphasis of the other resource uses in the PRLAs and competitive coal tracts would shift so coal    2-227   CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE B  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  development would become the primary resource use and the emphasis of other, existing resource uses would change. Should any of the existing oil and gas leases expire in these areas, the leases would not be reissued until coal mining is completed. There would be no future leasing of oil and gas resources until all mining is completed or specific areas are released for leasing. Current oil and gas operations and facilities may include, but are not limited to (1) P&A, producing, and abandoned wells, (2) redrilling of these wells after mining has progressed past the well location, (3) purchasing the product estimated to be produced for the remainder of the life of the well, (4) compensating the operator/lessee for any surface damage to facilities, or (5) replacement of surface and pipeline facilities after mining is completed. Future well development on existing oil and gas leases would be coordinated with the BLM staff and the mining company to avoid proposed and active coal mining areas. Preference Right Leasing Application Under this alternative, the 14 PRLAs identified and described in Alternative A would be carried forward for further consideration for coal leasing. Those PRLAs that fall within the cultural ACECs, WA, and RNA would not be approved for coal mining. No coal leases or PRLAs would be granted in the Ah-shi-sle-pah WSA until Congress reaches a decision on its wilderness designation. This would include approximately 4,008 (844 acres in PRLA NM-003918 and 3,124 acres in PRLA NM-003919) acres that would not be available for coal leasing. Leasing may occur, if Congress does not designate the area as wilderness. Those portions of PRLAs affected by Congressional designations may be exchanged for coal leases in New Mexico if the exchange is in the public interest. The PRLAs that are not rejected through adjudication would be issued to companies that submitted applications, if they meet the MLA criteria. The 20 unsuitability criteria (Appendix C) described in 43 CFR 3461.5 would be reapplied during the leasing process.  Competitive Coal Tracts The 17 competitive coal tracts discussed as available for leasing in Alternative A would be considered for leasing under this alternative. Those companies that are interested in mining coal from these tracts would need to submit an application to lease the coal. The 20 unsuitability criteria (Appendix C) described in 43 CFR 3461.5 would be reapplied during the leasing process. License to Mine [Home Use Fuel (Coal) Source] The need for domestic home fuel needs would continue as described in Alternative A. New domestic coal license applications would be considered on a case-by-case basis. Additional Coal Interests Two coal mining companies, Peabody Natural Resources, Inc. (Peabody) and Broken Hills Proprietary Company, Limited (BHP), have expressed interest that additional tracts of land be considered for future coal leasing. These lands are in the vicinity of the Lee Ranch, Twin Peaks, and East Pion areas. Map 2-8 shows the location of these tracts. Peabody owns reserves consisting primarily of state and fee land, which frequently occur in blocks in a checkerboard pattern that do not extend over a logical mining unit. Some of these areas have adjacent federal coal reserves that could be logically developed in conjunction with Peabody's existing holdings. Peabody's additional coal tracts interests would augment the three Lee Ranch competitive coal tracts. There is a potential for coal and coal fired power generation to increase in the southwestern U.S. Therefore, adjacent federal coal reserve areas may provide the potential for new mine development or to extend the life of the existing Lee Ranch Coal Mine. BHP's San Juan Coal Company (SJCC) currently operates coal surfacing mining operations within the boundaries of the FFO. Presently, SJCC is developing an underground mine (Deep Lease and Deep Lease Extension) adjacent to its present surface mining  2-228   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE B  operations. The Twin Peaks area contains a coal tract that has the potential to extend SJCC's planned underground mine adjacent to the San Juan Coal Mine, located adjacent to and east of the SJCC's Deep Lease Extension. SJCC has examined the potential that this tract could be mined following completion of mining underground coal within its Deep Lease (Lease No. NM-28093) and the Deep Lease Extension (Lease NM-99144) leases. Information obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for existing gas wells and extrapolation of drilling and trends conducted from the Twin Peaks and East Pion areas were used to estimate tonnage projections. This potential consists of federal coal with the exception of one state section (Section 16, T30N, R14W). The surface of this area is also federally owned except for approximately 120 acres of fee surface (private) in Section 33, 50 acres in Section 8, all in T30N, R14W, and the state section described above. To protect recreation values no underground mining would be permitted along the trail corridor in the part of the Twin Peaks area that overlies the Pion Mesa Trail Corridor. The remainder of the Twin Peaks area would be available for leasing. To protect paleontology values, paleontological surveys would be conducted for fossil remains prior to underground mining. During active underground mining, periodic monitoring may be required for paleontological resources that may be exposed as a result of subsidence. The East Pion area tract represents a possible coal resource for SJCC to mine by underground methods following completion of mining underground coal within its Deep Lease and the Deep Lease Extension. This area lies adjacent and north of the Deep Lease and Deep Lease Extension areas. No drilling to determine coal tonnage, quality, and trend has been undertaken for this tract. Drilling data of existing SJCC coal leases, USGS data, and gas well information in the area have been used to extrapolate tonnage projections. Coal quality is expected to be comparable to the coal seams  being currently mined to the west and the Deep Lease tract to the south. All coal in this is area is federally owned. However, approximately onethird of the surface is federally owned and twothirds is privately owned fee surface. Suitable Future Leasing and Development Coal Areas All lands within the FFO boundaries have been identified as potentially being suitable for future coal mining development. The 20 unsuitability criteria that eliminate such land as wilderness areas, designated T&E species habitat, ROWs/easements, and culturally significant areas (Appendix C) have been applied throughout the planning area to the extent possible at a small scale and with currently available data. If changing conditions warrant, the unsuitability criteria would be reapplied. Any proposed areas would be processed through a Lease by Application after undergoing further site-specific application of the unsuitability screening criteria. It was determined that 378,875 acres would be suitable to consider for future leasing and development in the FFO area. The general location of these areas remaining after application of most of the unsuitability criteria is shown on Map 2-9. The remainder of the FFO boundary can be considered if there are (1) commercial quantities, (2) areas with a coal transportation system, and (3) when there is a viable market for the coal. Additional data will be required to make determinations on the location of commercial quantities of coal throughout the FFO area. These data would be obtained as companies do developmental exploration to identify potential coal tracts for mining.  Fire/Fuels Management Fire/fuels management procedures under Alternative B will be the same as Alternative A, except in the number of acres in SDAs. Under this alternative, 468,410 acres of public land would fall under the guidance for these areas. Other areas would be managed in accordance with the procedures described for Alternative A.  2-229   CHAPTER 2ALTERNATIVE B ! ! ! Shiprock Aztec  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS T31N T30N  !

Additional areas would be delineated for special management designation.  Oil and Gas Leasing and Development This alternative would result in the development of approximately 9,836 wells, after the 134 wells that would be inaccessible due to NSO constraints are subtracted from the total. In addition to the STCs imposed under Alternative A, more limiting stipulations and other agency management restrictions would be Constraint Leasing Nondiscretionary Closure Discretionary Closure Development STC CSU NSO TL  imposed. Commingling would be required to minimize surface disturbance. The FFO would permit 80-acre spacings for the Mesaverde and the Dakota Formations, but only on the same well pad. The Fruitland Formation would be approved on 160-acre spacings, but only where the wells fall on or adjacent to existing infrastructure. The BLM would work with NMOCD to allow operators to access the Dakota Formation from Mesaverde sites at the discretion of the operator. The number of APDs to be approved would remain at approximately 500 per year over the next 20 years. Following is a summary of the acreage of federal minerals in the planning area subject to various constraints under this alternative:  Acreage within High Development Area 349 74,897 1,180,511 200,002 35,949 573,980  Acreage in Rest of Planning Area 110,799 39,203 1,398,772 75,190 19,121 64,421  Total Acreage 111,148 114,100 2,579,283 275,192 55,070 638,401  Notes: STC = Open under Standard Terms and Conditions; CSU = Controlled Surface Use; NSO = No Surface Occupancy; TL = Seasonal Timing Limitation.  Within the high development area, more than 99 percent of the federal oil and gas resources are currently leased. In areas being considered for discretionary closure in the RMP, the development of existing leases would continue according to the terms of the lease. The BLM would continue to implement the portions of the lease that require lessees to conduct operations in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts to other resources and other land uses and users. Noise from oil and gas compressors has been identified by the public as an issue of primary concern in the planning area. To address these concerns, the FFO developed a Noise Policy, which would be implemented in  the form of an NTL to oil and gas operators or ROW stipulation that would require mitigation of noise levels measured within and adjacent to designated Noise Sensitive Areas (NSA). The NSAs include 92 SDAs managed by the FFO, as well as all or part of seven areas within the USFS Jicarilla Ranger District, all of the USBR land, and one NPS area. The public land surface of these areas totals approximately 338,680 acres. Noise levels inside an NSA would be limited to no more than 48.6 dBA equivalent sound level (Leq) at 300 feet in all directions from the noise source. For noise sources located outside of designated NSAs, the standard of 48.6 dBA Leq would be met at the boundary of the NSA.  2-231   CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE C  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  Noise sources located within 300 feet of the NSA boundary would be allowed to meet the standard 300 feet from the source. For noise sources involving federal or Indian leases located near occupied dwellings or buildings, the standard of 48.6 dBA Leq would be met 100 feet from such structure. Additional information on the Noise Policy is included in Appendix E. In addition to implementation of the Noise Policy, the raptor noise policy to minimize noise impacts from wellhead compression on raptor nest sites would be implemented as described under Alternative A. The mitigation measures listed in Appendix B-9 of the 1991 RMP Amendment (BLM 1991a) would be replaced with more generalized narrative that accomplishes the same overall goal of minimizing erosion and wildlife habitat disturbance. The following mitigation measures would be implemented where applicable, depending on site-specific conditions and requirements:  Make every effort to minimize surface disturbance and intrusion into undisturbed areas through such actions as twinning of wells and directional drilling, unorthodox locations, recompletions, commingling of gas, and closed loop mud systems. Pipelines would follow existing roads. Development would be restricted in areas that have special topography (steep or broken and/or on benches) and soil concerns. Development in these areas would be considered on a case-by-case basis and would contain site-specific mitigation stipulations. Operators would be encouraged to unitize in areas of heavy development to increase management efficiency and facilitate operations in sensitive areas. Off-site mitigation may be indicated in crucial areas, such as areas with wildlife monitoring or studies, habitat replacement, water development, and watershed protection measures.  Vehicle traffic and resource damage would be reduced by using new technology such as electronic data interchange and piping of produced water. Listed below is a summary of the types of activities that would not be permissible during a closure period in an area under TL constraints. Emergency repairs needed for human safety and environmental contamination would not require prior authorization. Emergency repairs include a break in a gas or water line, repairs of tank battery facilities, and wellhead repairs.  Any construction, including new well pads, roads, pipelines, installation of compressors, surfacing of roads, powerlines. Well pad, road construction and road improvement. Drilling. P&A (unless required environmental damage). Seismic exploration. to prevent               Workovers or any activity requiring a drilling rig, unless required to prevent environmental damage, or to prevent a permanent loss of reserves. Prior approval must be approved before beginning this type of work. Activities that are routine and do not conflict with the seasonal restrictions include routine daily operations, road maintenance, and routine pipeline maintenance. Oil and gas development on the land around Navajo Reservoir would be managed under NSO constraints. All of the USBR land around the lake would be identified as NSO. As a result, new wells would be required to be directionally drilled from outside the boundary of USBR land. There would be no change from Alternative A on the Carson and Santa Fe National Forests, except for the application of the Noise Policy in designated areas on USFS land.  2-232   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE C  Land Ownership Adjustments Disposal Under this alternative, the isolated tracts (approximately 2,640 acres) previously identified and BLM lands south and west of US 550 would remain available for disposal. In addition, the public lands on Crouch Mesa between Aztec, Bloomfield and Farmington (Map 2-5) would be added to the list for disposal. Exchange, sale, disposal under the R&PP act, or other legal disposal would be considered if the disposal met the criteria listed in Chapter 1. Table 2-1 provides the disposal acreage under this alternative. Acquisition Inholdings and lands surrounding SDAs would be the priority for acquisition. Additional riparian areas would also be a priority for acquisition, if their acquisition is determined by the Authorized Officer to be in the public interest. Other lands that consolidate public ownership or benefit a resource program could also be acquired. Any lands acquired would be managed in the same manner as the adjacent or surrounding public lands. Table 2-1 provides acquisition acreage under this alternative. ROW Corridors Under this alternative, the ROW corridors identified by the 2002 WUG revision of the 1992 WRCS would be designated for powerline and pipeline use. Any specific proposals would still be required to go through the environmental and permitting process. Proposed uses that are determined to unreasonably interfere with the use of these corridors may not be authorized. Map 2-2 shows the general alignment of the corridors. Mineral Materials The FFO has identified six areas (16,520 acres) of salable minerals such as sand and gravel that needs to be well managed. Additional areas could be identified in the future. Some of these areas are within the disposal area identified above. The purpose of delineating these areas is to inform managers and potential users of other resources in these  areas of their value for salable minerals, so that value would be considered prior to the authorization of other actions.  OHV Use OHV management would be similar to Alternative B. Management Unit boundaries would be the same as Alternative B, shown in Map 2-6. Acreage for each OHV designation is provided in Table 2-2. The table reflects changes in proposed SDAs for this alternative that would slightly alter the acreage for each designation. Proposed designated trails described for Alternative B would also apply for this alternative (Table 2-9). OHV use would be limited to maintained roads, designated trails, routes, and areas on public lands in all OHV Management Units. Some SDAs would be closed to vehicular use. Additional routes, trails, areas, and final alignments may be identified as plans are developed for each OHV Management Unit. OHV Activity Plans would be written based on priority of resource protection needs and the amount of public use. The individual OHV Activity Plans should be completed within 15 years. In addition to the preparation of the OHV Activity Plans, the FFO will prepare a Transportation Plan. The Transportation Plan will identify collector and resource roads that would be needed for use over the long-term. These roads would remain open for public access when oil and gas development in the area ceases. Roads identified in the Transportation Plan would be included in the individual OHV Activity Plans.  Specially Designated Areas Under Alternative C, 903,309 acres in the FFO would have special management, of which BLM currently owns the surface on 713,710 acres. Areas with special administrative designations (SMAs, ACECs, RNAs, WAs, and WSAs) approved through previous land use planning would be carried forward with changes described below. Accounting for these changes, there would be 141 SDAs in the FFO under Alternative C. This reflects consolidation of several areas into larger contiguous areas to  2-233   CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE C  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  provide for more efficient management. Changes in management prescriptions for new and existing areas are described in Table 2-5. Map 2-10 (large fold-out map for Alternative C, located at end of document, inside back cover) shows adjusted boundaries under this alternative. Please refer to Table 2-5 for name changes. Areas Not Carried Forward  Lost Pine, Log Jam, and Badlands ACEC designations would be removed since they are within the Bisti/De-NaZin WA and require no further designation. The Coal Belt SMA would be remo because all areas that are suitable coal would be available consideration for extraction under lease by application process. ved for for the    Rosa Mesa Wildlife Area would be added for protection of deer winter range. Gonzales Mesa Wildlife Area would be added for protection of deer winter range. Crow Mesa Wildlife Area would be added for deer and elk use all year. Cox Canyon Wildlife Area would be added for protection of deer winter range. Ensenada Mesa Wildlife Area would be added for year-long use by antelope, deer and elk. Cereza Canyon Wildlife Area would be added for protection of deer and elk winter range. Manzanares Mesa Wildlife Area would be added for protection of deer and elk winter range. Delgadito Mesa Wildlife Area would be added to provide for resident and migratory deer and elk. Angel Peak Wildlife Area would be added for antelope habitat. Laguna Seca Mesa Wildlife Area added for wild turkey, deer, elk, bear and Abert's squirrel.                  The Right-of-Way Windows (4 units) would be removed. Farmington Lake Watershed SMA would be removed because the majority of the ownership is non-federal, and a small portion is within the GRTS. Aztec Gilia ACEC designation would be removed, as the range and distribution of Aztec gilia is more extensive than previously identified. Tanner Lake Battlefield was dropped because surface ownership was transferred to The Navajo Nation as part of the Navajo-Hopi land exchange.           T&E Species  The Ephemeral Wash Riparian Area would be added to provide protection of riparian resources. Management would be applied to promote the attainment and maintenance of proper functioning conditions and provide habitats for the southwestern willow flycatcher. Within the Laguna Seca Mesa SMA would be the Mexican Spotted Owl ACEC, designated to protect the T&E habitat values in the critical habitat designated by the USFWS.  Areas Added or Changed Wildlife  East La Plata Wildlife Area would be added for protection of deer winter range. Rattlesnake Canyon Wildlife Area would be added for deer winter range and fall/winter use by wild turkeys. Middle Mesa Wildlife Area would be added for protection of deer winter range.        2-234   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE C  Cultural All cultural SMAs carried forward from previous plans and amendments would be designated as ACECs.

Star Spring ACEC would be enlarged and renamed Star Springs-Jesus Canyon ACEC. Martinez Canyon ACEC would be enlarged.    reflect the area of current use. This would result in a reduction in acreage. Pion Mesa Recreation Area would be designated for recreational, paleontological, and visual values. There would be several trails with different types of use. The managed area would include the corridors and surrounding land. Rock Garden Recreation Area would be designated for recreational values. The area would be for OHV, equestrian and other recreational use on designated trails, routes and areas. Management would be applied to the trails and surrounding land. Navajo Lake Horse Trail would be designated for recreational values, promoting equestrian use. The managed area would include the corridors and surrounding land. Alien Run Mountain Bike Trail would be designated for recreational values, and non-motorized use on trail corridors and surrounding land. The boundary of Thomas Canyon Recreation Area would be enlarged and a wildlife management component would be added to the larger SMA, in addition to the current recreational emphasis. In addition to current recreational emphasis, Carracas Mesa Recreation Area would add a wildlife management component in addition to the current recreational emphasis.    Historic Sites  Albert Mesa ACEC would be added.   The Haynes Trading Post ACEC would be added. The Moss Trail ACEC would be added.  Paleontology  The Pion Mesa Fossil Area would be added to protect significant paleontological values.  Gobernador and Cereza Canyon Fossil Area would be added to protect significant paleontological values. The Lybrook Fossil Area would be added to protect significant paleontological values. The Bohanon Canyon Complex would be added to protect significant paleontological values. The Carson Fossil Pocket would be added to protect significant paleontological values. The Kutz Canyon Paleontological Area would be expanded to protect significant paleontological values.                  Recreation  Simon Canyon ACEC would be expanded to include the portion of the Simon Canyon Recreation Area that extends beyond the ACEC boundary. The SMA designation would be removed and the area would be managed as an ACEC.  The GRTS name would change to Glade Run Recreation Area and the boundary would be changed to better  Coal Leasing Suitability Assessment Preference Right Leasing Application The 14 PRLAs discussed in Alternative A would be carried forward under this alternative. The unsuitability criteria that limited several PRLAs would still be in effect. Those PRLAs that are affected by Congressional designation of the WA and RNA may, under public law, be exchanged for coal leases in New Mexico if it is in the public interest. At the time any of the  2-236   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE C  PRLAs are processed, the unsuitability criteria would be applied again, if necessary. The acres in Ah-shi-sle-pah WSA would not be available for future coal leasing and development until Congress reaches a decision on the Ah-shi-sle-pah WSA status. Competitive Coal Tracts The 17 competitive coal tracts would not be available for leasing and coal development under this alternative. Existing coal mines would continue to extract from existing coal leases until recovery of in-place coal reserves are complete. The existing La Plata, San Juan, and McKinley Mines would not be able to expand their existing mining operations. The potential for coal mines and a power generating plant in the southern portion of the FFO would no longer exist. Approximately 560 million tons  of mineable federal coal would not be recovered. License to Mine [Home Use Fuel (Coal) Source] The need for domestic home fuel needs would continue as identified in Alternative A. The historic use of coal from surface outcrops by Navajo allottees in the area would continue. New domestic coal license applications would be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Fire/Fuels Management Fire/fuels management procedures under Alternative C would be the same as Alternative A, except in the number of acres in SDAs. Under this alternative, 713,710 acres of public land would fall under the guidance for these areas. Other areas would be managed in accordance with the procedures described for Alternative A.  2-237   CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE D  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  Alternative D Alternative D includes aspects of the other three alternatives, with the goal of balancing extraction of the mineral resource, multiple uses of public lands, and protection of natural and cultural resources. The goal of this alternative is to have full field subsurface development, as described in the RFDS, while minimizing surface disturbance to the extent possible.  Oil and Gas Leasing and Development This alternative development of 9,94 planning area, after the inaccessible due to would provide 2 new wells in 28 wells that would NSO constraints for the be are  subtracted from the total. This would include some commingling as projected in the RFDS (Engler et al. 2001). Commingling would be encouraged where possible, including consideration of opportunities to combine oil and gas operations across leases and between different companies. The theme of this alternative would focus on permitting mineral production while mitigating impacts to other resources. The number of APDs to be approved would be approximately 500 per year over the next 20 years. Following is a summary of the acreage of federal minerals in the planning area subject to various constraints under this alternative:  Constraint Leasing Nondiscretionary Closure Discretionary Closure Development STC CSU NSO TL Note:  Acreage within High Development Area 349 35,000 1,218,650 206,668 20,041 419,386  Acreage in Rest of Planning Area 110,799 46,000 1,378,543 80,242 5,401 64,421  Total Acreage 111,148 81,000 2,597,193 286,910 25,442 483,807  STC = Open under Standard Terms and Conditions; CSU = Controlled Surface Use; NSO = No Surface Occupancy; TL = Seasonal Timing Limitation.  Within the high development area, more than 99 percent of the federal oil and gas resources are currently leased. In areas being considered for discretionary closure in the RMP, the development of existing leases would continue according to the terms of the lease. The BLM would continue to implement the portions of the lease that require lessees to conduct operations in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts to other resources and other land uses and users. Mitigation of impacts would be accomplished by the application of the following new technology, regulatory changes, and off-site mitigation, as appropriate (practical and reasonable) to reduce the footprint from  each proposed well. This framework would be applied on a case-by-case basis for each proposed well, in addition to the implementation of the continuing management guidance that is common to all alternatives.  New TechnologyConstruction and Production Techniques: coil tube drilling for CBM wells, directional drilling from existing pads, use of remote sensing and telemetry to reduce traffic, surface use of produced water (could apply off-site) to create riparian and wetland habitats, transport injected produced water via pipeline instead of trucking to reduce traffic, closed loop mud systems.  2-238   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE D    Regulatory ChangesStandardize the drilling window off-sets in the federal units; encourage/permit dual completion, re-completion and commingling (both downhole and at the surface), from multiple producing formations, to reduce the total number of well pads; consider the creation of additional federal units. Off-Site MitigationUtilize the voluntarily contributed funding from the oil and gas industry to monitor impacts, develop adaptive management strategies, implement management prescriptions in the SDAs, and enhance resource conditions off-site. Contributed funds could be utilized to:  Monitor impacts to vegetation, soil, water, air, wildlife and habitats;  Purchase and construct signs, gates, access and property within SDAs;  Stabilize and interpret significant cultural resources;  closed loop mud systems. Pipelines would follow existing roads.  Development would be restricted in areas that have special topographic (steep or broken and/or on benches) and soil concerns. Development in these areas would be considered on a case-by-case basis and would contain site-specific mitigation stipulations. Operators would be encouraged to unitize in areas of heavy development to increase management efficiency and facilitate operations in sensitive areas. Off-site mitigation may be indicated in crucial areas, such as areas with wildlife monitoring or studies, habitat replacement, water development, and watershed protection measures.         Enhance habitats and meet public land health standards through vegetation manipulation, creation of additional water sites, application of produced water for riparian areas and wetlands, construction of structures and facilities to support site-specific management objectives such as kiosks, interpretive sites, parking areas, gates, fences, signs, etc. The mitigation measures described under Alternative C that minimize erosion and wildlife habitat disturbance would be implemented where applicable, depending on site-specific conditions and requirements. They include the following:  Make every effort to minimize surface disturbance and intrusion into undisturbed areas through such actions as twinning of wells and directional drilling, unorthodox locations, recompletions, commingling of gas, and  Vehicle traffic and resource damage would be reduced by using new technology such as electronic data interchange and piping of produced water. Listed below is a summary of the types of activities that would not be permissible during a closure period in an area under TL constraints. Emergency repairs needed for human safety and environmental contamination would not require prior authorization. Emergency repairs can include downhole or surface equipment repairs and/or modifications necessary to sustain the productive capability of the well.  Any construction, including new well pads, roads, pipelines, installation of compressors, surfacing of roads, powerlines. Well pad, road construction and road improvement. Drilling. Plugging and abandonment (unless required to prevent environmental damage). Seismic exploration. Workovers or any activity requiring a drilling rig, unless required to prevent environmental damage, or to permanent loss of reserves. Prior          2-239   CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE D  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  approval must be approved before beginning this type of work. Activities that are routine and do not conflict with the seasonal restrictions include routine daily operations, road maintenance, and routine pipeline maintenance. Noise from oil and gas compressors has been identified by the public as an issue of primary concern in the planning area. To address these concerns, the FFO developed a Noise Policy, which would be implemented in the form of an NTL to oil and gas operators or ROW that would require mitigation of noise levels measured within and adjacent to designated NSAs or within a specified distance from designated point receptors. Receptor-focused controls would apply to specific locations within 46 BLM and four USFS designated areas. Boundary-focused controls would apply to all designated acreage within 7 BLM, 3 USFS, and 1 NPS NSAs. All USBR land would be considered a boundary-focused NSA. For receptor-focused NSAs, the noise standard of 48.6 dBA Leq would be achieved within 100 feet of agency-established receptor points within the designated NSAs. Established receptors are generally defined as visitor use areas, camp or picnic areas, habitat for threatened or endangered species, archaeological sites, and recreation trails, and may vary in size from a single point to several acres based on the features and resource components being managed. In boundary-focused NSAs, the standard would be 48.6 dBA Leq, at 400 feet in all directions from the noise source. For noise sources located outside of designated NSAs, the noise standard of 48.6 dBA Leq would be met at the boundary of the NSA. Noise sources located within 400 feet of the NSA boundary would generally be allowed to meet the standard 400 feet from the source. For noise sources involving federal or Indian leases located near occupied dwellings or buildings, the standard of 48.6 dBA Leq would be met 100 feet from such structure.  Additional information on the Noise Policy is included in Appendix E. In addition to implementation of the Noise Policy, the raptor noise policy to minimize noise impacts from wellhead compression on raptor nest sites would be implemented as described under Alternative A. Oil and gas development on the land around Navajo Reservoir would be managed under NSO constraints in the following areas: Within 1,500 feet of Navajo Dam and its appurtenant structures;  Within 500 feet of the maximum high water line (elevation 6,101.5 feet above MSL);  Within 500 feet of the San Juan River;  On all new leases. The remainder of the area would be managed under CSU constraints. Unless exempted by USBR, there would be a timing limitation applied to the entire area from December 1 through March 31, and all USBR land would be managed as a boundary-focused NSA. Production facilities would not be located on the ridgeline above the reservoir and would be designed to minimize their visibility from the lake and other public use areas. Co-location of gas well facilities would be encouraged to minimize surface disturbance and the duplication of facilities.   Land Ownership Adjustments Disposal Under this alternative, all of the land identified for disposal in Alternative A would be available. In addition, the lands on Crouch Mesa and the lands along and less than one mile east of US 550 between Aztec and Bloomfield (Map 2-5) would be a priority for disposal. Exchange, sale, disposal under the R&PP Act or other legal disposal would be considered if the disposal met the criteria listed in Chapter 1. Additional areas identified by the various governmental entities and non-profit organizations during the scoping process for R&PP purposes (Appendix H) may be available for disposal if determined by the Authorized  2-240   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE D  Officer to be in the public interest. In some instances, the FFO would consider disposal of parcels within SDAs. Decisions would be based on an evaluation of the overall public benefit served by either disposal or continued management of special resource values. Identified parcels on which substantial improvements have been inadvertently placed would be made available for disposal, if the Authorized Officer determines that such disposal would be in the public interest. Table 2-1 provides the disposal acreage under this alternative. Acquisition Inholdings and lands surrounding SDAs would be the priority for acquisition. Additional riparian areas would also be a priority for acquisition, if their acquisition is determined by the Authorized Officer to be in the public interest. Other lands that consolidate public ownership or benefit a resource program could also be acquired. Any lands acquired would be managed in the same manner as the adjacent or surrounding public land. Table 2-1 provides the acquisition acreage under this alternative. ROW Corridors Under this alternative, the ROW corridors identified by the 2002 WUG revision of the 1992 WRCS would be designated for powerline and pipeline use. Any specific proposals would still be required to go through the environmental and permitting process. Proposed uses that are determined to unreasonably interfere with the use of these corridors may not be authorized. Map 2-2 shows the general alignment of the corridors. The 2002 WUG revision of the 1992 WRCS proposed corridors as shown on Map 2-2 would be the designated ROW corridors for the FFO. In most cases, these corridors follow the routes of existing major electric transmission lines or petroleum transportation pipelines.  The goal of designating proposed corridors is to facilitate the transport of energy-related resources and products while minimizing environmental impacts to all lands. The FFO would encourage the use of the designated ROW corridors and ROW use areas, to the extent possible, but depending upon on sitespecific needs, actual locations may vary. Utility corridors can often accommodate other compatible uses such as maintenance roads and other facilities, thus minimizing the proliferation of separate ROWs. Designation of ROW corridors does not eliminate the requirement for the environmental analysis of any new ROW project proposals. The designated corridors would function as the agency preferred location for future ROWs. Future proposals may benefit from the surveys and impact analyses conducted for existing projects. ROW proposals outside of designated corridors would not be excluded. However, such proposals may entail greater scope of analyses and increased time necessary to analyze impacts and alternative routes. Activities which would generally be excluded from ROW corridors include mineral material sales, range and wildlife habitat improvements involving surface disturbance or facility construction (such as water catchments, corrals, holding pens), campgrounds and public recreational facilities or other facilities which would attract public use. New oil and gas wells would be sited outside of ROW corridors. Fourteen SDAs that would be within or adjacent to proposed WUG corridors are listed in Table 2-11. In most cases, the designated SDA is of such small size and/or steep topography that linear energy projects could be routed around these areas. This table identifies proposed management of ROW applications in each SDA.  2-241   CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE D  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  Table 2-11 SD As in Prox ity to WU G Corr dors . im i SDA Name The Hogback Pion Mesa Fossil Area Glade Run Rattlesnake Canyon Crow Mesa Dzil'na'oodlii (Huerfano Mesa) Lybrook Fossil Area Torrejon Fossil Fauna North Road Segment #2 ROW Prescription Allowed with site-specific stipulations.

North Road Segment #7 San Luis Cliffs Window Betonnie Tsosie Bi Yaazh  Cultural River Tracts  The developed network of existing facilities throughout and across the FFO provides an effective network for using corridors to transport hydrocarbons, and electrical energy resources across or out of the San Juan Basin. This network, in conjunction with the designated utility corridors, should accommodate future ROW needs for the next 10-15 years. Thus, the designation of SDAs in the Farmington RMP will have minimal to no adverse impacts to either interstate or intrastate transportation of energy products. Mineral Materials The FFO has identified six areas (16,520 acres) of salable minerals (Map 2-8) such as sand and gravel that needs to be well managed. Additional areas could be identified in the future. Some of these areas are within the disposal area identified above. The purpose of delineating these areas is to inform managers and potential users of other resources in these areas of their value for salable minerals, so that  value would be considered prior to the authorization of other actions.  OHV Use OHV management would be similar to Alternative B. Management unit boundaries would be the same as Alternative B, shown in Map 2-6. Acreage for each OHV designation is provided in Table 2-2. The table reflects changes in proposed SDAs for this alternative that would slightly alter the acreage for each designation. Restrictions on cross-country travel described in Table 2-3 would apply. Proposed designated trails described for Alternative B (Table 2-9) would also apply for this alternative. Table 2-10 quantifies the amount of land in each Management Unit that may potentially be considered suitable for open designation as OHV Management Unit plans are developed. These areas could be further reduced depending on site-specific sensitivities as described under Alternative B.  2-242   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVE D  OHV Activity Plans would be written based on priority of resource protection needs and the amount of public use and should be completed within 15 years. In addition to the preparation of the OHV Activity Plans, the FFO will prepare a Transportation Plan. The Transportation Plan will identify collector and resource roads that would be needed for use over the long-term. These roads would remain open for public access when oil and gas development in the area ceases. Roads identified in the Transportation Plan would be included in the individual OHV Activity Plans. To improve management of roads used for oil and gas, the AFO would establish a road Management Unit in the Lindrith/Cuba area patterned after the OHV Management Units in the FFO Transportation Plan.  coal would be available for consideration for extraction under the lease by application process.   The Right-of-Way Windows (4 units) would be removed. Farmington Lake Watershed SMA would be removed because the majority of the ownership is non-federal, and a small portion is within the GRTS. Aztec Gilia ACEC designation would be removed, as the range and distribution of Aztec gilia is more extensive than previously identified. Tanner Lake Battlefield was dropped because surface ownership was transferred to The Navajo Nation as part of the Navajo-Hopi land exchange.      Specially Designated Areas Under Alternative D, 811,810 acres in the FFO would have special management, of which BLM currently manages the surface on 649,470 acres. Areas with special administrative designations (SMAs, ACECs, RNAs, WAs, and WSAs) approved through previous land use planning would be carried forward with changes described below. Accounting for these changes, there would be 137 SDAs in the FFO under Alternative D. This reflects consolidation of several areas into larger contiguous areas to provide for more efficient management. Changes in management prescriptions for new and existing areas are described in Table 2-5. Map 2-11 (large fold-out map for Alternative D, located at end of document, inside back cover) shows adjusted boundaries under this alternative. Please refer to Table 2-5 for name changes. Areas Not Carried Forward  Lost Pine, Log Jam and Badlands ACEC designations would be removed since they are within the Bisti/De-NaZin WA and require no further designation. The Coal Belt SMA would be removed because all areas that are suitable for  Areas Added or Changed Wildlife  The East La Plata Wildlife Area would be added for protection of deer winter range.

Within the Laguna Seca Mesa SMA would be the Mexican Spotted Owl ACEC, designated to protect the T&E habitat values in the critical habitat designated by the USFWS.           Cultural  All cultural SMAs carried forward from previous plans and amendments would be designated as ACECs.    Chacoan Outliers  Twin Angels ACEC would be enlarged.  Jacques ACEC would be enlarged and renamed as Jacques Chacoan Community ACEC.       Kiva ACEC would be enlarged. Muoz Canyon ACEC would be added. Pointed Butte SMA would be enlarged and designated as an ACEC. Pork Chop Pass ACEC would be added upon acquisition of state land and mineral rights. Rincon Largo District SMA would be enlarged and designated as an ACEC. Rincon Rock Shelter SMA would be enlarged and designated as an ACEC. Star Rock ACEC would be added.

The Carson Fossil Pocket would be added to protect significant paleontological values. The Kutz Canyon Paleontological Area would be expanded to protect significant paleontological values.    Recreation  Simon Canyon ACEC would be expanded to include the portion of the Simon Canyon Recreation Area that extends beyond the ACEC boundary. The SMA designation would be removed and the area would be managed as an ACEC. The GRTS boundary would be changed to better reflect the area of current use. This would result in a reduction in acreage. Pion Mesa Recreation Area would be designated for recreational, paleontological, and visual values. There would be several trails with different types of use. The managed area would include corridors and surrounding land. Rock Garden Recreation Area would be designated for recreational values. The area would be designated for OHV, equestrian and other recreational use on designated trails, routes and areas. Management would be applied to the area including trails and surrounding land. Navajo Lake Horse Trail would be designated for recreational values, promoting equestrian use. The managed area would include corridors and surrounding land. Alien Run Mountain Bike Trail would be designated for recreational values, and non-motorized use on trail corridors and surrounding land. The boundary of Thomas Canyon Recreation Area would be enlarged and  Petroglyph and Pictograph Sites  Bi Yaazh ACEC would be enlarged.  The existing Delgadita-Pueblo Canyons ACEC and Delgadito Pueblito SMA would be combined with surrounding lands into the Delgadita-Pueblo Canyons ACEC (360 acres). Hummingbird Canyon ACEC would be added. Star Spring ACEC would be enlarged and renamed Star Springs-Jesus Canyon ACEC. Martinez Canyon ACEC would be enlarged.

Coal Leasing Suitability Assessment Under this alternative there would be no shift in resource uses, but rather a balanced approach in the proposed leasing areas. Existing program policies and decisions for other resource programs would not change. The BLM would encourage and assist coal lessees and oil and gas lessees in their efforts to reach a cooperative development independently that would achieve the goals of both parties. Preference Right Leasing Applications The 14 PRLAs discussed in Alternative A would be carried forward under this alternative. The unsuitability criteria that affected several PRLAs would be in effect. Those PRLAs that are affected by Congressional designation of the WA and RNA may be exchanged for coal leases in New Mexico if it is in the public interest. At the time any of the PRLAs are processed, the unsuitability criteria would be reapplied on a site-specific basis. The area would not be available for future coal leasing and development until Congress reaches a decision on the Ah-shi-sle-pah wilderness status. Competitive Coal Tracts The 17 competitive coal tracts were discussed and available for leasing under Alternative A would be considered for leasing under this alternative. Those companies that are interested in mining coal from these tracts would submit an application to lease the coal and the 20 unsuitability criteria would be reapplied during the leasing process. It was determined that 378,285 acres would be suitable to consider for future leasing and development in the FFO area.  License to Mine [Home Use Fuel (Coal) Source] The need for domestic home fuel needs would continue as identified in Alternative A. It is assumed that the historic use of coal from surface outcrops by Navajo allottees in the area would continue. New domestic coal license applications would be considered on a case-bycase basis. Additional Coal Interests The two Peabody and BHP coal tracts identifying federal lands suitable for coal leasing described under Alternative B would be considered under this alternative. These lands are in the vicinity of Lee Ranch, Twin Peaks, and East Pion areas (see Map 2-4) for the location of these tracts. The 20 unsuitability criteria would be applied during the leasing process. In the Twin Peaks area, land acreage totaling approximately four sections in Township 30N Range 14W (Sections 10, 14, 15, 22 [NE  of NE ], 23 [E  and N  of the NW ], and 26 [NE  and N  of the SE ]) underlie the Pion Mesa Fossil Area and Pion Mesa Recreation Area. This land would not be available for coal mining. The remaining acreage in the Twin Peaks area would be available for coal mining with stipulations that protect paleontological resources, including paleontological surveys prior to underground mining and periodic monitoring during active underground mining to identify paleontological resources that may be exposed as a result of subsidence.  Fire/Fuels Management Fire/fuels management procedures under Alternative D would be the same as Alternative A, except in the number of acres under special administrative designation. Under this alternative, 649,470 acres of public land would fall under the guidance for these areas. Other areas would be managed in accordance with the procedures described for Alternative A.  2-246   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED  ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT ELIMINATED FROM DETAILED ANALYSIS Alternatives A, B, and C represent a range of possible management approaches to oil and gas leasing and development in the planning area and resource management in the FFO area. Alternatives considered and eliminated from detailed analysis are briefly described below. Prohibit any new oil and gas development on federal land in the planning area. This alternative was considered unreasonable because of the national need for energy resources and the BLM's legal mandate under the Mining and Minerals Policy Act of 1970 and the Minerals Policy Research and Development Act of 1980. Prohibit any new oil and gas development outside of the high intensity oil and gas area of the FFO. This alternative was rejected because it would severely limit access to available mineral reservoirs and is inconsistent with federal laws and mandates for multiple use of public lands. STCs and NSO provisions were considered adequate to protect sensitive environmental resources without completely prohibiting oil and gas development. Eliminate NSO restrictions in special management areas. This was not considered a reasonable alternative because it would result in violations of federal laws such as the Wilderness Act, ESA, NHPA, and FLPMA. Eliminate restrictions on placement of roads and pipelines. This alternative would eliminate the requirement to place roads and pipelines supporting oil and gas development within the same ROWs and allow new roads and pipelines to be constructed cross-country without restrictions. The alternative was rejected because the extreme surface disturbance that would result was considered inconsistent with BLM, USBR, and USFS policies for preserving resources and managing multiple uses. Eliminate all restrictions on OHV use in the planning area. This alternative was considered  unreasonable because the alternatives examined in detail provide for a wide range of OHV access, and removing all restrictions would subject special management areas to damage from OHV use that would jeopardize the resources those areas were established to protect.  Alternatives Proposed During Public Comment Period Public comments on the Draft RMP/EIS suggested two additional alternatives: one which would allow no new or no net increase in surface disturbance and another which would prohibit further leasing of oil and gas. These alternatives and the reasons they were eliminated from detailed analysis are described below. No New Surface Disturbance and No Net Increase in Surface Disturbance. Several comments were received on the Draft RMP/EIS requesting consideration of an alternative that would substantially reduce new well development and avoid associated environmental impacts. Specifically, commentors requested an alternative that would preclude further habitat fragmentation in wildlife management areas by limiting well pad, road, and pipeline construction. The FFO has considered such an alternative and determined that it is not practical or reasonable, for reasons explained in the following paragraphs. The planning area is comprised of a total of approximately 3 million acres of federal minerals. A little over half of this acreage is in the high development area for oil and gas. Within the high development area, more than 99 percent of the federal oil and gas resources are already leased, and many of those leases are held by production. The leaseholders have paid the federal government for the right to extract the minerals covered by those leases. The government, in turn, has entered into a contractual agreement to permit leaseholders to develop those resources. Leaseholders are, in fact, required by regulation to diligently develop and efficiently extract the resources covered by their leases.  2-247   CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  Approximately 128,000 acres of public land in the high development area are in existing Critical Big Game Habitat Management Areas. This could increase to as much as 397,000 acres under Alternative C. This is the acreage that would be subject to no new surface disturbance in an alternative designed to prohibit increased habitat fragmentation. Within the 397,000 acres, there are 4,528 existing oil and gas wells and 2,700 new wells projected for development. Assuming an average production of 1.12 billion standard cubic feet (Bscf) per well, if the 2,700 projected new wells were not permitted, the potential loss of production would be approximately 3,000 Bscf (27 percent) of the total production potential of the federal minerals in the region. At an estimated $3 per thousand cubic foot (NMDFA 2001), this would represent lost revenue of about $9 billion to the leaseholders. Precluding leaseholders from extracting these resources violates the BLM's contract responsibilities and would likely require compensation by the federal government. While it is not known what the extent of the compensation would be, it is clear from the numbers given above that the magnitude of the economic impact far exceeds a reasonable ability of the federal government to compensate leaseholders for the loss. In addition to economic issues, an alternative requiring no net increase in surface disturbance would prevent the orderly drainage of gas from underground formations and could lead to a violation of correlative rights. Linking new development to the rate of plugging and abandonment of old wells would cut the number of new wells to approximately one half that projected for the near future. This would result in a reduction of natural gas output from the Basin requiring existing customers to seek other sources of natural gas. Such an alternative would also run counter to National Energy Policy direction to meet increased demands for natural gas. Commentors proposing either a no new surface disturbance or no net increase in surface disturbance alternative do not present site-specific data to indicate which wildlife  populations would benefit from such an approach. There are virtually no pristine wildlife habitats in the FFO. Over 50 years of development have left no large blocks of unfragmented habitat. The BLM does not have scientific information to indicate which, if any, wildlife populations have declined due to oil and gas development. Mule deer have declined across their range in the West, including many areas without oil and gas development. Other species, such as elk, peregrine falcon, and wintering bald eagles have increased in the San Juan Basin during the past 20 years of ongoing oil and gas development. Additional oil and gas development and maintenance activities on State and private lands would continue to impact wildlife habitats within the San Juan Basin. In order to protect natural and cultural resources while enabling operations to extract minerals on public lands, the BLM has developed stipulations, BMPs, and constraints, such as timing constraints in the wildlife management areas, which are addressed in the COAs accompanying each APD. These provisions have been implemented in the past to reduce impacts to wildlife. They are expected to mitigate potential adverse impacts and reduce, though not eliminate, further habitat fragmentation. No Further Leasing. No further leasing of oil and gas has been proposed as an alternative that would reduce impacts of oil and gas development. In the Draft RMP/EIS, no new leasing was presented as a management prescription for some SDAs. However, due to the presence of prior existing leases, application of the prescription can only occur if leases expire. In addition, it is BLM policy (BLM Manual 3031.06A, Minerals Policy) ""...to keep public lands open to mineral exploration and development, unless closure or restriction is mandated by Congress or justified in the national interest."" Over 90 percent of the available lands in the planning area are already under existing oil and gas leases. Virtually all of the leases in the high development area of the planning area  2-248   Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  CHAPTER 2--ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED  were leased in the 1950s and 1960s and have been held by production. Prohibiting further leasing of Federal oil and gas in the planning area would not have any effect on the ongoing development of existing Federal leases or state or private leases. Lands that are presently available for leasing are generally on the fringes of the oil- and gas-producing region. Through the planning process, the lands with special values such as important cultural resources or crucial wildlife habitats have been designated as requiring special management prescriptions. In some cases these prescriptions indicate no  leasing for oil and gas or not re-offering leases if an existing lease is allowed to expire. Lands nominated for leasing are reviewed for the presence of potential conflicts with existing land use plans or other potential land use conflicts. If conflicts exist, the affected parcels are either withdrawn from the lease offering or special stipulations are attached to the lease. This procedure is effective in protecting sensitive resources while still allowing for the potential development of energy resources.  2-249   CHAPTER 2--COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVES  Farmington Proposed RMP/Final EIS  COMPARISON B, C, AND D  OF  ALT  ERNATIVES  A,  This section presents the impacts of the alternatives in comparative form to define the differences and provide a basis for choice among the options.

Bowling National Mine Reclamation Award in the non-coal   category for outstanding achievements in mined land reclamation.      The ceremony will be held on Wednesday, July 23, 2003, at the mine   site, which is located near Darlington Heights in Prince Edward County.      “We are very pleased that Kyanite Mining   Corporation received this much deserved national recognition for its exemplary   reclamation accomplishments at their Baker Mountain Mine site,” said DMME   Director Gene Dishner.    “The award represents Kyanite’s good working relationship   with its employees, its community and state government.”    The IMCC award is presented each year to a mine operation   that has demonstrated excellence in reclamation based on achievements in five   categories: compliance; contemporaneous reclamation; drainage control; bond   release (or reclamation success); and innovative practices.              The IMCC recognized the Baker Mountain Mine for   innovative reclamation practices, which included the creation of artificial   wetlands to help reclaim a 60-acre tailings pond.      The tailings pond had created acid mine drainage problems in a stream   that ran through the mining operation.    The   wetlands cells were installed to reclaim the acidic soils in the tailings   pond, and prevent and treat the acid mine drainage.      Since shortly after completion of the project, discharge from the pond   area has exceeded water quality standards.      Wildlife in the area is now flourishing.     “The Baker Mountain Mine reclamation project   demonstrates the way a responsible mining operation can protect and enhance   the environment if it is allowed the time and flexibility to do the job   right,” said company President and CEO Gene Dixon, Jr.      “It was our desire to reclaim the mine site in a manner that would   benefit the community for many years to come.      The success of this project was made possible by the efforts, ideas,   and expertise of our employees.”       The reclamation project successfully achieved the   company’s original post mining land use plan to develop wildlife habitat.      The habitat that has been established provides excellent food and cover   for quail, turkey, waterfowl, deer and a host of other mammals, reptiles, and   invertebrates.    A local bird club   has used the area for several birding trips and has identified a wide variety   of songbirds and waterfowl in areas that used to be barren mine spoils.      The company is currently developing plans to turn the site into a   mineral mining/reclamation museum and educational center.       Kyanite Mining   Corporation is the world’s largest and oldest producer of the refractory and   ceramic raw materials kyanite and mullite (calcined kyanite), which are used   in the manufacture of high temperature ceramics and electrical porcelains.      The Baker Mountain operation produced kyanite and mullite from   the mid-1920’s to 1979, and the plant used to produce the mullite was   operated until March 2002.    Mullite   has been milled and bagged for shipping at this facility for over half a   century.    Kyanite is still mined   and beneficiated by Kyanite Mining Corporation in Buckingham County, Virginia   – which is about 30 miles to the north of the original Baker Mountain   facility.     The Interstate Mining Compact Commission is a multi-state   governmental organization that represents the natural resource interests of   its member states.       # # #
