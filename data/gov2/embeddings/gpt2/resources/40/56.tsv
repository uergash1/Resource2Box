Language:  English  Descriptors: Animal welfare; Pain; Assessment  Abstract:  Judgements about pain and suffering in animals are required by the law of many countries and by many professional guidelines. Nevertheless, such assessments raise many problems, even in humans. Furthermore, an appeal to continuities between humans and other animals is clouded when, as is still the case, both the evolution and the function of a subjective sense of pain are obscure. Despite these difficulties, the criteria that lead to the judgement that a human is in pain can be generalized with substantial measure of agreement to other animals. This generalization is done on the basis of uncovering comparable mechanisms and comparable behaviour; then the whole cluster of features found in the animal is used to make the judgement. The less similar the animal to a human and the less complex it is, the more difficult is the assessment. The fuzziness of the boundary, between those animals that are judged to feel pain and those that are not does not invalidate the process of assessment. However, the extent to which an animal is given the benefit of the doubt clearly depends on the empathy a person feels for it as well as the type of ethical concerns that motivate the person.   69                             NAL Call.

Includes references.  Language:  English  Descriptors: Mice; Pain; Biliary calculi; Bioethics  Abstract:  An attempt was made to study the impact of clinically-observed abnormalities in mice with gallstones on the ethical admissibility of a proposed experiment using gallstone-bearing mice. Three groups of respondents completed a questionnaire based on a hypothetical protocol of a proposed experiment using gallstone-bearing mice. Differing information was given in the protocols concerning abnormalities in gallstone-bearing mice. Respondents were asked to judge, using a scoring system, the ethical admissibility of the proposed experiment and the degree of discomfort for the mice. Respondents were also asked to defend their admissibility judgements and discomfort scores. Respondents given clinical information considered the degree of discomfort to be more serious than respondents without such information. Respondents given information indicated that their estimate of discomfort was based principally on the clinical information provided. Respondents without clinical information mentioned the lack of such information as a handicap to assessing discomfort properly. Scores on ethical admissibility of the proposed experiment were found to be unaltered by the clinical information. Judgement of the ethical admissibility was based mainly on the anticipated human benefits to be gained by performing the experiment. It is stressed that the specific character of the present study does not allow generalisation of its outcome.   100                       NAL Call.

In the series analytic: Human understanding and animal awareness / edited by P.P.G. Bateson and P.H. Klopfer.  Includes references.  Language:  English  Descriptors: Hunting; Attitudes; Bioethics; Animal welfare; History  Abstract:  Throughout the history of Western culture, hunting has been a symbolic marker of the boundary between the human domain and the wild. Attitudes toward hunting have accordingly reflected changing views of the meaning of that boundary. In classical antiquity, the hunter was characteristically depicted as a warrior on the side of order, battling against the chaotic wilderness. Today, the wilderness is commonly admired as a locus of order and harmony, and the hunter is seen as a participant in that order (by hunters) or a threat to it (by opponents of hunting). This shift in attitudes toward the wilderness dates back to the eighteenth century, and it has been ascribed to reaction against the rise of industrial capitalism. However, antihunting sentiment materialized in Western literature 200 years before that. Its appearance in the Renaissance and its subsequent spread reflect the growth of doubts about the importance and significance of the human-animal boundary.   103                                  NAL Call.

In the series analytic: Human understanding and animal awareness / edited by P.P.G. Bateson and P.H. Klopfer.  Includes references.  Language:  English  Descriptors: Animal welfare; Moral values; Law  Abstract:  There is no coherent vision of the human-animal relationship that appears in the law. Rather, different laws reflect different priorities and different ideas about the importance of protection of animals when compared with the interests of humans. The different visions about the moral place of animals reflected in the laws correspond with different visions that members of human society have about the place of animals in the world. While there may be no coherent vision of the human/animal relationship that exists in the law, any single law can be seen as a compromise between the different visions that society has about animals. Historically, the law has treated animals as being fundamentally distinct from humans in a moral sense, and has placed relatively few controls on what humans can do to animals. Recent years have seen this situation change as more and more laws have been enacted to accord greater protection to animals. This change is essentially an adjustment by the law in the vision of the human-animal relationship that it adopts, moving from an extreme view that animals and humans are different to greater recognition of views that accord animals greater moral status. Yet the adjustment by the law has not been complete by any means, and the law has not gone nearly so far as to accord actual ""rights"" to animals. Instead, the law has increased its regulation of things that humans can do to animals and has created mechanisms by which humans can intervene in the legal system to protect animals. Whether the law will go the next step and allow animals to enter the legal system to protect their own interests appears doubtful, but remains to be seen.   132                                  NAL Call.

Includes references.  Language:  English  Descriptors: Rodents; Pups; Aggressive behavior; Mortality; Ethics; Experimental design; Stress  Abstract:  Studies of infanticide and maternal aggression in rodents are reviewed to exemplify general ethical problems arising from research on predation and aggression. Three main areas are reviewed: (1) parental infanticide, when an experimental manipulation causes a parent to harm its young; (2) non-parental infanticide, when pups are placed with a strange adult; and (3) non-parental infanticide, when a strange adult is placed with a mother and litter and aggression between adults may occur. Field experiments are also considered. In each area, constraints on experimental design produce ethical problems; however, ways of minimizing stress are considered. Factors of ethical concern include: (1) observation and intervention to stop both killing of infants and adult aggressive interactions; (2) numbers of pups used in each test; (3) age of the pups; (4) the nature of infanticidal attack; (5) maternal aggression; (6) duration of interactions; (7) use of barriers to protect pups and provision of escape routes for defeated adults; and (8) experimental design and sample sizes. The importance of considering ethical points early in experimental studies is emphasized.   152                              NAL Call. No.: QP1.A2 SUPPL.

Language:  English  Descriptors: Scientists; Ethics; Administration; Animal welfare; Corruption  Abstract:  Ethical issues are receiving considerable attention in the scientific community just as in other areas of society. Scientists who have in the past been accorded a select position in society are no longer guaranteed that status just by virtue of their occupation. Science, and scientists, may not yet be subject to the same intense scrutiny as some other professions, but the trend is evident. Scientists do have special obligations due to the nature of their profession, yet incidences of indiscretion are documented. Expectations of scientists in specific areas such as consulting, animal rights, and advocacy are discussed, and some thoughts on the scientist as an administrator are presented. A short summary of actions being taken in the field of ethics is included.   163                                 NAL Call. No.: TL720.7.A5 Ethics, animal rights, and air transport of animals.

Language:  English  Descriptors: Animal experiments; Ethics; Animal behavior; Field experimentation; Animal welfare  Abstract:  Field experiments have a central role in ethology and behavioural ecology, yet they engender peculiar ethical problems which are rarely addressed. Ethical concerns with such experiments are broadly classed into issues of suffering, the sanctity of life, individual rights', and conservation. The latter, involving manipulation of the animal's environment, is particularly important in field as distinct from laboratory experimentation. This paper seeks to stimulate debate about such ethical concerns amongst ethologists and behavioural ecologists. To do so, currently popular research methods in experimental field studies of behaviour are reviewed. Ethical concerns relevant to each methodology are then addressed.   181                             NAL Call. No.: HV4711.I6 1986 Fighting to win., 1st Perennial Library ed. Spira, H.

Genetic manipulation is defined within the wider area of biotechnology and some of the main benefits of its use are summarized; safety and risk are examined and some of the socioeconomic problems it can create are discussed. It is concluded that the technique can offer great potential benefits in terms of increased quantity and improved quality of food, but it raises social/ethical concerns which can be summed up by asking: Is it safe? Is it fair? Is it natural?   186                             NAL Call. No.: HV4711.I6 1986 Good dogs and other animals., 1st Perennial Library ed. Clark, S.R.L.

Includes references.  Language:  English  Descriptors: Animal welfare; Medical sciences; Research; Laboratory animals; Research policy  Abstract:  For centuries, opposition has been directed against the use of animals for the benefit of humans. For more than four centuries in Europe, and for more than a century in the United States, this opposition has targeted scientific research that involves animals. More recent movements in support of animals rights have arisen in an attempt to impede, if not prohibit, the use of animals in scientific experimentation. These movements employ various means that range from information and media campaigns to destruction of property and threats against investigators. The latter efforts have resulted in the identification of more militant animal rights bands as terrorist groups. The American Medical Association has long been a defender of humane research that employs animals, and it is very concerned about the efforts of animal rights and welfare groups to interfere with research. Recently, the Association prepared a detailed analysis of the controversy over the use of animals in research, and the consequences for research and clinical medicine if the philosophy of animal rights activists were to prevail in society. This article is a condensation of the Association's analysis.   189                                   NAL Call.

Language:  English  Descriptors: Egg production; Hens; Animal welfare; Vegetarianism; Ethics; Food beliefs  Abstract:  The egg, once regarded as the ideal protein food, is now becoming a questionable commodity. Some consumers believe that today's ""mass-produced"" eggs are not as flavorful as eggs produced in bygone times. The main concern is the egg's high cholesterol content and possible adverse effects of feed additive residues. No longer the barnyard roamer, chickens are packed into tightly arranged cages to lay eggs for two years and then are sold for food processing. A host of pesticides and antibiotics is used for disease prevention and increased production. These and other practices regarded by the author as inhumane are described. A brief discussion of egg alternatives, such as scrambled tofu, is included.(jd-b)   195                                  NAL Call.

Animal behaviour v. 36 (6): p. 1696-1707; 1988 Nov.  Includes references.  Language:  English  Descriptors: Animal welfare; Animal housing; Environment; Behavior patterns; Ethics; Intensive husbandry; Models  Abstract:  The increasingly widespread use of the term ethological 'need', implying that the welfare of animals in intensive husbandry systems will suffer if they are unable to express a normal range of behaviour patterns, has been criticized on the grounds that the term has not been clearly defined nor does it rest on a solid scientific foundation. In this critical review, evidence is presented which is consistent with the idea that there are cases in which the performance of behaviour itself does not motivationally significant consequences which are not necessarily related to functional requirements. For example, hens go through nest- building sequences during pre-laying behaviour, even though the nest they created previously is still available. This kind of finding is difficult to explain without involving the concept of ethological 'need'. Existing models of motivation are shown to be inadequate in explaining much of the behaviour seen in barren or impoverished environments, or when the animals are highly motivated in situations where consummatory behaviour is difficult to carry out. A modified model which can account for the occurrence of these stereotyped, abnormal and repetitive behaviour patterns is presented. The problems raised by equating the term 'need' with 'necessity' are discussed, particularly in the context of intensive environments where animals are faced with the task of occupying long periods of time with a limited range of behaviour patterns; the authors agree with Dawkins that one solution is its replacement by the concept of 'elasticity', but argue that the notion of 'necessity' may need to be broadened.   226                                 NAL Call.

Language:  English  Descriptors: Obesity; Health hazards; History; Cultural environment; Cultural change; Health care; Literature reviews  Abstract:  The concept that obesity is a risk to health was clearly identified in the works of Hippocrates and frequently over the ensuing centuries. Obesity was originally discussed as part of more general texts. Scholarly theses on this subject began to appear in the late 16th century with the first monographs published in the 18th century. The value of dietary restriction, increasing exercise and reducing the amount of sleep were identified early in medical history dating at least from the time of Hippocrates. These concepts were often framed in a manner which implied a 'moral' weakness on the part of the overweight individual. The most spectacular dietary success was published by a layman in 1863 and was the forerunner to many subsequent diet books. Cases of massive obesity were identified in stone age carvings and have been described frequently since the time of Galen and the Roman Empire. More specific types of obesity began to be identified in the 19th century. Following the identification of the cell as the basic building block of animals and plants, fat cells were described and the possibility that obesity was due to too many fat cells was suggested. After the introduction of the calorimeter by Lavoisier, the suggestion that obesity might represent a metabolic derangement has been suggested and tested. Standards for measuring body weight appeared in the 19th century. The possibility that familial factors might also be involved was clearly identified in the 18th and 19th century. In conclusion, most of the concepts which are currently the basis for research in the field of obesity had their origin in the 19th century and often earlier.   227                                NAL Call.

Language:  English  Descriptors: Animal welfare; Ethics; Philosophy  Abstract:  This article is not strickly one of vegetarianism, but one which vegetarianism is discussed as one consequence of a large augment concerning the rights of animals. This point is made by comparing and contrasting the views of Peter Singer and Tom Regan, two animal rights philosophers who were ethical vegetarians. Singer informs us of the abuse of animals in medical research as pets, as farm laborers, etc., and urges us to adopt vegetarianism and to work for the liberation of animals. In contrast, Regan defends animals, not on the grounds of the consequences of mistreating them, but on the grounds that animals have a right to fair treatment.(rah)   242                                  NAL Call.

Language:  English  Descriptors: Animal welfare; Animal behavior; Philosophy; Bioethics; Literature reviews  Abstract:  Currently there is an unprecedented interest in ethological studies of nonhuman animals. Much of this interest is motivated by a desire to learn more about animals themselves. For scientists assuming this stance, a secondary goal is to use this knowledge to assess the place of humans in the natural order of things, stressing continuity or discontinuity depending on one's views. Others, however, study animals primarily to apply this knowledge to human behavior. We argue that behavioral research demands the rigorous application of methods that are minimally harmful to the animals being studied. We argue for a moderate, but rigorous and uncompromising, position on issues of animal welfare. A number of areas that in our opinion require careful scrutiny before research should be permitted are identified. It is a privilege to study nonhumans even in what seem to be noninterventive situations, and we should reflect on what we are doing by empathizing with the animals that are being studied. From this point of view, ethological interest and philosophical concerns with morality, mind, and science complement one another. Thus, ethology and philosophy should inform one another with respect to the way in which animals are studied, and how data are analyzed, applied, and disseminated.   253                              NAL Call.
