Why Wetlands in the        Desert?         Early in 1990, the Arizona Department of Environmental        Quality (ADEQ) released the proposed Navigable Water Quality Standards        that significantly increased the water quality standards for discharges        into Arizona waterways. To meet these increasingly stringent standards, it        was estimated that it would cost $635 million to upgrade the        91 st  Avenue Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), which discharges        into the Salt River. Furthermore, this upgrade would not provide any        additional treatment capacity to the 153 million gallons per day (mgd)        output to the plant. This forced City officials to seek alternative        treatment processes to clean the valley's wastewater. One of the        first options the City considered was based on a 1992 unpublished        reconnaissance report from the  U.S.        Army Corps of Engineers  proposing using constructed wetlands to        alleviate some water related problems in central Maricopa County. The        report compared several alternatives and recommended a wetland project at        the convergence of the Salt, Gila, and Aqua Fria Rivers. The wetlands were        to provide water treatment for the 91 st  Avenue WWTP, create        wildlife habitat, and provide for flood protection for downstream        residents. Based upon the concept originated by the Corps, the        Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) and the City of Phoenix initiated the         Phoenix Water Reclamation and Reuse Study, Tres Rios Demonstration        Wetlands, Conceptual Design  report (1993). The report was written in        cooperation with the  Arizona        Game and Fish Department  (AGFD),  Arizona        Department of Environmental Quality  (ADEQ), Maricopa County Department        of Parks and Recreation, Maricopa County Flood Control District, and the        United States  Environmental        Protection Agency  (USEPA). The report focused on planning, design,        cost estimates, and environmental and regulatory processes needed to fully        research a wetland project.  By 1994, the City of        Phoenix had decided that it would cooperate with the BOR in constructing a        wetland project at the convergence of the Salt, Gila, and Aqua Fria        Rivers. The project was called, Tres Rios, which is Spanish for ""Three        Rivers."" The  primary objectives  of this project were to (1) test        the capability of constructed wetlands to treat effluent to meet the        expected future National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)        requirements, (2) to develop appropriate design criteria for a future        full-scale 800-acre wetland project in the Tres Rios area, which would        treat the entire 150 mgd of effluent discharged by the plant, and (3)        assess the net environmental benefit it would have on the three river        area.  Secondary objectives  included the (1) enhancement of        wildlife, and (2) to serve as an education and passive recreation resource        for the community. The source water for Tres Rios is treated        wastewater from the 91st Avenue WWTP which is located in southwest Phoenix        on the northern bank of the Salt River. The treatment plant is operated by        the City of Phoenix on behalf of the Multi-City Sub-Regional Operating        Group (SROG), a consortium of cities including  Glendale ,         Mesa ,          Phoenix ,  Scottsdale ,        and  Tempe .        The plant discharges approximately 150 mgd (168,000 acre-feet per year)        with up to 105,000 acre-feet pipelined (under contract) to the Palo Verde        Nuclear Power Plant. Effluent not sent to Palo Verde is discharged        directly into the Salt River. The Buckeye Irrigation District further        diverts 30,000 acre-feet from the Salt River 7 miles downstream and uses        it for agriculture. In the spring of 1995, construction began on        the wetland systems. The wetlands consisted of three discrete wetland        sites that had a total area encompassing 12 acres of free-water surface        treatment wetlands. They were called the Cobble site, the Hayfield site,        and the Research Cell site. Additionally, the continuous outflow of water        from the Hayfield site has helped to sustain approximately 1 mile of        riparian habitat along the Salt River. This area contains large cottonwood        (Populus Fremontii) and willows (Salix Goodings) as well as nonnative        species such as Salt Cedar (Tamarisk).

The program is overseen and funded by a grant from the                  U.S. State Department to encourage citizen participation in local                  government, signaling a positive shift in the United States' relationship                  with China.                In April 2001, nine students and two teachers from Chengdu's                  Shude High School arrived in Phoenix.  During their three-week                  visit they studied various aspects of Phoenix city government, observing                  meetings on topics such as youth programs, volunteerism, citizen                  involvement and budgeting.  Afterwards, 9 students from Central                  High School in Phoenix traveled to Chengdu to study Chinese city                  government for three weeks.                 Phoenix was the only U.S. city to participate this year.                   Thanks to the success of this year's pilot program, the city                  of Phoenix has received a second year of funding for another exchange                  to take place during summer 2002.                    In addition to participating in this exchange with Chengdu,                  Central High School is a magnet school focusing on international                  programs.  The school also promotes interest in Chinese culture                  with newly created Mandarin language classes.                Students continue to communicate with each other through                  message boards and chat rooms.  Shude High School students                  and teachers created a website at  http://exchangecpu.yeah.net                   where they share information on their exchange experiences and will                  post details on their community service activities.  Central                  High School students also have a website at  http://www.globalc.org/puhsd/central/                   with detail on their experiences with the project.                 On November 14, students in both Phoenix and Chengdu                  participated in an environmental restoration project. Students in                  China lobbied their government to clean up the polluted Fu Nan River.                   When the government finally agreed, it asked for the students'                  help — and students from Shude High School in Chengdu will                  plant trees on the banks of the Fu Nan river.  In Phoenix,                  on the same day, Central high School students worked on their own                  tree planting project at Tres Rios.

The grant was announced November 28, 2000 by Gov. Jane Hull. The revitalization program is the first of its kind in the nation.  The initiative, called Arizona's Compact to Improve Neighborhood, or ACTION, was announced by Governor Hull a year ago. Since then, 19 communities throughout the state, including 10 in the Valley, offered proposals for a first round of funding.  The goal is to encourage communities to take comprehensive approaches to crime, drugs, housing and job training at once.  For more information on ACTION, contact the Governor's office at (602) 542-4331.    The next Breakfast With Bilsten will be January 25, at the PV Mall Coco's, 4514 East Cactus Road.

The program is overseen and funded by a grant from the                  U.S. State Department to encourage citizen participation in local                  government, signaling a positive shift in the United States' relationship                  with China.                In April 2001, nine students and two teachers from Chengdu's                  Shude High School arrived in Phoenix.  During their three-week                  visit they studied various aspects of Phoenix city government, observing                  meetings on topics such as youth programs, volunteerism, citizen                  involvement and budgeting.  Afterwards, 9 students from Central                  High School in Phoenix traveled to Chengdu to study Chinese city                  government for three weeks.                 Phoenix was the only U.S. city to participate this year.                   Thanks to the success of this year's pilot program, the city                  of Phoenix has received a second year of funding for another exchange                  to take place during summer 2002.                    In addition to participating in this exchange with Chengdu,                  Central High School is a magnet school focusing on international                  programs.  The school also promotes interest in Chinese culture                  with newly created Mandarin language classes.                Students continue to communicate with each other through                  message boards and chat rooms.  Shude High School students                  and teachers created a website at  http://exchangecpu.yeah.net                   where they share information on their exchange experiences and will                  post details on their community service activities.  Central                  High School students also have a website at  http://www.globalc.org/puhsd/central/                   with detail on their experiences with the project.                 On November 14, students in both Phoenix and Chengdu                  participated in an environmental restoration project. Students in                  China lobbied their government to clean up the polluted Fu Nan River.                   When the government finally agreed, it asked for the students'                  help — and students from Shude High School in Chengdu will                  plant trees on the banks of the Fu Nan river.  In Phoenix,                  on the same day, Central high School students worked on their own                  tree planting project at Tres Rios.

Today, June 14, 2001, Mark Warren Sands, 49, was arrested for a series of      arson fires involving new homes under construction in close proximity to mountain      preserve lands. Sands was arrested pursuant to a multi-count federal indictment      in connection with eight fires.      The arrest was the culmination of a lengthy investigation conducted by the Arson Task Force, which partnered the Phoenix Police Department, Phoenix Fire Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The Police Department joined the Fire Department in October 2000 when the complexity of the investigation dictated the need for additional manpower, resources and expertise.  The task force was brought to bear upon this community problem in December 2000, to provide a multi-disciplined approach and additional assets.  The Phoenix Police Department alone has expended over 30,000 man-hours in this investigation.  At various times, assets from 13 different police department units were utilized.  In addition, several other city departments assisted the investigative team.     The level of inter-agency cooperation should serve as the model for future      investigations of this sort. Information from investigators is that Sands      acted alone. I would like to extend my thanks to everyone involved in these      cases for their dedication and hard work.

The public can obtain  records,     communicate via e-mail with City Council members and city officials,      pay bills, apply for city jobs, join a mailing list, report graffiti, potholes      and other problems and gain access to a wealth of information ranging from      crime statistics  to parks locations to public events schedules. Providing     information from the public's point of view has been a hallmark of Phoenix's     philosophy regarding electronic access to     government. Today, more than     13,000 pages of information and interactive applications are online to serve     the public.      Some examples of the interactive nature of phoenix.gov include:           the  Electronic       Community Calendar , a calendar of events customizable by citizens,       ezAPP , a secure way to apply for a city job using a Web browser,       online payments  of water bills, parking tickets and oversize vehicle       permits        online subscriptions  to city jobs listings       the ability to  report neighborhood and street problems       the online  seamless service directory , which enables the public to obtain services using a wide variety of keywords       and topics         The goal                 of the city's Web site is to use  technology to     offer online as many                 of                 the                    same services that are available                    in               person as possible. Equally important is to use modern electronic     communications technology to increase accessibility to city services and     empower people      regardless of their socioeconomic status, age or physical disability      to     be able to fully participate in city government.     In 1994, Phoenix leaders saw an unprecedented     opportunity to give full and equal electronic access to government for all     citizens. With a $50,000 federal grant, the city created three public-access     computer     workstations and its Web site dubbed Phoenix At Your Fingertips, thus launching     its vision of the  Electronic     Community Access Model . That same year,  the Phoenix City Council adopted     the  City of Phoenix   Information Superhighway Policy . This policy recognizes the importance   of an advanced telecommunications framework to benefit the community, businesses   and government.     In 1995, the city received another federal grant for $225,000     to expand its electronic access to virtually every city resident.     It did so by providing public-access workstations within a     three-mile radius of every Phoenix neighborhood. In October 1996, 30 additional     workstations were installed at 27 sites including library branches, senior     and community centers and non-profit agencies. Four of these sites provide     service to the disabled community. By October 1997,  56 workstations   were installed at 37 sites.           Outreach a key objective            ECAM and the Information Superhighway Policy,       both then and now, envision using phoenix.gov to enable all people       from       all       walks       of       life to  interact with the         city. Nowhere is this more important than for people         who because of their socioeconomic status, age or a disability would   not have had a chance to interact as fully in city government matters.      This effort attempts to reach those who cannot afford a personal computer,     as well as members of the public who must rely on special assistive technology     due to a disability. Phoenix supports the philosophy     that the     World     Wide Web     Consortium,     also known as the W3C, sets forth for usability and accessibility. The W3C     is the international body that sets standards for the Web.      When the W3C  released its latest guidelines in December 2002,      the     organization      had this to say about accessibility: ""Access to the Web for people     with disabilities, however, presumes that Web developers choose accessible     design over inaccessible design..."" To that end, Phoenix's design standards     require that all pages be tested in special software to ensure that it is     usable     in such     devices as text-to-speech readers and that the code is compatible with the     special software that people with disabilities may use to view the Web. The     city's online forms and applications must also be usable from public-access     workstations. For example, all e-mail must be routed through special forms     that can accommodate the workstations, which do not have an e-mail application     on them.     Since 1995, Phoenix has partnered with special needs centers and non-profits     to  bring government to people who otherwise might face a disadvantage in     participating in city affairs.     Volunteers provide one-on-one training sessions to individuals with disabilities     and also to seniors. These     sessions are tailored to meet the unique needs of each individual.     Two special outreach programs were implemented to provide service to all     citizens. One program consists of training a group of senior citizen volunteers     called senior ""net"" trainers, which was completed in July 1996.     Net trainers are volunteers from the city's senior centers who have teaching     experience,     are computer literate and were given specialized instruction about phoenix.gov.     Since July 1996, net trainers have been providing training to other volunteer     seniors interested in becoming a ""computer buddy"" with a less-skilled     person. Computer buddies serve as hands-on instructors to clientele wishing     to learn     about workstation use. Training is individually tailored for each center     and the interested users. These net trainers and computer buddy volunteers     have provided nearly 20,000 hours of service.     The debut in 2000 of a redesigned     Web site represented       the       city's         strong commitment, since the very beginning of its foray into electronic     communications technologies, to increasing full public access to, and participation     in, government. That commitment     will     be reinforced     again     near     the end     of 2003 when a new Web Content Management System will bring new efficiencies     to and enhance  the delivery of services and information online.

Of special recognition are:       Phoenix Citizens      In 1988, the citizens of Phoenix approved a municipal bond program for the      city of Phoenix Information Systems. One of the projects, Office Automation      and Information Sharing, contributed funds for the creation of this project.       Phoenix At Your Fingertips  was designed to provide citizens with computerized      access to city information, which previously was available only through citizen      visits to government facilities or by telephone. The project's information      sharing element qualified it to receive some OA/IS bond-funded support.      United States Department      of Commerce, NTIA      In October 1994, a $50,000 federal grant was awarded to the city of Phoenix      to develop the Electronic Community Access Model. In October 1995, a $225,000      federal grant was awarded to the city to provide universal access and service      to all its citizens. Today,  phoenix.gov  represents a portion of ECAM      and was made possible in part by receipt of the two grants from the Telecommunications      and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program, National Telecommunications      and Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.      Arizona Bridge to Independent      Living (ABIL)      Serving as one of the first Phoenix sites  for a public workstation     equipped with assistive technology, ABIL's vision is the full community integration     and     participation     of individuals          with disabilities regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, age or disability.     ABIL's  mission is to provide programs designed to assist people with a variety     of      disabilities to achieve or continue independent lifestyles within their community.      Arizona Center for      the Blind and Visually Impaired, Inc.      Serving as a site for a public workstation equipped with assistive technology,      the center serves individuals who are blind and visually impaired and is one      of the sites selected for one of the public workstations with assistive technology.      The center's mission is to enhance the quality of life of people who are blind      or otherwise visually impaired by providing a wide range of services.      Foundation for Blind      Children      Serving as a site for a public workstation equipped with assistive technology,      the foundation's purpose is to provide education, counseling, independent          skills development, technology training, recreation and adapted materials      to blind and visually impaired children and their families. Through the     addition      of the new adaptive technology center, the foundation has expanded its mission      to include serving adults of all ages.       Information Technology Department      The Information Technology Department provides project management, implements      the tools and technology, converts and installs the documents and graphics,      creates standards and procedures and is responsible for the ongoing operation      of  phoenix.gov       Information Providers      City departments and functions provide the information contained in  phoenix.gov       and keep the information current and of value to Phoenix citizens.      Public Information Office      The Public Information Office reviews and edits  phoenix.gov  documents,      organizes the information into areas of interest and coordinates the graphics.      Volunteer Senior Net and Computer Buddy Trainers      In July 1996, 65 senior center volunteers and staff were trained in the use        of public-access workstations. These ""net trainers"" trained other        senior volunteers to be ""computer buddies."" These skilled seniors volunteer their time to assist senior center patrons in the use of  phoenix.gov .  In fact,         their volunteer time was accumulated as in-kind match to the federal        grant of $225,000, which equated to more than 20,000 hours of citizen time         dedicated to  phoenix.gov .      Handicapped Connection      Providing volunteer training at the Westside Family Center, the Handicapped      Connection is a community-based, non-profit corporation headquartered in Phoenix      that has been providing recreation and socialization services for developmentally      disabled persons since 1983.      MIDAK      In July 1996, 65 senior center volunteers and staff were trained by MIDAK      in the use of  Phoenix At Your Fingertips  workstations. MIDAK donated      their time, facilities and staff to provide this training for this project.      Muchmore & Wallwork      The law offices of Muchmore & Wallwork donated three public-access workstations      that soon were placed in neighborhood areas.      Telephone Pioneers of America      During the installation of the public-access workstations, volunteers from        the Telephone Pioneers of America installed approximately 3,000 feet of       cable        at 15 sites, which involved more than 260 hours of donated time.
