Codename: 'Bonnie' REV.F1 ATARI Corp. 1991   ATARI history     ATARI Corp.  was founded by Nolan Bushnell in 1972, where ' ATARI ' is  japanese  for "" I'm going to win! "" (deriving from the traditional board game ' Go! '). First plans, in which the company was to be called  'Syzygy'  (an astronomical term), fortunately failed because of copyright-reasons - still, the term  ' Syzygy engineered '  can be found on some early hardware serial number stickers.  Bushnell, however, needed a company to sell the legendary  Pong -videogame (in arcade-, later home-versions), which made  ATARI  the leading force of the videogame-market these days; also legendary became the later games, like  Breakout  (developed by  Steve Jobs , who worked for Bushnell these days!) and  Asteroids  (1979, launched to oppose  Taito 's  Space Invaders ). In  1977  the  VCS 2600  was introduced, a best-selling videogame-system, after  Nolan Bushnell  had sold  ATARI  to  Warner Bros.  in  1976  - without  Warner 's financial support,  ATARI  would probably have gone bankrupt because of the expensive  VCS development process .  Bushnell  remained CEO and then finally left  ATARI  in  1978 .  In the following years of the  videogame-boom ,  ATARI  led the competition, with both home- and arcade systems. But then, at the end of  1982  (the year in which  TIME  declared the personal computer 'Machine of the year', ironically), the videogame-market crashed from one day to another - the so-called ' videogame shakeout ' had begun. Even worse since  ATARI  had just launched the  ATARI 5200  SuperSystem , which was to become the  2600 's successor... Luckily,  ATARI  had already found their role in the upcoming  8 bit  computer-market by that time, with famous machines like the  ATARI 400/800  and their successors  1200XL ,  600XL  and  800XL . Nevertheless, they later tried to resurrect the  2600  again, with the  VCS 7800   PRO System ,   but failed - mainly because of  Nintendo 's technologically advanced  Entertainment System . In  1984  then,  ATARI  was split: computer- and videogame-divisions were sold to  Jack Tramiel  (called ' ATARI Technology Corp. ' from then on), the arcade-section was sold to  Namco  (forming ' ATARI Games Corp. ', see logo above).    With the  ATARI Technology Corp. ,  Tramiel  wanted to rival  Commodore  - a company he had founded himself, and which he had left because of some disputes with management. After failing to overtake  Amiga Inc.  (to prevent  CBM  from buying it),  ATARI  had to mothball the planned  1850XL  and a  high-end game-console  (both based on the  Amiga -chipset they had planned to license). So in  1985  they introduced the  ST-series  (' S ixteen- T hirtytwo', because of their 16/32 bit  Motorola 68000  CPU), finally entering the  16 bit-market  and following  Apple 's  Lisa  and  Macintosh  in many ways (that's why many people called it the ' Jackintosh '...). Although it didn't sell as good as it's opponent, the  Amiga  did, it was a milestone in computer technology as well. It was cheap, had built-in MIDI and a high-res black-and-white monitor with 70Hz and so was often seen in sound-recording studios or offices. There was even a  ST-based laptop  called ' STacy ', and a notebook ( ST-book ). Also, together with the first  ST s, the  XL-series  was relaunched as  XE-series  ( 130XE ,  800XE ,  65XE  and  XE SYSTEM ),  in similar designed cases - considered a step backwards by most people, since the 8 bit market was already dying, these machines didn't sell as well as their ancestors did. The  ST-series , however, sold well, but as mentioned earlier, couldn't rival the  Amiga 's multimedia capabilities. Additionally,  Commodore  had already released much faster machines with  68020  and  68030  CPUs. That's why  ATARI  decided to improve the  ST-design ; the  ATARI TT  was a true 32 bit machine built around a  68030  CPU (' T hirtytwo- T hirtytwo'), but with only slightly improved graphics and not fully  ST -compatible. The  ST E -series  ('ST enhanced') was more compatible and featured  4096 colors  and  PCM-sound . Both sold quite well, but due to the lack of software making use of their capabilities, didn't become as successful as the  ST-series  was.  Finally, after having launched  the first  64 bit  videogame  (the  Jaguar ) and the  FALCON 030  (aka  SPARROW /  FX-1  -  a fantastic, new ST-design based on a  68030 CPU  and  DSP ), the company was forced to give up due to financial problems...   Also worth mentioning  is that  ATARI  had, like  Commodore , developed many machines that were interesting but have never been released ( prototypes ); among them were improved versions of the VCS (e.g.  VCS 2700 ), XL-protoypes ( 1400XL ,  XLD -series) and many ST-variants (a  130ST  with only 128K RAM, a  1040STE+  with additional onboard 80286,  EST s  ('enhanced ST')  with new BLiTTER and Shifter, a  FALCON 040  etc).

clueweb09-en0011-94-17715	"         Atari 400       Announced: December 1978   Released: November 1979   Price: US $549.95   CPU: MOS 6502,1.8MHz    RAM: 8K base, 48K max   Display: 24 X 40 text   320 x 192 monochrome   160 x 96 with 128 colors   Expansion: 2 internal expansion slots   1 cartridge slot under front cover   Ports: 4 controller ports   TV video output   Storage: external floppy drive   cassette recorder   OS: Atari OS                            The Atari 400 and 800 were both announced in December 1978, though they didn't  actually start shipping until late in 1979.    Designed primarily as a computer for children, the Atari 400 has an ""advanced child-proof design featuring  pressure-sensitive, wipe-clean keyboard"". It has a single cartridge port under the front cover.                    The Atari 400 boots-up into ""Notepad"", the only built-in program. Any other programs will have to run  from cassette or cartridge - this includes BASIC, or any other programming language.   Game cartridges can be inserted into the cartridge slot in front, starting instantly with no fuss.   Many games were clones of actual video arcade hits, others were original or copies of other popular (or not)  computer games of the 80's.         Most of the Atari 400 circuitry is under a solid metal shield, to keep the radio emissions under the legal limit.   The two internal expansion slots are also under this cover, which can only be accessed by disassembling  the entire console.   Read more about the 400's big sister, the  Atari 800  for more fun and details.   Both the Atari 400 and 800 were designed by a team which included Jay Miner, who later went on to help design  the Commodore  Amiga 1000 .

() is a majority owned subsidiary of  Infogrames Entertainment SA  (IESA), encompassing its  North America n operations. Atari develops, publishes and distributes games for all major  video game console s, as well as for the  personal computer , and is currently one of the largest third-party publishers of  video games  in the  United States .  The company that currently bears the Atari name was founded in 1993 under the name  GT Interactive . GT Interactive was acquired by IESA in 1999 and renamed  Infogrames, Inc.  Infogrames acquired the Atari brand name from its purchase of  Hasbro Interactive , which in turn had acquired it from  JTS Corporation , which the original Atari had merged with in 1996. Infogrames, Inc. intermittently used the Atari name as a  brand name  for selected titles before IESA officially changed the U.S. subsidiary's name to Atari, Inc. in 2003.  The original Atari was a pioneer in  arcade game s, home  video game console s, and  personal computer s, and its dominance in those areas made it  the  major force in the  computer  entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. The brand has also been used at various times by  Atari Games , a separate company split off in 1984.  History   Since the early days of coin operated machines, Atari has been responsible for home consoles such as the  Atari 2600  (VCS); produced a series of  eight-bit computers  (Atari 400 & 800); taken part in the 16 bit computer revolution with the  Atari ST ; made the revolutionary (for its time) 64-bit  Atari Jaguar ; and released a hand held video game console, the  Atari Lynx .  The 1970s: The rise of a video game empire    In 1970  Nolan Bushnell  saw  Spacewar!  for the first time at the  University of Utah . Deciding there was commercial potential in a coin-op version, he hand-wired a custom computer capable of playing it on a black and white  television  in a single-player mode where the player shot at two orbiting  UFO s. The resulting game,  Computer Space , was released by an existing coin-op game company,  Nutting Associates .  Computer Space did not fare well commercially when it was placed in Nutting's customary market, bars. Feeling that the game was simply too complex for the average (potentially drunk) customer, Bushnell started looking for new ideas. In 1971 he saw a demonstration of the  Magnavox Odyssey , and quickly produced an arcade version,  PONG . After negotiations with Nutting to release PONG through them broke down, Bushnell and his partner Ted Dabney decided to start their own company.   They originally wanted to call the company  Syzygy , an astronomical term. However, as there already existed at least one company with that name (Bushnell stated in an official interview that it was a candle company), Bushnell wrote down several words from the game  Go , eventually choosing  Atari , a term that means that a  stone  or group of stones is in danger of being taken by one's opponent. Also, the name ""Atari"" is arguably more memorable than ""Syzygy"" in terms of spelling and pronunciation for most markets. Atari was incorporated in 1972. PONG went on to be a massive hit, only more so in  video game console  form, far better known than the Odyssey that spawned it.  In 1973, Atari secretly spawned a ""competitor"" called  Kee Games , headed by long-time partner Joe Keenan, to circumvent pinball distributors' insistence on exclusive distribution deals; both Atari and Kee could market (virtually) the same game to different distributors, with each getting an ""exclusive"" deal. Though Kee's relationship to Atari was discovered in 1974, Joe Keenan did such a good job managing the subsidiary that he was promoted to president of Atari that same year.  In 1975 Bushnell started an effort to produce a flexible video game console that was capable of playing all four of Atari's then-current games. Development took place at an offshoot engineering lab, who initially had serious difficulties trying to produce such a machine. However, in early 1976 the now-famous  MOS Technology 6502  was released, and for the first time the team had a  CPU  with both the high-performance and low-cost needed to meet their needs. The result was the  Atari 2600 , which is one of the most successful consoles in history.  Bushnell knew he had another potential hit on his hands, but bringing the machine to market would be extremely expensive. Looking for outside investors, in 1976 Bushnell sold Atari to  Warner Communications  for an estimated $28–$32 million, using part of the money to buy the Folgers Mansion. He departed from the division in 1979.  A project to design a successor to the 2600 started as soon as the system shipped. The original development team estimated the 2600 had a lifespan of about three years, and decided to build the most powerful machine they could given that time frame. By the middle of the effort's time-frame the  home computer  revolution was taking off, so the new machines were adapted with the addition of a keyboard and various inputs to produce the  Atari 800 , and its smaller cousin, the 400. Although a variety of issues made them less attractive than the  Apple II  for some users, the new machines had some level of success when they finally became available in quantity in 1980.  While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time.  The 1980s: Hurdles ahead  Although the 2600 had garnered the lion's share of the home video game market, it experienced its first stiff competition in 1980 from  Mattel's   Intellivision , which featured ads touting its superior graphics capabilities relative to the 2600. Still, the 2600 remained the industry standard-bearer, because of its market superiority, and because of Atari featuring (by far) the greatest variety of game titles available.  However, Atari ran into problems in the early 1980s. Its  home computer ,  video game console , and  arcade  divisions operated independently of one another and rarely cooperated. Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to duplicate the success of the 2600.   In 1982, Atari released disappointing versions of two highly publicized games,  Pac-Man  and  E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial , causing a pileup of unsold inventory and depressing prices. (It is rumored that in 1983, in response to a massive number of returned orders from distributors,  Atari buried millions of unsold game cartridges  (the bulk of them consisting of those same two titles, Pac-Man and E.T.) in a  New Mexico   desert   landfill .)  Also in 1982, Atari settled a court case with  Activision , a competing game developer primarily composed of disgruntled Atari ex-employees, officially opening the 2600 to third-party development. The market quickly became saturated, depressing prices further.  In December of 1982, Atari executives  Ray Kassar  and  Dennis Groth  were investigated for allegations of insider trading (later found to be false).   Larry Emmons, employee No.3, retired in 1982. He was head of research and development of the small group of talented engineers in Grass Valley, California, who had designed the 2600 and home computers.   The  Atari 5200  game console, released as a next-generation follow up to the 2600, was based on the Atari 800 computer (but was incompatible with Atari 800 game cartridges), and its sales never met the company's expectations.   Still, Atari held a formidable position in the world video game market. They were the number one console maker in every market except  Japan ; that market belonged to  Nintendo , which had released their first game console, the  Famicom  (known to the rest of the world as the  NES ) in 1983. The system took Japan by storm, and Nintendo began to look to other markets. They approached Atari and offered a licensing deal: Atari would build and sell the system, paying Nintendo a royalty. The deal was in the works, and the two companies tentatively decided to sign the agreement at the 1983 Summer  CES . Unfortunately, at that same show  Coleco  was showcasing their new  Adam computer , and the display unit was running Nintendo's  Donkey Kong . Atari CEO  Ray Kassar  was furious, as Atari owned the rights to publish Donkey Kong for computers, and he accused Nintendo of double dealing with the Donkey Kong license. Nintendo, in turn, tore into Coleco, who only owned the console rights to the game. In the coming month, Ray Kassar was forced to leave Atari, and executives involved in the Famicom deal were forced to start over again from scratch.   These problems were followed by the infamous  video game crash of 1983 , which caused losses that totaled more than $500 million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20, and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division. As for Nintendo, Atari could no longer afford the Famicom deal. Although Nintendo were ultimately forced to market the Famicom themselves (as the NES), they managed to make a major success of the system without Atari's involvement (and their profit sharing).  In July 1984, Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to  Jack Tramiel , the recently ousted founder of Atari competitor  Commodore International , under the name  Atari Corporation  for $240 million in stocks under the new company. Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name  Atari Games  and eventually selling it to  Namco  in 1985. Warner also sold the fledgling  Ataritel  to  Mitsubishi .    Under Tramiel's ownership,  Atari Corp.  used the remaining stock of game console inventory to keep the company afloat while they finished development of their 16-bit computer system, the  Atari ST . In 1985 they released their update to the 8-bit computer line, the Atari XE series, as well as the 16-bit  Atari ST  line. Then, in 1986, Atari launched two consoles designed under the Warner Atari - Atari 2600jr and the  Atari 7800  console (which saw limited release in 1984). Atari rebounded, producing a $25 million profit that year. The Atari ST line proved very successful (but mostly in Europe, not the U.S.), ultimately selling more than 4 million units. It was especially popular among musicians, as it had built in  MIDI  ports. Still, its closest competitor in the marketplace, the  Commodore Amiga , outsold it 3 to 2. Atari eventually released a line of inexpensive  IBM PC compatible s as well as an MS-DOS compatible palm computer called the Atari Portfolio.  In 1989, Atari also released the  Atari Lynx , a handheld console with color graphics, to critical acclaim. However, a shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season. As a result, the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo's  Game Boy , which had only a black and white display but was widely available. Also in 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly. Atari lost.  The 1990s: Decline  As the fortunes of Atari's ST and PC compatible computers faded, consoles and software again became the company's main focus. In 1993, Atari released its last console, the  Jaguar . After a period of initial success, it, too, failed to meet expectations. It was not nearly as powerful as  Sony Computer Entertainment's   PlayStation  or  Sega's   Saturn  and lacked the extensive third party support its Japanese competitors had easily secured for their consoles.  By 1996, a series of successful lawsuits followed by profitable investments had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank, but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari without any products to sell. In addition, Tramiel and his family wanted out. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. In July 1996, Atari merged with  JTS Inc. ,a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, to form JTS Corp. Atari's role in the new company largely became a holder for the Atari properties and minor support, consequently the name largely disappeared from the market.   Although the original Atari ceased to exist, a large amount of underground development remains for Atari's game systems and computers of the 1970s and 1980s, and many of the retro-gaming conventions (such as World Of Atari,  Classic Gaming Expo , Philly Classic, and the Midwest Gaming Classic), focus largely on Atari. There are also websites dedicated to the release of new products for the original Atari consoles and computers, such as  AtariAge .  In March 1998, JTS sold the Atari name and assets to Hasbro Interactive for $5 million—less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. This transaction primarily involved the  brand  and  intellectual property , which now fell under the Atari Interactive division of Hasbro Interactive. The brand name changed hands again in December 2000, when French software publisher  Infogrames  took over Hasbro Interactive.  In the meantime,  Atari Games  was bought out by its employees in 1986, who also founded  Tengen  to bring their arcade games in to the home. The new  Time-Warner  eventually started gaining more and more shares in the company until they eventually owned the company completely again by 1994. At that point Atari Games ceased to exist and became part of Time-Warner Interactive. By 1996, Time-Warner sold TWI to  WMS Industries, Inc. , owner of  Midway  at the time. WMS brought the properties under Midway (which it now renamed Midway Games Inc.), and re-instated the  Atari Games  name. In 1998, Midway was sold to its shareholders and spun off as a separate company. Over 1999-2000, Midway held closed door proceedings with Hasbro which ultimately led to Atari Games being renamed Midway Games West. Midway left the arcade industry in 2001, and shut down Midway Games West in 2003 - closing the chapter on what was left of the original Atari arcade division.  The 2000s: Revival and re-release of Atari classics  In October 2001,  Infogrames  announced that it was ""reinventing"" the Atari brand with the launch of three new games. On  May 7 ,  2003 , Infogrames officially reorganized its US subsidiary as a separate entity known as  Atari, Inc. . It named its European operations to Atari Europe, and kept the main holdings company as Infogrames Entertainment.     In 2002,  Jakks Pacific , a toy making company, released a  plug-and-play  video game console called the Atari 10-in-1 TV Game, believed by many to arouse interest in the concept of self-contained entertainment devices that did not require separate hardware to operate. It was battery-operated and shaped similarly to an Atari 2600 joystick, and included A/V ports. In 2004, the same company created a device called Atari Paddle Games, in the shape of one of the 2600's ""paddle"" controllers with appropriate titles included. However, as stated, neither of the games was directly released by Atari.  The same year that the Paddle Games were released, Atari released a TV game of their own which they called the  Atari Flashback  Console. The device they produced looked like a minute version of the Atari 7800 console originally released in 1984, 20 years previously. The two controllers were small as well, having a joystick and two red buttons on each side. Twenty titles were built into the system. Unlike most plug-and-plays, the Flashback was not powered by batteries, but an (included) AC adaptor instead. The Flashback did fairly well in sales; however, many Atari fans felt disappointed. Many people felt that the device itself was far too small, and the joysticks felt very dissimilar to those of the 7800. Since the games were all recreated on hardware more closely resembling the  Nintendo Entertainment System  than the 7800, some of the aspects of certain games concerning the sound, graphics, or gameplay were either changed or omitted. Overall, many enthusiasts believed that the Flashback did not capture the true Atari experience.  Because of popular demand, Atari released a new version of the Flashback console, titled  Atari Flashback 2 , in August 2005.  Also, in late October 2005, Atari released one of two collections of its classic arcade games only for the Nokia N-Gage console, titled Atari Masterpieces. Atari Masterpieces Volume I includes classic arcade games: Asteroids, Battlezone, Black Widow, Millipede, Missile Command, Red Baron, Lunar Lander and Super Breakout, and features an exclusive interview with Nolan Bushnell. Atari Masterpieces Volume II is scheduled to be released in March 2006.  On May 5th, 2006, Atari and Hasbro stopped Bioware and DLA from further development of premium modules and publishing near-completed premium modules for Neverwinter Nights. No reason was stated, but it was likely in anticipation of the upcoming sequel, Neverwinter Nights 2, which would lack features from these modules.  Atari's New Titles and Direction  Recently, Atari's top-selling titles have been the  Dragon Ball Z  games based on the popular anime license from  Toei Animation  in  Japan . These include the   Budokai  series of games for next-generation console systems and the   The Legacy of Goku  series of games for the Game Boy Advance. These games have topped the  best-seller charts  for numerous console platforms since the release of Atari's first  Dragon Ball Z  game,   The Legacy of Goku  in 2002, which was the first  Dragon Ball  game to be made by an American company,  Webfoot Technologies , and is one of the  best-selling  Game Boy Advance games of all time (#16). The best selling  Budokai  series is developed in Japan by  Dimps  and includes   Budokai ,   Budokai 2 ,   Budokai 3  and   Budokai Tenkaichi . Following the success of the Budokai and Legacy of Goku series, Atari has released numerous other Dragon Ball titles including   Supersonic Warriors ,   Super Sonic Warriors 2 ,   Sagas ,   Transformation  and   Final Bout .  Atari also released a series of games based on the smash-hit  The Matrix  movie trilogy including  Enter the Matrix  and   Path of Neo . These titles represent some of the most expensive video games ever developed.  Enter the Matrix , which was developed by  Shiny Entertainment , sold 1.38 million units for the Sony  PlayStation 2  and 1 million units for the  Nintendo GameCube , making it one of the  best selling computer and video games .  Other currently popular titles for Atari include the  RollerCoaster Tycoon  and  Driver  series.

The   Atari 5200  game console, released as a next-generation followup to the 2600, was based on the Atari 800 computer (but was incompatible with Atari 800 game cartridges), and its sales never met the company's expectations. Some time during the   1980s , it is rumored Atari buried millions of unsold E.T. game cartridges in a   New Mexico    desert    landfill .  Still, Atari held a formidable position in the world video game market. They were the number one console maker in every market except   Japan . That market belonged to   Nintendo , who had released their first game console, the   Famicom  (known to the rest of the world as the   NES ) in   1983 . The system took Japan by storm, and Nintendo began to look to other markets. They approached Atari and offered a licensing deal - Atari would build and sell the system, paying Nintendo a royalty. The deal was all but done, and the two companies decided to formally sign the agreement at the 1983 Summer CES. Unfortunately, at that same show   Coleco  was showing their new Adam computer, and the display unit was running   Donkey Kong . But Atari owned the rights to publish Donkey Kong for computers. Atari CEO  Ray Kassar  had a fit, accusing Nintendo of double dealing with the Donkey Kong license. Nintendo in turn tore into Coleco. In the coming month, Ray Kassar was forced to leave Atari, and executives involved in the Famicom deal were forced to start over again from scratch.   These problems were followed by the infamous   video game crash of 1983 , which caused losses that totaled more than $500 million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20 and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division. As for Nintendo, Atari could no longer afford the Famicom deal, and eventually Nintendo would be forced to go it alone.  In July   1984 , Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to   Jack Tramiel , the recently ousted founder of Atari competitor   Commodore International , under the name  Atari Corp.  for $240 million. Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name   Atari Games .  Under Tramiel's ownership,  Atari Corp.  abandoned the game console market to concentrate on aggressively priced home computers, releasing the 8-bit Atari XE series and the 16-bit   Atari ST  line in   1985 . Then, in   1986 , Atari re-released the Atari 2600 and released its previously cancelled Atari 7800 console.  Atari rebounded, producing a $25 million profit that year. The Atari ST line proved moderately successful, ultimately selling more than 4 million units. It was especially popular among musicians, as it had built in MIDI ports. Still, its closest competitor in the marketplace, the   Amiga , outsold it 1.5 to 1. Atari eventually released a line of inexpensive   IBM PC compatible s as well.  Atari also released Atari Lynx, a handheld console with color graphics, in   1989  to critical acclaim. However, a shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season and as a result, the Lynx lost marketshare to Nintendo's   Game Boy , which had only a black and white display but was widely available. Also in 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly. Atari lost.  As the fortunes of Atari's ST and PC compatible computers faded, consoles and software again became the company's main focus. In   1993 , Atari released its last console, the Jaguar. After a period of initial success, it, too, failed to meet expectations. Although it was more powerful than competing consoles from the likes of   Sony  and   Sega  in some ways, it was also more expensive and more difficult to program. Atari's competitors offered larger software libraries and advertised much more heavily.  By   1996 , a series of successful lawsuits followed by profitable investments had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank, but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari without any products to sell. In addition, Tramiel and his family wanted out. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. In July 1996, Atari merged with   JTS Corporation , a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, and the Atari name largely disappeared from the market.   Although the original Atari ceased to exist, a large amount of underground development remains for Atari's game systems and computers of the   1970s  and   1980s , and much of the  Classic Gaming Expo 's attention, which has existed since   1997 , focuses on Atari.  In March   1998 , JTS sold the Atari name and assets to   Hasbro Interactive  for $5 million, less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. This transaction primarily involved the   brand  and   intellectual property ; the development headquarters and design teams during this time were bought by   Midway . The brand name changed hands again in December   2000  when French software publisher   Infogrames  took over Hasbro Interactive.  In October   2001 ,   Infogrames  announced that it was ""reinventing"" the Atari brand with the launch of three new games. On   May 7 ,   2003 , Infogrames officially changed its name to  Atari, Inc.

Atari ST The Atari ST was a home/ personal computer system released by Atari in 1985.

Other theories say that ST really stood for Atari For the concept in the game of go, see Atari (go term). Atari Inc. is now the name of a French-owned (ex. Infogrames) game software company. The original company Atari was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and personal computers, and it Atari 2600 The Atari 2600 released in 1977, was the first successful video game console to use plug-in cartridges instead of having one or more games built in.

Primarily responsible for the formation of the video arcade and modern video game industries, the company was closed and its assets split in 1984 as a direct result of the  North American video game crash of 1983 .

Deciding there was commercial potential in a coin-op version, several years later he and  Ted Dabney  worked on a hand-wired custom computer capable of playing it on a black and white  television  in a single-player mode where the player shot at two orbiting  UFOs . The resulting game,  Computer Space , was released by an existing coin-op game company,  Nutting Associates .   Computer Space  did not fare well commercially when it was placed in Nutting's customary market, bars. Feeling that the game was simply too complex for the average customer, Bushnell started looking for new ideas. [ 1 ]          The original Atari upright cabinet       Bushnell and Ted Dabney left Nutting to form their own engineering firm,  Syzygy Engineering , [ 2 ]  and soon hired  Al Alcorn  as their first design engineer. Initially wanting to start Syzygy off with a driving game, Bushnell had concerns that it might be too complicated for the young Alcorn's first game. [ 1 ]  In May 1972, Nolan had seen a demonstration of the  Magnavox Odyssey , which included a tennis game. According to Alcorn, Nolan decided to have him produce an arcade version of the Odyssey's Tennis game, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]  which would go on to be named  Pong . Atari later had to pay Magnavox a licensing fee after the latter sued Atari because of this.  [ 6 ] [ 7 ]   When they went to incorporate their firm that June, they soon found that  Syzygy  (an astronomical term) already existed in California. Bushnell wrote down several words from the game  Go , eventually choosing  atari , a term that in the context of the game means a state where a  stone  or group of stones is imminently in danger of being taken by one's opponent. Atari was incorporated in the state of California on June 27th, 1972. [ 8 ]   By November 1972, the first  Pong  was completed. It consisted of a black and white television from  Walgreens , the special game hardware, and a coin mechanism from a laundromat on the side which featured a milk carton inside to catch coins. Placed in a  Sunnyvale  tavern by the name of Andy Capp's to test its viability, it took only one day to realize they had a hit:   ""Seven quarters later they were having extended volleys, and the constant pong noise was attracting the curiosity of others at the bar. Before closing, everybody in the bar had played the game. The next day people were lined up outside Andy Capp's at 10 A.M. to play Pong. Around ten o'clock that night, the game suddenly died."" [ 9 ]   When they arrived the next morning to fix the machine, they were met by a lineup of people waiting for the bar to open so they could play the game. On examination, the problem turned out to be mundane; the coin collector was filled to overflowing with quarters, and when customers tried to jam them in anyway, the mechanism shorted out.   After talks to release Pong through Nutting and several other companies broke down, Bushnell and his partner Ted Dabney decided to release Pong on their own, [ 1 ]  and Atari Inc. was established as a coin-op design and production company.          The third version of the Atari  Video Computer System  sold from 1980 to 1981       In 1973, Atari secretly spawned a ""competitor"" called  Kee Games , headed by Nolan's next door neighbor Joe Keenan, to circumvent  pinball  distributors' insistence on exclusive distribution deals; both Atari and Kee could market (virtually) the same game to different distributors, with each getting an ""exclusive"" deal. Though Kee's relationship to Atari was discovered in 1974, Joe Keenan did such a good job managing the subsidiary that he was promoted to president of Atari that same year.   In 1975, Bushnell started an effort to produce a flexible video game console that was capable of playing all four of Atari's then-current games. Development took place at an offshoot engineering lab, which initially had serious difficulties trying to produce such a machine. However, in early 1976 the now-famous  MOS Technology 6502  was released, and for the first time the team had a  CPU  with both the high-performance and low-cost needed to meet their needs. The result was the  Atari 2600 , one of the most successful consoles in history.     [ edit ]   As a subsidiary of Warner Communications   Bushnell knew he had another potential hit on his hands, but bringing the machine to market would be extremely expensive. In 1976 Bushnell sold Atari to  Warner Communications  for an estimated $28 - $32 million, using part of the money to buy the Folgers Mansion. He departed from the division in 1979.          The  Atari 400  was released in 1979       A project to design a successor to the 2600 started as soon as the system shipped. The original development team estimated the 2600 had a lifespan of about three years, and decided to build the most powerful machine they could given that time frame. By the middle of the effort's time-frame the  home computer  revolution was taking off, so the new machines were adapted with the addition of a keyboard and various inputs to produce the  Atari 800 , and its smaller cousin, the 400. Although a variety of issues made them less attractive than the  Apple II  for some users, the new machines had some level of success when they finally became available in quantity in 1980.   While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time.   Although the 2600 had garnered the lion's share of the home video game market, it experienced its first stiff competition in 1980 from  Mattel's   Intellivision , which featured ads touting its superior graphics capabilities relative to the 2600. Still, the 2600 remained the industry standard-bearer, because of its market superiority, and because of Atari featuring (by far) the greatest variety of game titles available.   However, Atari ran into problems in the early 1980s. Its  home computer ,  video game console , and  arcade  divisions operated independently of one another and rarely cooperated. Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to duplicate the success of the 2600.     In 1982, Atari released disappointing versions of two highly publicized games,  Pac-Man  and  E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial , causing a pileup of unsold inventory and depressing prices. (In 1983, in response to a massive number of returned orders from distributors,  Atari buried millions of unsold game cartridges  (the bulk of them consisting of those same two titles,  Pac-Man  and  E.T. ) in a  New Mexico   desert   landfill .)   In December 1982, Atari executives  Ray Kassar  and  Dennis Groth  were investigated for allegations of insider trading (later found to be false).   Larry Emmons, employee No.3, retired in 1982. He was head of research and development of the small group of talented engineers in Grass Valley, California, who had designed the 2600 and home computers.   The  Atari 5200  game console, released as a next-generation follow up to the 2600, was based on the Atari 800 computer (but was incompatible with Atari 800 game cartridges), and its sales never met the company's expectations.     These problems were followed by the infamous  video game crash of 1983 , which caused losses that totaled more than $500 million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20, and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division.   Still, Atari held a formidable position in the world video game market, and was the number one console maker in every market except  Japan . A Japanese video game company by the name of  Nintendo  was going to be releasing their first programmable video game console, the  Famicom  (later known to the rest of the world as the  NES ), in 1983. Looking to also sell the console in international markets, a partnership with Atari seemed a good match and Nintendo approached Atari to offer a licensing deal whereby Atari would build and sell the system, paying Nintendo a royalty. The deal was in the works throughout 1983, [ 10 ]  and the two companies tentatively decided to sign the agreement at the June, 1983  CES . Unfortunately,  Coleco  was showcasing their new  Adam computer , and the display unit was running Nintendo's  Donkey Kong . Atari CEO  Ray Kassar  was furious, as Atari owned the rights to publish Donkey Kong for computers, and he accused Nintendo of double dealing with the Donkey Kong license. Nintendo, in turn, tore into Coleco, who only owned the console rights to the game.  [2]  Coleco had legal grounds to challenge the claim though since Atari had only purchased the floppy disk rights to the game, while the Adam version was cartridge-based. [ 11 ]  In the coming month, Ray Kassar was forced to leave Atari, and executives involved in the Famicom deal were forced to start over again from scratch and the deal eventually languished. With Atari's further financial problems and the Famicom's runaway Japanese success after its July 16th, 1983 release date, Nintendo decided to go at it alone.     [ edit ]   Splitting of properties   Financial problems continued to grow and Kassar's replacement,  James J. Morgan , had less than a year to try and tackle his predecessor's problems before he too was gone. In July 1984, Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to  Jack Tramiel , the recently ousted founder of Atari competitor  Commodore International , under the name  Atari Corporation  for $240 million in stocks under the new company. Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name  Atari Games  and eventually selling it to  Namco  in 1985. Warner also sold the fledgling  Ataritel  to  Mitsubishi .

By  Miro Kropacek  on 2009-01-07 Hi people,        so here we are again. Jookie did his best to give you another cool piece of hardware for our beloved Atari beasts and as always, I'm that crazy guy who is up to organize some (big quotes here) business around it ;-)        You can take a look at Jookie's website (http://joo.kie.sk/ultrasatan) for specs, in short:        - ACSI to SD/SDHC/MMC interface solution    - much faster than original SatanDisk (nearly in the limit of ACSI itself!)    - upgradable firmware!    - 2 slots (yeah, behaving like two hard disks!)    - 100% functional cooperation with other ACSI(-to-SCSI) devices: Atari hard disks, Link 9x, ... everything can work all together!    - hot swap functionality! No more reset / power off when changing card! Just like diskette swapping!    - battery backed up realtime clock    - behaves like standard hard disk device    - and the best one: if you don't want to pay, you can build it by yourself -- sources, blueprints etc -- everything is free!        Well, you know the deal. Go to the website (http://mikro.umpc.sk/us_order until I register ultrasatan.atari.org), register, fill out your preliminary interest and wait for payment phase. In case of any problems or questions ask me or Jookie (but we prefer the first option since Jookie don't like to be bothered with all this order 'crap' :)        And the last note -- people, please, behave like normal human beings in our space/time continuum ;-) When we say preorder phase is for two months and payments phase is for another two months, we really mean it. Notice these dates in your mobile phone, calendar, wall, desktop, anywhere but please, don't ask me in October if you still can order our cool hardware... in this way I'd like to ask you for favor -- tell about this HW all your Atari friends, ask them stupid questions like ""did you hear about US project?"" and so on.        You can't imagine how many guys are mailing me MONTHS after manufacturing about our HW projects. It's very unlikely we will made another batch, so take your only chance. I think we have proven we're not some imaginary money rippers, our HW is real and working, people are happy, be happy as well ;-)        OK, that's it, keep fingers crossed!

The web site states that it is now \""supporting a built-in 68000/68030 debugger,\"" and has \""improved compatibility with Windows Vista and recent multi-core 64-bit processors.\""        The code has been reworked to remove Windows dependencies for improved compatibility and portability. The main Gemulator page has not been thoroughly updated, so you really need to read the December 1st No Execute! blog for build instructions if you want to compile your own. Since Darek also tends to mention Gemulator development in passing in his blog, you would need to look at all the blog entries for a complete look at what Darek has been working on.        Gemulator 9 home page:        http://www.emulators.com/gemul8r.htm        December 1, 2008 No Execute! blog entry:        http://www.emulators.com/docs/nx27_nehalem.htm        At the end of this blog entry, Darek announces that he is going to work for Intel.        Best of luck, Darek!   Category: Emulators (WinSTon, Handy ...)   New C99 compiler toolchain available for Atari ! By  Miro Kropacek  on 2009-01-01 Hi everybody,        I'm more than happy to announce the end of our effort to port vbcc/vasm/vlink tools to the TOS platform. Thanks to dedicated work of Frank Wille we've got:        - modern & superb assembler with nearly all devpac directives, i.e. you can finally use your fave assembler under any modern multitasking OS (i.e. FreeMiNT)        - linker with many input and output formats        - fully compliant ANSI C99 compiler that produces hell of optimized code        The whole toolchain was heavily tested on one big project, i.e. we killed quite a many bugs so you should get very well tested product.        As suggested, this toolchain is aimed to be replacement for bloated gcc/gas/ld toolchain which is quite unusable on anything but aranym/ct60. vbcc is lightweight package that runs fine on 4 MB machines, even without FreeMiNT (i.e. under plain TOS!)         Primarily, it's focused to run under FreeMiNT, so I post here little tutorial for the first hello world, in case you're interested in making setup for commandline compiler/assebler under single TOS, feel free to contact me. So, the easiest way to compile ""Hello World"" under FreeMiNT:        1. go to the website (http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vbcc)    2. download vbcc_bin_mint.tar.gz and vbcc_target_m68k-atarimint.zip    3. directories ""bin"" and ""config"" from vbcc_bin_mint.tar.gz copy into /usr/local/vbcc    4. create environment variable called ""VBCC"" with the value of ""/usr/local/vbcc""    5. directory ""targets"" from vbcc_target_m68k-atarimint.zip copy into /usr/local/vbcc    6. tweak access rights for /usr/local/vbcc/targets/m68k-atarimint/include/* and /usr/local/vbcc/targets/m68k-atarimint/lib/* with ""chmod +r+w""        type ""vc -o hello hello.c"" and you should get Atari ST compatible binary! Please refer to the manual of vasm/vbcc/vlink for advanced usage. You can contact me (see my website) for Atari specific things or Frank in case you fall into some trouble.        What? Did I hear you don't need new C compiler since you're happy with your gcc/g++ but still like the idea of having new assembler? Well, no problem! vasm is able to produce fully compliant a.out mint object files, so you can link vasm output with gcc, yeah! Beat this with devpac!        What again? Maybe you would use the vbcc but the gcc offers cross compilation possibility? Well, vbcc as well! You can produce amiga, elf, atari etc binaries on amiga, linux, freemint, windows etc based machines! No complicated configuration, just run ""make TARGET=xxx"" on any machine you want!        Hope you'll enjoy it, I was looking for some decent devpac replacement for years and now I got it!

Well, I grew up with a number of 8-bit computer systems, and the one that I liked the most was the Atari 800. The hardware design seemed the most versatile, and furthermore, it was the hardware predecessor to the Amiga, another one of my favorite systems. One day I got struck with a particularly bad case of nostalgia for it, without access to my real Atari 800. Normally I would have just launched Atari800Win, but for some reason I wanted to write my own emulator instead, since I\'d never done a real one before, and this eventually was the result. Those of you who have followed VirtualDub\'s evolution know I like to do everything myself and in my own way. During one phase of its development, I was told: \""You have the worst case of feature creep I\'ve ever seen.\""        Indeed.        Altirra is not the most polished or complete Atari 800/800XL/130XE emulator by far, but it does run quite a lot of software. The main game I wanted to get running was The Last Starfighter, a.k.a. Star Raiders II, which has cool music and some pretty good graphics -- and turned out to be rather complicated to emulate, due to a bankswitched ROM, a complex display list, and lots of display list interrupts. I have an interest in old computer hardware, and I like to find out how hardware actually works instead of just what it does or what it was supposed to be used for. When writing Altirra, I tried to understand how the original hardware was constructed, and craft the emulator in the same fashion. As a result, it\'s pretty close to cycle exact and supports most of the features of the hardware. It isn\'t quite up to the level of Atari800Win, which I consider the gold standard, but most of the demos and games I\'ve thrown at it work. It even emulates a few things that A8W doesn\'t, such as the SIO disk transfer beeping that I remember a lot from my childhood.        Now, the reason why I was asked to release this emulator? Definitely not for the UI, which sucks. The reason is protected disk support: Altirra can boot from APE (.pro) and VAPI (.atx) disk images, which preserve the original copy protection on software. It even supports SIO (serial input/output) call acceleration and burst I/O with protected disks, which means it can boot them very quickly. At the time, neither format was documented and the patched Atari800Win version with VAPI support could not do accelerated reads, so had I released this earlier, it would have been a first; I believe the VAPI format documentation has since been released, so I guess it\'s a bit late. Still, it was interesting to see what had been done to inhibit copying, such as phantom sectors, CRC errors, and missing sectors, and to see the unmodified games boot. At one point I thought it would be cool to hook up Altirra\'s disk emulator to a serial port and an SIO2PC cable to see if the emulation was good enough to boot a real Atari, but I never got around to it.        You might laugh when I say that I wrote Altirra for educational purposes, but I swear it\'s true. I learned more about the Atari than I ever thought I would, particularly all of the undocumented hardware quirks. Among the goofball issues I had to debug were:    Getting DOS 2.0S to boot with a custom SIO implementation (it replaces serial interrupt vectors and still calls through SIOV)    A program that read from an unused hardware address and then wrote that value to another port to clear interrupts    A game that set the display list interrupt flag on a \""wait for vertical blank\"" byte (which causes the DLI to fire every scanline until VBLANK)    A demo that changed the DLI vector in HBLANK without disabling interrupts and used RTS instead of RTI to exit the handler, leading to crazy control flow    A demo that alternated the vertical scroll register between two illegal values to get a low-overhead, quarter-resolution 9-color display    A demo that displayed eight player sprites on a scanline by doing five mid-scanline register writes with exact cycle timing        I have to say, though, that although the demos were an absolute pain to get working, the things that some of the folks in Europe did in the later years on the Atari were utterly mindblowing, like real-time bump mapping, 3D texture mapping, and digital audio. On a 1.79MHz 6502.        To get the information I needed to write the emulator, I spent a lot of time reading the Atari hardware manual and poring over a gate-level chip schematic of POKEY that had been released to the public by the Atari Historical Society. I also ended up disassembling the Atari 810 disk drive control ROM at one point, because I needed to know the exact rate at which it bit-banged out data over the SIO bus and what head stepping parameters it fed to the floppy drive controller, and analyzing the schematics of the Atari 410 tape drive to replicate how it read tapes (it\'s two bandpass filters and a comparator glued onto the SIO bus).        It\'s doubtful that I\'ll work much more on Altirra, especially considering that I haven\'t really worked on it for months. One of the last things I had been doing was trying to enhance the source-level debugger and cassette support, because I had the idea that it would be possible to write a Guitar Hero or Rock Band clone on the Atari using the tape drive, since it supports an audio track... but of course, that never went far. Working on something like this, you realize quickly that, no, those weren\'t really the good old days... not when load times were measured in minutes and writing anything really cool meant debugging some really hairy 6502 assembly language. Heck, Altirra essentially amounts to the equivalent of a hardware in-circuit emulator (ICE), and it\'s still a pain to track down bugs in a machine language program. So, basically, I\'m throwing it out there just to see if anyone else has the same curiosities as me and finds it interesting. Source is, of course, available under the GPL, and if you\'ve looked at the VirtualDub source, much of it will look familiar as I used the same base libraries. Enjoy!

By  Miro Kropacek  on 2008-10-19 By browsing the net I found the news article about Calamus 1.0 (first released) version being available for free -- for everyone who didn\'t know here\'s the link for download:    http://www.calamus.net/news/2008/080701_1.php    it\'s because of celebration of 17th year of invers software.    It seems they still develop Calamus for Atari, there\'s available version of 2008 release for TOS compatible platform! And you can try Lite version for Atari, too, what is quite interesting for year 2008 :)    From the pessimistic point of view, it\'s maybe because the whole Calamus is still executed as Atari binary under built-in emulator and they don\'t have man-power to rewrite it under any modern framework...

Part of these bookmarks persist since the creation of the WEB site, back in 1996.        The interest with these numerous bookmarks, there\'s more than 600, is to constitute an ATARI uptodate and dedicated search engine of the online scene. It is a service provided by Google Co-op. The base of this engine is a collection composed from time to time. It has now become quite consistent.        This is a WEB 2.0 experience. *ATARI Search Engine* can possibly be integrated by webmasters adding the HTML code.        Have a good ATARI WEB Surfing =) Link:  http://eureka.atari.org/atari.html   Category: 16/32 (ST, STE, Falcon ...)                                     Copyright © 1997-2008 Atari.Org    Atari is registered trademark of  Infogrames           "

It is currently owned by Atari Interactive, a wholly owned subsidiary of the French publisher  Infogrames Entertainment SA  (IESA). [ 1 ]   The original  Atari Inc.  was founded in 1972 by  Nolan Bushnell  and  Ted Dabney . It was a pioneer in  arcade games , home  video game consoles , and  home computers . The company's products, such as  Pong  and the  Atari 2600 , helped define the  computer  entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid 1980s.   In 1984, the original Atari Inc. was split, and the arcade division was turned into  Atari Games Inc. . [ 2 ] Atari Games received the rights to use the logo and brand name with appended text ""Games"" on arcade games, as well as rights to the original 1972 - 1984 arcade hardware properties. The Atari Consumer Electronics Division properties were in turn sold to  Jack Tramiel's  Tramel Technology Ltd., which then renamed itself to  Atari Corporation . [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  In 1996, Atari Corporation reverse merged with disk drive manufacturer  JT Storage  (JTS), [ 5 ]  becoming a division within the company.   Atari Interactive started as a subsidiary of  Hasbro Interactive [ 6 ] , after Hasbro Interactive acquired all Atari Corporation related properties from JTS in 1998. [ 7 ] IESA in turn acquired Hasbro Interactive in 2001, and proceeded to rename it to  Infogrames Interactive .  [ 8 ]  In 2003, IESA then changed the company name entirely to Atari Interactive. [ 1 ]   The company that currently bears the name  Atari Inc.  was founded in 1993 under the name  GT Interactive . IESA acquired a 62% controlling interest in GT Interactive in 1999, and proceeded to rename it  Infogrames, Inc. [ 9 ]  After IESA's acquirement of Hasbro Interactive and its related Atari properties in 2001, Infogrames, Inc. intermittently published Atari branded titles for Infogrames Interactive. In 2003, Infogrames Inc. licensed the Atari name and logo from Atari Interactive and changed its name to Atari Inc. [ 10 ] .

(1972-1984)       Main article:  Atari, Inc       In 1971,  Nolan Bushnell  and Ted Dabney founded an engineering firm,  Syzygy Engineering , [ 12 ]  that designed and built the first arcade video game - Computer Space for Nutting Associates. On June 27, 1972 Atari, Inc. was incorporated and soon hired  Al Alcorn  as their first design engineer. Bushnell decided to have Alcorn produce as a test of his abilities, an arcade version of the  Magnavox Odyssey 's Tennis game, [ 13 ]  which would be named  Pong . While Bushnell incorporate Atari in June of 1972, Syzygy Company was never formally incorporated. Before Atari's official incorporation, Bushnell wrote down several words from the game  Go , eventually choosing  atari , a term which in the context of the game means a state where a  stone  or group of stones is imminently in danger of being taken by one's opponent. In Japanese,  atari  is the nominalized form of  ataru  (verb), meaning ""to hit the target"" or ""to receive something fortuitously"". The word 'atari' is used in Japanese when a prediction comes true or when someone wins a lottery. The choice of Atari as a brand name was arguably better than Syzygy for most markets in terms of spelling, pronunciation and potential name recognition. Atari was incorporated in the state of California on June 27th, 1972. [ 14 ]          The third version of the Atari  Video Computer System  sold from 1980 to 1981       In 1973, Atari secretly spawned a ""competitor"" called  Kee Games , headed by Nolan's next door neighbor Joe Keenan, to circumvent  pinball  distributors' insistence on exclusive distribution deals; both Atari and Kee could market (virtually) the same game to different distributors, with each getting an ""exclusive"" deal. Though Kee's relationship to Atari was discovered in 1974, Joe Keenan did such a good job managing the subsidiary that he was promoted to president of Atari that same year.   In 1976, Bushnell, through a Grass Valley, CA. engineering firm - Cyan Engineering, started an effort to produce a flexible video game console that was capable of playing all four of Atari's then-current games. The result was the  Atari 2600 , one of the most successful consoles in history, sometimes called VCS for Video Computer System. Authors on the history of videogames have consistently presented the possibility the 2600 was named after the frequency  2600 hertz  used by a blue box to gain control of telephone networks, or "" 2600: The Hacker Quarterly ,"" which began as a magazine for telephone  phreaking . Bushnell knew he had another potential hit on his hands, but bringing the machine to market would be extremely expensive. Looking for outside investors, in 1976 Bushnell sold Atari to  Warner Communications  for an estimated $28 - $32 million, using part of the money to buy the  Folgers  Mansion. He departed from the division in 1979.   A project to design a successor to the 2600 started as soon as the system shipped. The original development team estimated the 2600 had a lifespan of about three years, and decided to build the most powerful machine they could, given that time frame. Midway into the effort's time-frame, the  home computer  revolution was taking off, so the new machines were adapted, with the addition of a keyboard and various inputs, to produce the  Atari 800 , and its smaller cousin, the 400. Although a variety of issues made them less attractive than the  Apple II  for some users, the new machines had some success when they finally became available in quantity in 1980. In 1982, the  Atari 5200  was released, based heavily on the 400 and 800 models, but without a keyboard.   Under Warner, Atari Inc. achieved its greatest success, selling millions of 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time. However, Atari Inc. ran into problems in the early 1980s. Its  home computer ,  video game console , and  arcade  divisions operated independently of one another and rarely cooperated. Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to duplicate the success of the 2600.   These problems were followed by the infamous  video game crash of 1983 , with losses that totaled more than $500 million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20, and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division. In 1983, Ray Kassar was forced to leave Atari, and executives involved in the  Famicom  deal were forced to start over again, and the deal eventually died. With Atari's further financial problems and the Famicom's runaway success in Japan after its July 16th, 1983 release date,  Nintendo  decided to go it alone.   Financial problems continued to mount and Ray's successor,  James J. Morgan , had less than a year in which to tackle his predecessor's problems before he, too, left. In July 1984, Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to  Jack Tramiel  for $240 million in stocks  [ 15 ]  who then used it to create a new company under the name  Atari Corporation . Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name  Atari Games , but sold it to  Namco  in 1985. Warner also sold the fledgling  Ataritel  to  Mitsubishi .     [ edit ]   Atari Corporation (1984 - 1996)       Main article:  Atari Corporation              Atari ST       Under Tramiel's ownership,  Atari Corp.  used the remaining stock of game console inventory to keep the company afloat while they finished development on a 16-bit computer system, the  Atari ST . In April of 1985, they released the first update to the 8-bit computer line - the Atari 65XE, the  Atari XE  series. In June of 1985 saw the release of the Atari 130XE and Atari User Group's received early sneak-preview samples of the new Atari 520ST's and major retailer shipments hit store shelves in September of 1985 of Atari's new 16-bit  Atari ST  computers. In 1986, Atari launched two consoles designed under Warner - the Atari 2600jr and the  Atari 7800  console (which saw limited release in 1984). Atari rebounded, making $25 million profit that year. In 1989, Atari released the  Atari Lynx , a handheld console with color graphics, to much fanfare. A shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season and the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo's  Game Boy , which only had a black and white display, but was available. Tramiel emphasized computers over game consoles. At the time Atari like HP personal computers had their own operating systems which fell victim to Microsoft's success. But, gaming revived and Tramiel missed the boat. Also in 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly. [ 16 ]  Atari eventually lost the case when it was rejected by a  US district court  in 1992. [ 17 ]   In 1993, Atari positioned its  Jaguar  as the only 64-bit interactive media entertainment system available, and sold around 200,000 units (at $250 each) in its first year on the market.   By 1996, a series of successful lawsuits [ 18 ]  had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank, but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari without a product to sell. Tramiel and his family also wanted out of the business. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. In July 1996, Atari merged with  JTS Inc. , a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, to form JTS Corp. [ 19 ]  Atari's role in the new company largely became that of holder for the Atari properties and minor support, and consequently the name largely disappeared from the market.     [ edit ]   As a division of Hasbro (1998-2001)       Main article:  Atari Interactive       In March 1998, JTS sold the Atari name and assets to Hasbro Interactive for $5 millionless than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. This transaction primarily involved the  brand  and  intellectual property , which now fell under the Atari Interactive division of Hasbro Interactive. The brand name changed hands again in December 2000 when French software publisher  Infogrames  took over  Hasbro Interactive .     [ edit ]   Atari Inc., a division of Infogrames (2001 to present)       Main article:  Atari, Inc (Infogrames)       In October 2001  Infogrames  announced that it was ""reinventing"" the Atari brand with the launch of three new games. On May 7, 2003,  Infogrames  had its majority-owned, but discrete US subsidiary Infogrames NA officially renamed  Atari, Inc. , renamed its European operations to Atari Europe but kept the original name of the main company  Infogrames Entertainment . The original Atari holdings division purchased from Hasbro,  Atari Interactive , was also made a separate corporate entity.   On March 6, 2008, Infogrames made an offer to Atari Inc. to buy out all remaining public shares for a value of $1.68 per share, or $11 million total. The offer would make Infogrames sole owner of Atari Inc., thus making it a privately held company. [ 20 ]   On April 30, 2008, Atari Inc. announced its intentions to accept Infogrames' buyout offer and to merge with Infogrames. [ 21 ]   On October 11, 2008, Infogrames completed its acquisition of Atari Inc., making it a wholly owned subsidiary. [ 11 ]   On December 9, 2008, Atari announced that it had acquired  Cryptic Studios , a  MMORPG  developer.

It is currently owned by Atari Interactive, a wholly owned subsidiary of the French publisher  Infogrames Entertainment SA  (IESA). [ 1 ]   The original  Atari Inc.  was founded in 1972 by  Nolan Bushnell  and  Ted Dabney . It was a pioneer in  arcade games , home  video game consoles , and  home computers . The company's products, such as  Pong  and the  Atari 2600 , helped define the  computer  entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid 1980s.   In 1984, the original Atari Inc. was split, and the arcade division was turned into  Atari Games Inc. . [ 2 ] Atari Games received the rights to use the logo and brand name with appended text ""Games"" on arcade games, as well as rights to the original 1972 - 1984 arcade hardware properties. The Atari Consumer Electronics Division properties were in turn sold to  Jack Tramiel's  Tramel Technology Ltd., which then renamed itself to  Atari Corporation . [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  In 1996, Atari Corporation reverse merged with disk drive manufacturer  JT Storage  (JTS), [ 5 ]  becoming a division within the company.   Atari Interactive started as a subsidiary of  Hasbro Interactive [ 6 ] , after Hasbro Interactive acquired all Atari Corporation related properties from JTS in 1998. [ 7 ] IESA in turn acquired Hasbro Interactive in 2001, and proceeded to rename it to  Infogrames Interactive .  [ 8 ]  In 2003, IESA then changed the company name entirely to Atari Interactive. [ 1 ]   The company that currently bears the name  Atari Inc.  was founded in 1993 under the name  GT Interactive . IESA acquired a 62% controlling interest in GT Interactive in 1999, and proceeded to rename it  Infogrames, Inc. [ 9 ]  After IESA's acquirement of Hasbro Interactive and its related Atari properties in 2001, Infogrames, Inc. intermittently published Atari branded titles for Infogrames Interactive. In 2003, Infogrames Inc. licensed the Atari name and logo from Atari Interactive and changed its name to Atari Inc. [ 10 ] . On October 11th, 2008, Infogrames completed its acquisition of Atari, Inc., making it a wholly owned subsidiary.  [ 11 ]           Contents       1   History     1.1   Atari Inc.

[ edit ]   Atari Corporation (19841996)   Main article:  Atari Corporation          Atari ST       Under Tramiel's ownership,  Atari Corp.  used the remaining stock of game console inventory to keep the company afloat while they finished development on a 16-bit computer system, the  Atari ST . In April of 1985, they released the first update to the 8-bit computer line - the Atari 65XE, the  Atari XE  series. In June of 1985 saw the release of the Atari 130XE and Atari User Group's received early sneak-preview samples of the new Atari 520ST's and major retailer shipments hit store shelves in September of 1985 of Atari's new 16-bit  Atari ST  computers. In 1986, Atari launched two consoles designed under Warner - the Atari 2600jr and the  Atari 7800  console (which saw limited release in 1984). Atari rebounded, making $25 million profit that year. In 1989, Atari released the  Atari Lynx , a handheld console with color graphics, to much fanfare. A shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season and the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo's  Game Boy , which only had a black and white display, but was available. Tramiel emphasized computers over game consoles. At the time Atari like HP personal computers had their own operating systems which fell victim to Microsoft's success. But, gaming revived and Tramiel missed the boat. Also in 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly. [ 16 ]  Atari eventually lost the case when it was rejected by a  US district court  in 1992. [ 17 ]   In 1993, Atari positioned its  Jaguar  as the only 64-bit interactive media entertainment system available, and sold around 200,000 units (at $250 each) in its first year on the market.   By 1996, a series of successful lawsuits [ 18 ]  had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank, but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari without a product to sell. Tramiel and his family also wanted out of the business. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. In July 1996, Atari merged with  JTS Inc. , a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, to form JTS Corp. [ 19 ]  Atari's role in the new company largely became that of holder for the Atari properties and minor support, and consequently the name largely disappeared from the market.     [ edit ]   As a division of Hasbro (19982001)   Main article:  Atari Interactive   In March 1998, JTS sold the Atari name and assets to Hasbro Interactive for $5 millionless than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. This transaction primarily involved the  brand  and  intellectual property , which now fell under the Atari Interactive division of Hasbro Interactive. The brand name changed hands again in December 2000 when French software publisher  Infogrames  took over  Hasbro Interactive .     [ edit ]   Atari Inc., a division of Infogrames (2001 to present)   Main article:  Atari, Inc (Infogrames)   In October 2001  Infogrames  announced that it was ""reinventing"" the Atari brand with the launch of three new games. On May 7, 2003,  Infogrames  had its majority-owned, but discrete US subsidiary Infogrames NA officially renamed  Atari, Inc. , renamed its European operations to Atari Europe but kept the original name of the main company  Infogrames Entertainment . The original Atari holdings division purchased from Hasbro,  Atari Interactive , was also made a separate corporate entity.   On March 6, 2008, Infogrames made an offer to Atari Inc. to buy out all remaining public shares for a value of $1.68 per share, or $11 million total. The offer would make Infogrames sole owner of Atari Inc., thus making it a privately held company. [ 20 ]   On April 30, 2008, Atari Inc. announced its intentions to accept Infogrames' buyout offer and to merge with Infogrames. [ 21 ]   On October 11, 2008, Infogrames completed its acquisition of Atari Inc., making it a wholly owned subsidiary. [ 11 ]   On December 9, 2008, Atari announced that it had acquired  Cryptic Studios , a  MMORPG  developer.

Atari Corporation  was a manufacturer of computers and video game consoles from 1984 to 1996. Atari Corp. was founded in July 1984, Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to  Jack Tramiel , the then recently ousted founder of Atari competitor Commodore International, under the name Atari Corporation for $240 million in stocks under the new company.

In 1985, they released their update to the 8-bit computer line, the Atari XE series, as well as the 16-bit  Atari ST  line. Then, in 1986, Atari Corp. launched two consoles designed under the Warner Atari - Atari 2600jr and the  Atari 7800  console (which saw limited release in 1984). Atari Corp. rebounded, producing a $25 million profit that year. The Atari ST line proved very successful (but mostly in Europe, not the U.S.), ultimately selling more than 4 million units. It was especially popular among musicians, as it had built in  MIDI  ports. Still, its closest competitor in the marketplace, the  Commodore Amiga , outsold it 3 to 2. Atari eventually released a line of inexpensive  IBM PC compatibles  as well as an MS-DOS compatible palm computer called the Atari Portfolio.   In 1989, Atari Corp. also released the  Atari Lynx , a handheld console with color graphics, to critical acclaim. However, a shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season. As a result, the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo's  Game Boy , which had only a black and white display but was widely available. Also in 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly. Atari lost.   As the fortunes of Atari Corporation's ST and PC compatible computers faded, consoles and software again became the company's main focus. In 1993, Atari Corp. released its last console, the  Atari Jaguar . After a period of initial success, it, too, failed to meet expectations. It was not nearly as powerful as  Sony Computer Entertainment's   PlayStation  or  Sega's   Saturn  and lacked the extensive third party support its Japanese competitors had easily secured for their consoles.     [ edit ]   Atari Corp.'s reverse merger with JT Storage Inc.   By 1996, a series of successful lawsuits followed by profitable investments had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank, but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari without any products to sell. In addition, Tramiel and his family wanted out. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. In July 1996, Atari merged with  JTS Inc. ,a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, to form JTS Corp. [ 1 ]  Atari's role in the new company largely became a holder for the Atari properties and minor support, consequently the name largely disappeared from the market.   In March 1998, JTS sold the Atari name and assets to Hasbro Interactive for $5 millionless than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier.

The company adopted the classic Atari moniker in 2003 with hopes of boosting brand recognition and reviving slumping sales. Atari publishes titles such as ""Act of War, Dragonball Z, Neverwinter Nights, Godzilla, Rollercoaster Tycoon,"" and Test Drive.

Atari became famous for ""Pong,"" a video game that simulated Ping-Pong on TV.  In 1976, Atari was sold to Warner Communications which came out with a game computer dubbed the Atari Video Computer System.  In 1978, the Atari 400 and 800 home computers were introduced and became successful.  Later came the 600XL and 1200XL models. In 1984, Atari was sold to Jack Tramiel and investors, which introduced the ST personal computer line in 1985 to compete with the Macintosh.  The STs were advanced machines that were available into the 1990s, but although popular, they received limited application support.  Atari made attempts at offering IBM-compatible PCs, but failed in that arena.  In late 1992, Atari introduced the Falcon multimedia computer, but soon shut down its R&D.  At the end of 1993, it introduced the Jaguar video game, but sales were not sufficient to continue.  In 1996, Atari merged with JTS Corporation, a San Jose-based manufacturer of hard disks.  In 1998, Hasbro acquired the Atari name and intellectual property rights from JTS. Atari 400 Sporting a whopping 16K of RAM and 8K of ROM, the Atari 400 was used mostly for games, which were contained in ROM cartridges that plugged into the unit.  Atari computers helped spearhead the personal computer revolution in the early 1980s.

Incorporated:  1972 NAIC:  511210 Software Publishers      Before its merger with disk drive maker JTS Corporation in 1996, the Atari Corporation was a prominent manufacturer of video games and home computers that pioneered the industry of video entertainment. Its history was  beset  by a series of successes and ultimately defeats: it made money from arcade games, then nearly went  bankrupt ; it took on new life and astronomical profits in the early 1980s, only to see its industry crash once again, leaving the company to rebuild slowly under different management and then finally  succumb  to the rise of the PC-based CD-ROM as the preferred medium for computer games. The Atari name, however, was acquired by Infogrames Entertainment in 2001, and that company proceeded to rechristen its U.S. subsidiary Atari Inc. Atari was founded by Nolan Bushnell in 1972. Bushnell had first become interested in computer games as an engineering student at the University of Utah. After graduation, he worked as a researcher in a Silicon Valley firm, and there he developed his first electronic game, called Computer Space, in 1971. Although this game, like all the other  fledgling  products before it, was not a commercial success, Bushnell used $500 to start a company with a friend anyway, naming it Atari, a term from the Japanese game of ""go"" used to politely alert opponents that they are about to be  overrun . Bushnell's second game was a revolutionary development, in that it was far simpler than other games had been. Called ""Pong,"" it was an electronic version of  ping pong , played on a screen with a vertical line down the middle and two sliding paddles that batted a  blip  back and forth. The company first marketed a coin-operated version of this game in 1972 for use in arcades. Since the game could be played by two people in direct competition with each other, Pong was a dramatic departure from the solitary skills of  pinball , and it changed the nature of arcade games. Unfortunately, Atari was unable to  reap  the rewards of this advance, since dozens of competitors quickly duplicated the game and grabbed a large portion of the market. Within two years of Pong's introduction, its inventors had sold only 10 percent of the machines in existence. Atari channeled the profits it had made into ventures that turned out to be  shortsighted  and  nonproductive . The company wasted half a million dollars on an abortive attempt to market its products in Japan. In addition, it sunk resources into an attempt to open game arcades in Hawaii. Although Atari introduced a series of new games to follow Pong, formulated in the company's informal,  unstructured  atmosphere, none caught on as much as its first offering. Video games for use in the home had first been introduced by Magnavox in 1972, and Atari decided that a logical next step would be to introduce a home version of Pong, to be played on a television screen. Short of funds, the company worked out an arrangement with Sears, Roebuck & Company for the retailer to buy all 100,000 of the devices that Atari manufactured, as well as helping out with funding for Atari's inventories, to guarantee delivery. In the fall of 1975, the home version of Pong was introduced. Clearly, Atari needed further funds to expand. Rather than sell stock to the public, the company decided to look for a buyer. In 1976, after four months of legal wrangling complicated by a lawsuit filed against Bushnell by his first wife, Atari was sold to Warner Communications Inc. for $28 million. Of this, Pong's inventor collected about $15 million. By the next year, however, Atari's problems had moved beyond funding. The company's products at the time could be used to play only one game, and consumers were beginning to feel that the novelty of playing that one game had worn off. In late 1977 Atari's researchers introduced the Video Computer System, or VCS 2600, which used a  semiconductor  chip in a programmable device. With this product, the customer gained versatility. Any number of games could be played on cartridges, which were inserted into the set like cassette tapes. Introduced shortly before the big Christmas selling season, the new games initially failed to conclusively  dislodge  the old, single-purpose products. In addition, the company had come up against steep competition from several of its competitors, who also had introduced multipurpose video game equipment. Throughout 1978, Atari saw its new product  languish  on the shelves. This disappointing news was compounded by administrative confusion at company headquarters. Original Atari employees felt no loyalty toward their new bosses, and top administrators also disagreed with some of Warner's key decisions. After a chaotic budget meeting in New York, Bushnell was ousted from his position as chair of the company. In his place, executives with backgrounds at large companies were installed, and procedures and practices at Atari became much more  businesslike . In an effort to sell off some of the backlogged inventory of slow-moving games that the company had built up, Atari launched a $6 million advertising campaign in the last seven weeks of 1978, designed to clear out inventory and make way for new products. The strategy worked. At the important, industry-wide Consumer Electronics Show in January 1979, store owners demanded more products to sell. Over the next 12 months, Atari was able to sell all of the game devices it manufactured. In addition to its game operations, Atari ambitiously branched out into the  hotly  competitive personal computer field, introducing two models, dubbed the Atari 400 and the Atari 800. These were intended for the home rather than office market. In the company's second year of operation in this field, it lost about $10 million on sales of twice that amount. With the start of the 1980s, however, Atari's successes in the video game field more than made up for its losses in other areas, as its growth and profits shot up. In January 1980, Atari began an effort to shift the emphasis of the video game industry away from holiday-generated sales, to prove that people were willing to buy video games all year round. To do this, Atari introduced four new video game cartridges late in the first month of the year. The tactic was successful, and demand for the company's product continued to build. By the end of the year, Atari had sold all of the video game machines that it had manufactured. Among its biggest selling cartridges was Space Invaders, an adaptation of a coin-operated arcade game originally designed in Japan. Atari's arcade operations were also going strong. In 1980, the company introduced Asteroids to compete with the Space Invaders arcade game, which was produced by another company. Atari's version proved to be a popular alternative. By the end of the year, 70,000 of the units had been shipped. Overall, revenues from coin-operated games reached $170 million, up from $52 million the year before. In addition to its arcade business, in 1980 Atari also began to explore the market for its products overseas. The company's overall revenues had more than doubled in just one year, topping $415 million, and its operating income had increased by five times. Because the sale of video cartridges was extremely profitable, Atari introduced new games at a steady pace, releasing titles at the rate of one per month. In 1981, with demand running at  feverish  pitch, the company decided to ration its product. More than one million cartridges of Space Invaders had been sold. All in all, with its competitors falling by the  wayside , Atari was the world's largest producer of video games, holding 80 percent of the American market. At the end of 1981, the company had sold more than $740 million worth of video game equipment and cartridges. In addition, its home computer operations had become profitable, and Atari products dominated the sales of low-priced machines. To protect its strong market position in the video game field, Atari also began an aggressive effort to shut down video game pirates by taking legal action against them. In November 1981, the company won an important case against a company that was selling a  copycat  ""Centipede"" game. Although Atari was aggressive in introducing  lucrative  new software, it lagged behind in marketing new hardware. Essentially, the company had not followed its introduction of the Video Computer System with a second, more sophisticated generation, except to produce a remote-control model, known as Touch Me, which cost $100 more than the basic set. The introduction of a Pac-Man cartridge in the spring of 1982, however, helped to stave off these concerns, as the company estimated that it would sell nine million of the games, to reap over $200 million in that year alone. Pac-Man was a breakthrough game, attracting many women and families to the video game market for the first time, and thereby expanding the industry's consumer base. In the fall of that year, Atari also took steps to update its game equipment, introducing a more elaborate version of its game machine, which sold for $350. It also quadrupled its sales of personal computers. In general, Atari poured tens of millions of dollars into research and development, in an effort to stay in front of the competitive industry. Despite these efforts, however, by the end of 1982, Atari's rise in the industry, which many had believed would continue indefinitely, had been checked. Competition in the video games industry had expanded dramatically as new companies rushed in to the lucrative field. Now, Atari faced more than 30 other game makers, some of which had lured away the company's top game designers, a damaging loss in a field where innovation was suddenly as important as distribution. On December 8, 1982, Atari's corporate parent, Warner Communications, announced that previous sales estimates would not be met because of ""unexpected cancellations and disappointing sales during the first week of December,"" as the New York Times reported at the time. In the wake of this sudden news, the company's stock value dropped precipitously, and several Atari executives were later investigated for insider stock trading, because they had sold off large blocks of stock just before the announcement. Following this  setback , Atari announced in February 1983 that it would fire 1,700 U.S. workers to move manufacturing facilities to Hong Kong and Taiwan. This move set off a wave of protest. In the financial community, it was taken as the sign of a company  adrift , since Atari had hired 2,500 new U.S. workers just the year before in a campaign to build up its domestic production capacity, only to  undo  itself a short time later. In addition, Atari found itself being challenged by competitors in its home computer business. In May 1983, the company reduced the price of its  outmoded  400 computer by two-thirds, from $299 to $100. By the end of its first quarter, losses overall had reached $46 million. In an effort to restore some of the original creative  luster  to Atari, the company announced an agreement with ousted founder Nolan Bushnell to sell consumer versions of the coin-operated games he was developing in his new business. By September 1983, quarterly losses had reached $180.3 million, and its nine-month losses reached $536.4 million. The company ended the year with overall losses of $538.6 million on sales of $1.12  billion , half its previous year sales of $2 billion. To stem Atari's losses, Warner brought in a new head executive who fired more than half the company's 10,000 employees. Nevertheless, costs could not be brought in line with revenues, and the company needed an  infusion  of further funds to pay for research on new products. Unable to support this continuing drain on its resources, Warner Communications began to look for a buyer for its failing subsidiary. In July 1984, the company announced that it had agreed to sell all Atari operations, with the exception of the small coin-operated arcade video game business and a new telecommunications venture, called Ataritel, to Jack Tramiel, a businessperson who had made his reputation as the head of Commodore International, Ltd., a computer company. The price for Atari was $240 million. Three days after purchasing the company, Tramiel began his own aggressive effort to cut costs, laying off hundreds more employees and taking steps to collect outstanding funds owed to the company. Unable to sell  unwanted  video game cartridges, Atari dumped truckloads of them into a  landfill  in New Mexico. Tramiel installed three of his sons in top management positions, brought in former associates to fill other key spots, and made plans to raise funds through the sale of stock to the public. To Tramiel, Atari was  poised  to become a computer manufacturer to rival his previous company, despite the fact that its extant computer offering, the 800XL, was outmoded and less powerful than its competitors. In January 1985, Atari unveiled two new lines of home computers, the XE series-man improved version of the old 800XL made cheaper by a reduction in the number of components and renegotiated contracts with suppliers--and the ST line, a cut-rate imitation of the Apple Macintosh, that used a color screen, fancy graphics, and a mouse, in an effort to move in on the market for Apple computers in the home. By July, the 520-ST had started to make its way into stores. The computer arrived past schedule, with no advertising to announce its presence, and no software to demonstrate its capabilities. Many machines in the first  shipment  did not work at all because microchips inside had been shaken loose in transit. Nevertheless, with a price of $799, the product initially seemed to have found a receptive public, with a large percentage of sales taking place in Europe. Despite this good news, Tramiel continued to run Atari in crisis mode. The company's U.S. staff had shrunk to 150, and in May 1985, executives agreed to have one-third of their salaries withheld indefinitely. The company finished out 1985 posting a loss of $26.7 million. By 1986, the industry in which Atari originally made its mark, video games, was beginning to show signs of life once again. This time, however, product lines were led by sophisticated, expensive Japanese equipment, sold by companies such as Nintendo and Sega. Atari re-entered the field with its old machine, the VCS 2600, which sold for only $40, and also introduced the 7800, a more advanced unit, which sold for twice as much. The company also began a modest advertising campaign for these products for the first time in two years. By the end of the year, these efforts, combined with Atari's home computer sales, had resulted in profits of $45 million, on sales of $258 million. With these strong results, the company was able to offer stock to the public for the first time in November 1986. With these funds, Atari increased its advertising budget in support of new products it introduced. In 1987, the company began to market a clone of IBM's PC, priced at under $500, as well as a more sophisticated video game console, in addition to introducing products for the desktop publishing field. In October 1987, Atari purchased the Federated Group, a chain of 62 electronics stores based in California and the Southwest, for $67 million. Tramiel hoped that the stores could provide a good distribution outlet for Atari products, and he put his youngest son in charge of the chain. Operating in a depressed area of the country, however, Federated continued to lose money, and the company was forced to shut the stores after just one year. At the end of 1987, Atari held 20 percent of the U.S. video game market and relied on foreign sales of its home computers, which remained unpopular in the United States, for a significant portion of its income. Overall, the company earned $57 million, on sales that neared $500 million. The following year, Atari once again allied itself with its founder, Nolan Bushnell, agreeing to market video games that he had developed. Furthermore, the company announced another big advertising push, in an effort to ensure that the video game crash that had threatened Atari in the early 1980s would not recur. Atari also turned to the courts in December 1988, charging that Nintendo's licensing policies monopolized the market. These moves reflected the continuing lack of demand for Atari's home computer products in the United States, as the company, hampered by its image as a toymaker rather than a high-tech  powerhouse , fought for part of this highly competitive market. In January 1989, Nintendo followed up Atari's suit with a countersuit charging copyright  infringement , and by the end of the year, the dispute had reached the U.S. House of Representatives, whose  subcommittee  on anti-trust echoed Atari's charges. In November 1989, Atari continued its push into the game market by introducing a portable video game player called Lynx, which sold for $200, to compete with Nintendo's popular Game Boy. The company finished out the year with earnings of $4.02 million. In the spring of 1990, Atari introduced its Portfolio palmtop personal computer. Early the following year, the company came out with a revamped, color Lynx product, and several months later it introduced new notebook computers. Despite these advances, however, Atari was in trouble. Sales of its home computers in Europe began to flag as the company faced increased competition, and in 1991 foreign sales collapsed. In the video games field, Atari's efforts to challenge Nintendo through legal means had been rebuffed, and the company was unable to regain significant market share from its Japanese competitors. By the first quarter of 1992, losses over a three-month period had reached $14 million. In September 1992, Atari took steps to stem its losses by cutting its research and development expenditures in half and closing branch offices in three states. The company hoped that the introduction of new products, such as the Falcon030 multimedia home entertainment computer would help to revive its fortunes. In addition, the company was working on a more sophisticated video game machine, called the ""Jaguar."" Nevertheless, 1992 ended with a loss of $73 million. As Atari began to ship its Falcon030 system to stores in small numbers in early 1993, the company's fate was unclear. Decidedly, it was experiencing another severe  downturn , which by the summer had snowballed into what the San Jose Mercury News called a full-fledged financial  meltdown : between the second quarters of 1992 and 1993 Atari's sales plummeted 76 percent to only $5.7 million. Sales of its hand-held Lynx games were poor and its Falcon systems were barely visible in the PC marketplace. Atari's hopes now rested on the vaunted 64-bit technology of its soon-to-be-unveiled Jaguar game system, which promised to unseat Sega and Nintendo with the next generation of ""high-performance interactive multimedia."" In June 1993, IBM signed a $500 million deal with Atari to manufacture Jaguar's hardware, and the first sets hit stores in November. As Jaguar tested the  marketplace  in 1994, Atari settled a licensing dispute with Nintendo by way of an agreement with former parent Time Warner to raise its stake in Atari to 27 percent. Atari also licensed Jaguar to Sigma Design of California, whose full-motion video technology promised to enable Atari to make the jump from dedicated video game players to the home PC. In September 1994, arch rival Sega also agreed to pay Atari $90 million for the rights to Atari's 70 U.S. game patents. Finally, a partnership with Britain's Virtuality Group seemed to promise a new cutting-edge application for the Jaguar platform: Atari and Virtuality would design a 3-D virtual reality home gaming system to debut in 1995. Within a year of Jaguar's introduction Atari boasted 30 titles for the system, and in mid-1995 Atari announced a CD accessory that would allow CD-ROM games to be played on the Jaguar platform. All Atari's partnerships and cross-platform efforts, however, could not convince consumers to abandon Sega's Saturn and Nintendo's Playstation for Jaguar, and in October 1995 Atari announced that third quarter revenues had fallen a brutal 40 percent from the previous year. Atari responded by slashing Jaguar's retail price and announcing ""Atari Interactive,"" a new division to make CD-ROM video games for PCs. The writing was on the wall, however, and in January 1996 Jaguar was pulled from the U.S. market. A month later Atari announced that JTS Corporation, a San Jose-based disk drive maker whose 1994 startup Jack Tramiel had helped fund, would merge with Atari in June. Although Atari publicly maintained that it would continue to market video game consoles and software as a  JTS 's Atari Division, it soon became clear that Atari's attraction for JTS was not its game technology but its still  sizable  cash reserves, which JTS would tap to battle disk drive competitors like  Seagate  and Quantum. When the JTS merger was finalized in mid-1996 Atari's staff was  gutted  by 80 percent and its assets liquidated. Some Atari titles lived on through its licensing agreement with Sega, but by the end of 1996 Atari's quarter-century history as an early video entertainment pioneer had come to an end. In February 1998 JTS sold Atari's intellectual property as well as its famous name to  Hasbro Interactive , but even this $5 million dollar sale wasn't enough to save JTS, which declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 1999. There was really nothing left of Atari but its name when Hasbro Interactive again sold the company, this time to Infogrames Entertainment S.A., in 2001. On May 7, 2003, Infogrames announced that it was changing the name of its U.S. operations to Atari. Its NASDAQ symbol was likewise changed to ATAR. Though Atari lived on in name, its future history would be written by Infogrames. Further Reading Bernstein, Peter W., ""Atari and the Video-Game Explosion,""  Fortune,  July 27, 1981.

Home  >  Library  >  Entertainment & Arts  >  Gaming Personalities            Company Bio  On June 27, 1972, Nolan Bushnell formed a company to produce and publish  Pong . His first choice for the company's name, ""Sygyzy,"" was taken, so Atari, Inc. was born instead. (The word ""Atari"" comes from the Japanese game Go, where it has roughly the same meaning as ""check"" in chess.)  Pong  became an immediate phenomenon, establishing Atari as a leader in the newly formed coin-op industry. A home version of  Pong  followed in 1974. Attracted by the company's success and potential, Warner Communications bought Atari, Inc. from Bushnell in 1976 for $28 million.   In late 1977, Atari released the  Atari Video Computer System , a game console with interchangable cartridges. Sales of the $199 system were slow at first, but exploded in 1980 with the release of a home version of the arcade hit  Space Invaders . The company entered the home computer market in 1979 with the  Atari 400  and  Atari 800 , and continued as a leading coin-op publisher, releasing games such as  Breakout ,  Asteroids ,  Missile Command ,  Battlezone  and  Tempest  in the late '70s and early '80s.   After years of unprecedented success, chinks began to appear in Atari's armor. In 1982,  Pac-Man  and  E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial  for the  VCS  were high-profile disappointments, both financially and creatively, and the next-generation  Atari 5200  console failed to generate much interest. Still, Atari remained profitable. 1983 was much worse, as a glut of low-quality games flooded the market and interest in home video games waned. The company posted losses of $536 million for the year.     The next year marked the end of Atari, Inc. as a unified console, computer and coin-op manufacturer. In 1984, Warner split the company in two, selling off the computer and home divisions to Jack Tramiel, and retaining the coin-op divisions for itself.

It is currently owned by Atari Interactive, a wholly owned subsidiary of the French publisher  Infogrames Entertainment SA  (IESA). [ 1 ]   The original  Atari Inc.  was founded in 1972 by  Nolan Bushnell  and  Ted Dabney . It was a pioneer in  arcade games , home  video game consoles , and  home computers . The company's products, such as  Pong  and the  Atari 2600 , helped define the  computer  entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid 1980s.   In 1984, the original Atari Inc. was split, and the arcade division was turned into  Atari Games Inc. . [ 2 ] Atari Games received the rights to use the logo and brand name with appended text ""Games"" on arcade games, as well as rights to the original 1972 - 1984 arcade hardware properties. The Atari Consumer Electronics Division properties were in turn sold to  Jack Tramiel's  Tramel Technology Ltd., which then renamed itself to  Atari Corporation . [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  In 1996, Atari Corporation reverse merged with disk drive manufacturer  JT Storage  (JTS), [ 5 ]  becoming a division within the company.   Atari Interactive started as a subsidiary of  Hasbro Interactive [ 6 ] , after Hasbro Interactive acquired all Atari Corporation related properties from JTS in 1998. [ 7 ] IESA in turn acquired Hasbro Interactive in 2001, and proceeded to rename it to  Infogrames Interactive .  [ 8 ]  In 2003, IESA then changed the company name entirely to Atari Interactive. [ 1 ]   The company that currently bears the name  Atari Inc.  was founded in 1993 under the name  GT Interactive . IESA acquired a 62% controlling interest in GT Interactive in 1999, and proceeded to rename it  Infogrames, Inc. [ 9 ]  After IESA's acquirement of Hasbro Interactive and its related Atari properties in 2001, Infogrames, Inc. intermittently published Atari branded titles for Infogrames Interactive. In 2003, Infogrames Inc. licensed the Atari name and logo from Atari Interactive and changed its name to Atari Inc. [ 10 ] . On October 11th, 2008, Infogrames completed its acquisition of Atari, Inc., making it a wholly owned subsidiary.  [ 11 ]           Contents       1   History     1.1   Atari Inc.

(1972-1984)       Main article:  Atari, Inc       In 1971,  Nolan Bushnell  and Ted Dabney founded an engineering firm,  Syzygy Engineering , [ 12 ]  that designed and built the first arcade video game - Computer Space for Nutting Associates. On June 27, 1972 Atari, Inc. was incorporated and soon hired  Al Alcorn  as their first design engineer. Bushnell decided to have Alcorn produce as a test of his abilities, an arcade version of the  Magnavox Odyssey 's Tennis game, [ 13 ]  which would be named  Pong . While Bushnell incorporate Atari in June of 1972, Syzygy Company was never formally incorporated. Before Atari's official incorporation, Bushnell wrote down several words from the game  Go , eventually choosing  atari , a term which in the context of the game means a state where a  stone  or group of stones is imminently in danger of being taken by one's opponent. In Japanese,  atari  is the nominalized form of  ataru  (verb), meaning ""to hit the target"" or ""to receive something fortuitously"". The word 'atari' is used in Japanese when a prediction comes true or when someone wins a lottery. The choice of Atari as a brand name was arguably better than Syzygy for most markets in terms of spelling, pronunciation and potential name recognition. Atari was incorporated in the state of California on June 27th, 1972. [ 14 ]          The third version of the Atari  Video Computer System  sold from 1980 to 1981       In 1973, Atari secretly spawned a ""competitor"" called  Kee Games , headed by Nolan's next door neighbor Joe Keenan, to circumvent  pinball  distributors' insistence on exclusive distribution deals; both Atari and Kee could market (virtually) the same game to different distributors, with each getting an ""exclusive"" deal. Though Kee's relationship to Atari was discovered in 1974, Joe Keenan did such a good job managing the subsidiary that he was promoted to president of Atari that same year.   In 1976, Bushnell, through a Grass Valley, CA. engineering firm - Cyan Engineering, started an effort to produce a flexible video game console that was capable of playing all four of Atari's then-current games. The result was the  Atari 2600 , one of the most successful consoles in history, sometimes called VCS for Video Computer System. Authors on the history of videogames have consistently presented the possibility the 2600 was named after the frequency  2600 hertz  used by a blue box to gain control of telephone networks, or "" 2600: The Hacker Quarterly ,"" which began as a magazine for telephone  phreaking . Bushnell knew he had another potential hit on his hands, but bringing the machine to market would be extremely expensive. Looking for outside investors, in 1976 Bushnell sold Atari to  Warner Communications  for an estimated $28 - $32 million, using part of the money to buy the  Folgers  Mansion. He departed from the division in 1979.   A project to design a successor to the 2600 started as soon as the system shipped. The original development team estimated the 2600 had a lifespan of about three years, and decided to build the most powerful machine they could, given that time frame. Midway into the effort's time-frame, the  home computer  revolution was taking off, so the new machines were adapted, with the addition of a keyboard and various inputs, to produce the  Atari 800 , and its smaller cousin, the 400. Although a variety of issues made them less attractive than the  Apple II  for some users, the new machines had some success when they finally became available in quantity in 1980.   Under Warner, Atari Inc. achieved its greatest success, selling millions of 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time. However, Atari Inc. ran into problems in the early 1980s. Its  home computer ,  video game console , and  arcade  divisions operated independently of one another and rarely cooperated. Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to duplicate the success of the 2600.   These problems were followed by the infamous  video game crash of 1983 , with losses that totaled more than $500 million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20, and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division. In 1983, Ray Kassar was forced to leave Atari, and executives involved in the  Famicom  deal were forced to start over again, and the deal eventually died. With Atari's further financial problems and the Famicom's runaway success in Japan after its July 16th, 1983 release date,  Nintendo  decided to go it alone.   Financial problems continued to mount and Ray's successor,  James J. Morgan , had less than a year in which to tackle his predecessor's problems before he, too, left. In July 1984, Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to  Jack Tramiel  for $240 million in stocks  [ 15 ]  who then used it to create a new company under the name  Atari Corporation . Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name  Atari Games , but sold it to  Namco  in 1985. Warner also sold the fledgling  Ataritel  to  Mitsubishi .     [ edit ]   Atari Corporation (1984 - 1996)       Main article:  Atari Corporation              Atari ST       Under Tramiel's ownership,  Atari Corp.  used the remaining stock of game console inventory to keep the company afloat while they finished development on a 16-bit computer system, the  Atari ST . In April of 1985, they released the first update to the 8-bit computer line - the Atari 65XE, the  Atari XE  series. In June of 1985 saw the release of the Atari 130XE and Atari User Group's received early sneak-preview samples of the new Atari 520ST's and major retailer shipments hit store shelves in September of 1985 of Atari's new 16-bit  Atari ST  computers. In 1986, Atari launched two consoles designed under Warner - the Atari 2600jr and the  Atari 7800  console (which saw limited release in 1984). Atari rebounded, making $25 million profit that year. In 1989, Atari released the  Atari Lynx , a handheld console with color graphics, to much fanfare. A shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season and the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo's  Game Boy , which only had a black and white display, but was available. Tramiel emphasized computers over game consoles. At the time Atari like HP personal computers had their own operating systems which fell victim to Microsoft's success. But, gaming revived and Tramiel missed the boat. Also in 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly. [ 16 ]  Atari eventually lost the case when it was rejected by a  US district court  in 1992. [ 17 ]   In 1993, Atari positioned its  Jaguar  as the only 64-bit interactive media entertainment system available, and sold around 200,000 units (at $250 each) in its first year on the market.

(formerly Infogrames Inc./ GT Interactive )       Industry   Consumer electronics ,  video game       Products   video games ,  consumer electronics       Atari  is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972. It is currently owned by Atari Interactive, a wholly owned subsidiary of the French publisher  Infogrames Entertainment SA  (IESA). [ 1 ]   The original  Atari Inc.  was founded in 1972 by  Nolan Bushnell  and  Ted Dabney . It was a pioneer in  arcade games , home  video game consoles , and  home computers . The company's products, such as  Pong  and the  Atari 2600 , helped define the  computer  entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid 1980s.   In 1984, the original Atari Inc. was split, and the arcade division was turned into  Atari Games Inc. . [ 2 ] Atari Games received the rights to use the logo and brand name with appended text ""Games"" on arcade games, as well as rights to the original 1972 - 1984 arcade hardware properties. The Atari Consumer Electronics Division properties were in turn sold to  Jack Tramiel's  Tramel Technology Ltd., which then renamed itself to  Atari Corporation . [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  In 1996, Atari Corporation reverse merged with disk drive manufacturer  JT Storage  (JTS), [ 5 ]  becoming a division within the company.   Atari Interactive started as a subsidiary of  Hasbro Interactive [ 6 ] , after Hasbro Interactive acquired all Atari Corporation related properties from JTS in 1998. [ 7 ] IESA in turn acquired Hasbro Interactive in 2001, and proceeded to rename it to  Infogrames Interactive .  [ 8 ]  In 2003, IESA then changed the company name entirely to Atari Interactive. [ 1 ]   The company that currently bears the name  Atari Inc.  was founded in 1993 under the name  GT Interactive . IESA acquired a 62% controlling interest in GT Interactive in 1999, and proceeded to rename it  Infogrames, Inc. [ 9 ]  After IESA's acquirement of Hasbro Interactive and its related Atari properties in 2001, Infogrames, Inc. intermittently published Atari branded titles for Infogrames Interactive. In 2003, Infogrames Inc. licensed the Atari name and logo from Atari Interactive and changed its name to Atari Inc. [ 10 ] . On October 11th, 2008, Infogrames completed its acquisition of Atari, Inc., making it a wholly owned subsidiary.  [ 11 ]           Contents       1   History     1.1   Atari Inc.

(1972-1984)       Main article:  Atari, Inc       In 1971,  Nolan Bushnell  and Ted Dabney founded an engineering firm,  Syzygy Engineering , [ 12 ]  that designed and built the first arcade video game - Computer Space for Nutting Associates. On June 27, 1972 Atari, Inc. was incorporated and soon hired  Al Alcorn  as their first design engineer. Bushnell decided to have Alcorn produce as a test of his abilities, an arcade version of the  Magnavox Odyssey 's Tennis game, [ 13 ]  which would be named  Pong . While Bushnell incorporate Atari in June of 1972, Syzygy Company was never formally incorporated. Before Atari's official incorporation, Bushnell wrote down several words from the game  Go , eventually choosing  atari , a term which in the context of the game means a state where a  stone  or group of stones is imminently in danger of being taken by one's opponent. In Japanese,  atari  is the nominalized form of  ataru  (verb), meaning ""to hit the target"" or ""to receive something fortuitously"". The word 'atari' is used in Japanese when a prediction comes true or when someone wins a lottery. The choice of Atari as a brand name was arguably better than Syzygy for most markets in terms of spelling, pronunciation and potential name recognition. Atari was incorporated in the state of California on June 27th, 1972. [ 14 ]          The third version of the Atari  Video Computer System  sold from 1980 to 1981       In 1973, Atari secretly spawned a ""competitor"" called  Kee Games , headed by Nolan's next door neighbor Joe Keenan, to circumvent  pinball  distributors' insistence on exclusive distribution deals; both Atari and Kee could market (virtually) the same game to different distributors, with each getting an ""exclusive"" deal. Though Kee's relationship to Atari was discovered in 1974, Joe Keenan did such a good job managing the subsidiary that he was promoted to president of Atari that same year.   In 1976, Bushnell, through a Grass Valley, CA. engineering firm - Cyan Engineering, started an effort to produce a flexible video game console that was capable of playing all four of Atari's then-current games. The result was the  Atari 2600 , one of the most successful consoles in history, sometimes called VCS for Video Computer System. Authors on the history of videogames have consistently presented the possibility the 2600 was named after the frequency  2600 hertz  used by a blue box to gain control of telephone networks, or "" 2600: The Hacker Quarterly ,"" which began as a magazine for telephone  phreaking . Bushnell knew he had another potential hit on his hands, but bringing the machine to market would be extremely expensive. Looking for outside investors, in 1976 Bushnell sold Atari to  Warner Communications  for an estimated $28 - $32 million, using part of the money to buy the  Folgers  Mansion. He departed from the division in 1979.   A project to design a successor to the 2600 started as soon as the system shipped. The original development team estimated the 2600 had a lifespan of about three years, and decided to build the most powerful machine they could, given that time frame. Midway into the effort's time-frame, the  home computer  revolution was taking off, so the new machines were adapted, with the addition of a keyboard and various inputs, to produce the  Atari 800 , and its smaller cousin, the 400. Although a variety of issues made them less attractive than the  Apple II  for some users, the new machines had some success when they finally became available in quantity in 1980.   Under Warner, Atari Inc. achieved its greatest success, selling millions of 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time. However, Atari Inc. ran into problems in the early 1980s. Its  home computer ,  video game console , and  arcade  divisions operated independently of one another and rarely cooperated. Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to duplicate the success of the 2600.   These problems were followed by the infamous  video game crash of 1983 , with losses that totaled more than $500 million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20, and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division. In 1983, Ray Kassar was forced to leave Atari, and executives involved in the  Famicom  deal were forced to start over again, and the deal eventually died. With Atari's further financial problems and the Famicom's runaway success in Japan after its July 16th, 1983 release date,  Nintendo  decided to go it alone.   Financial problems continued to mount and Ray's successor,  James J. Morgan , had less than a year in which to tackle his predecessor's problems before he, too, left. In July 1984, Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to  Jack Tramiel  for $240 million in stocks  [ 15 ]  who then used it to create a new company under the name  Atari Corporation . Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name  Atari Games , but sold it to  Namco  in 1985. Warner also sold the fledgling  Ataritel  to  Mitsubishi .     [ edit ]   Atari Corporation (1984 - 1996)       Main article:  Atari Corporation              Atari ST       Under Tramiel's ownership,  Atari Corp.  used the remaining stock of game console inventory to keep the company afloat while they finished development on a 16-bit computer system, the  Atari ST . In April of 1985, they released the first update to the 8-bit computer line - the Atari 65XE, the  Atari XE  series. In June of 1985 saw the release of the Atari 130XE and Atari User Group's received early sneak-preview samples of the new Atari 520ST's and major retailer shipments hit store shelves in September of 1985 of Atari's new 16-bit  Atari ST  computers. In 1986, Atari launched two consoles designed under Warner - the Atari 2600jr and the  Atari 7800  console (which saw limited release in 1984). Atari rebounded, making $25 million profit that year. In 1989, Atari released the  Atari Lynx , a handheld console with color graphics, to much fanfare. A shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season and the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo's  Game Boy , which only had a black and white display, but was available. Tramiel emphasized computers over game consoles. At the time Atari like HP personal computers had their own operating systems which fell victim to Microsoft's success. But, gaming revived and Tramiel missed the boat. Also in 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly. [ 16 ]  Atari eventually lost the case when it was rejected by a  US district court  in 1992. [ 17 ]   In 1993, Atari positioned its  Jaguar  as the only 64-bit interactive media entertainment system available, and sold around 200,000 units (at $250 each) in its first year on the market.   By 1996, a series of successful lawsuits [ 18 ]  had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank, but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari without a product to sell. Tramiel and his family also wanted out of the business. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. In July 1996, Atari merged with  JTS Inc. , a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, to form JTS Corp. [ 19 ]  Atari's role in the new company largely became that of holder for the Atari properties and minor support, and consequently the name largely disappeared from the market.     [ edit ]   As a division of Hasbro (1998-2001)       Main article:  Atari Interactive       In March 1998, JTS sold the Atari name and assets to Hasbro Interactive for $5 millionless than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. This transaction primarily involved the  brand  and  intellectual property , which now fell under the Atari Interactive division of Hasbro Interactive. The brand name changed hands again in December 2000 when French software publisher  Infogrames  took over  Hasbro Interactive .

Atari, Inc.     Type   Wholly owned subsidiary of Infogrames       Founded   2003  as Atari Inc. (formerly Infogrames Inc./ GT Interactive )       Headquarters   New York, N.Y. ,  U.S.       Key people   Jim Wilson, CEO  Diane Price Baker, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer       Industry   video game       Products   Test Drive ,  Alone in the Dark ,  Godzilla ,  Neverwinter Nights ,  RollerCoaster Tycoon 3       Revenue    $ 218 million ( 2006 )       Net income    $ 68 million ( 2006 )       Employees   232 ( 2006 )       Parent   Infogrames       Website   www.atari.com       The company that currently bears the  Atari Inc.  name was founded in 1993 under the name  GT Interactive . In 1999,  Infogrames Entertainment SA  (IESA) acquired a 62% controlling interest in GT Interactive, and proceeded to rename it  Infogrames, Inc. [ 1 ]  After IESA's acquirement of Hasbro Interactive and its related Atari properties in 2001, Infogrames, Inc. intermittently published Atari branded titles for Infogrames Interactive. In 2003, Infogrames Inc. licensed the Atari name and logo from Atari Interactive and changed its name to Atari Inc. [ 2 ]  On October 11th, 2008 Infogrames completed its acquisition of Atari, Inc., making it a wholly owned subsidiary.  [ 3 ]   Atari Inc. is being moved towards  Phil Harrison 's vision of online publication and distribution of video games.

It was battery-operated and shaped similarly to an Atari 2600 joystick, and included A/V ports. In 2004, the same company created a device called Atari Paddle Games, in the shape of one of the 2600s ""paddle"" controllers with appropriate titles included. However, as stated, neither of the games was directly released by Atari.   The same year that the Paddle Games were released, Atari released a TV game of their own which they called the  Atari Flashback  Console. The device was designed and produced by Atari consultant Curt Vendel through his engineering firm Legacy Engineering. With only a 10 week development window, what they produced looked like a minute version of the Atari 7800 console originally released in 1984, 20 years prior. The two controllers were small as well, having a joystick and two red buttons on each side. Twenty titles were built into the system. Unlike most plug-and-plays, the Flashback was not powered by batteries, but an (included) AC adaptor instead. The Flashback did fairly well in sales. Since the games were all recreated on hardware more closely resembling the  Nintendo Entertainment System  than the  7800 , some of the aspects of certain games concerning the sound, graphics, or gameplay were either changed or omitted.           Atari Flashback  Console       Because of popular demand, Atari hired Curt Vendel once again to produce a follow up product. With a longer development window, Vendel released a new version of the Flashback console, titled  Atari Flashback 2 , in August 2005. The Flashback 2 is based on an implementation of the original Atari 2600 on a single chip that Curt Vendel designed, allowing the original 2600 games to be run instead of ports as in the first Flashback. In addition, the included joysticks are fully compatible with the original 2600 joysticks and vice-versa. Furthermore, the circuitboard in the Flashback 2 actually has connectors for modders to solder on a cartridge slot, allowing the Flashback 2 to play the entire library of 2600 games.   Also, in late October 2005, Atari released one of two collections of its classic arcade games only for the  Nokia N-Gage  console, titled Atari Masterpieces. Atari Masterpieces Volume I includes classic arcade games:  Asteroids ,  Battlezone ,  Black Widow ,  Millipede ,  Missile Command ,  Red Baron ,  Lunar Lander  and  Super Breakout , and features an exclusive interview with Nolan Bushnell. Atari Masterpieces Volume II was released in March 2006.   On  May 5 ,  2006 , Atari and Hasbro stopped  Bioware  and DLA from further development of premium modules and publishing near-completed premium modules for  Neverwinter Nights . No reason was stated, but it was likely in anticipation of the upcoming sequel,  Neverwinter Nights 2 , which would lack features from these modules. They relented after community backlash.   Recently, Atari's top-selling titles have been the  Dragon Ball Z  games based on the popular anime license from  Toei Animation  in  Japan . These include the  Dragon Ball Z: Budokai  series of games for next-generation console systems and the  Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku  series of games for the  Game Boy Advance . These games have topped the  best-seller charts  for numerous console platforms since the release of Atari's first  Dragon Ball Z  game,  The Legacy of Goku  in 2002, which was the first  Dragon Ball  game to be made by an American company,  Webfoot Technologies , and is one of the best-selling Game Boy Advance games of all time (#16). The best selling  Budokai  series is developed in Japan by  Dimps  and includes  Dragon Ball Z: Budokai ,  Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2  and  Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3 ). Atari is also releasing  Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi  and its sequel,  Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2  which is a separate series from the Budokai series. Following the success of the Budokai and Legacy of Goku series, Atari has released numerous other Dragon Ball titles including  Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors ,  Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors 2 ,  Dragon Ball Z: Sagas ,  Dragon Ball GT: Transformation ,  Dragon Ball: Advanced Adventure  and  Super Dragon Ball Z .   Atari also released a series of games based on the  Matrix  movie trilogy including  Enter the Matrix  and  The Matrix: Path of Neo . Although not critical successes, these titles represent some of the most expensive video games ever developed. Enter the Matrix, which was developed by  Shiny Entertainment , sold 1.38 million units for the  PlayStation 2  and 1 million units for the  Nintendo GameCube .   Another popular series by Atari has been the Godzilla Series, based on the nuclear dinosaur originally created by Toho. Pipeworks developed and created all of these titles, and are expected to keep doing so in the future. The series started with ""Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee"" for the Gamecube and Xbox which was released in October 11, 2002. It was followed by Godzilla: Save the Earth for the Playstation 2 and the Xbox, on November 16, 2004. The newest version of the Godzilla franchise, is  Godzilla: Unleashed  for the  PS2  and  Wii , which was a milestone in the Atari Godzilla Franchise. It was shipped on December 5, 2007. Unleashed was accompanied by  Godzilla Unleashed: Double Smash  for the Nintendo DS, which was released on November 20, 2007.   Other currently popular titles for Atari include  RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 ,  Test Drive Unlimited ,  Neverwinter Nights ,  Godzilla  games, the  Alone in the Dark  series  and the  Driver  series (recently sold to  Ubisoft  for a reported $24 million [ 5 ] ).     [ edit ]   Atari Inc. corporate history   On  September 1 ,  2006 , Atari Inc. announced that its stock faces  delisting  from  NASDAQ  since its price had fallen under $1.00.  [ 6 ]  On  September 5 ,  2006 ,  David Pierce  was appointed as new  CEO  of Atari, replacing  Bruno Bonnell . Pierce previously worked as an  executive  at  Universal Pictures ,  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ,  Sony Pictures Entertainment ,  Sony Music Entertainment , and  Sony Wonder .  [ 7 ]   On  October 2 ,  2006 , Atari Inc. announced that it had sold off  Shiny Entertainment  to  Foundation 9 Entertainment , which culminated in the completion of their strategic divesture. [ 8 ]   On  April 5 ,  2007 ,  Bruno Bonnell  resigned his position as  chairman  and  chief financial officer . [ 9 ]   On  November 7 ,  2007 ,  Gamespot  reported that Atari was beginning to run out of money, losing two million in the first fiscal year of 2008 and announced that were selling the rights of the Test Drive game series for the Infogrames . [ 10 ]   On  March 6 ,  2008 , Infogrames made an offer to Atari Inc. to buy out all remaining public shares for a value of US$1.68 per share or US$11 million total. The offer would make Infogrames sole owner of Atari Inc., making it a privately held company.  [ 11 ] .   On  April 30 ,  2008 , Atari Inc. announced its intentions to accept Infogrames' buyout offer and merge with Infogrames.  [ 12 ] .   On  May 9 ,  2008 , It was revealed that  Nasdaq  will be removing Atari from the Nasdaq stock market.  [ 13 ]  Atari has stated its intentions to appeal the decision. Atari was notified of Nasdaq's final decision April 24, 2008 and the appeal hearing took place on May 1, 2008. Atari was expected to raise its value to $15 million  USD  from the period December 20, 2007 through to March, 2008. Atari received notice of its absolute delisting on September 12th, 2008.  [ 14 ]   On October 11th, 2008 Infogrames completed its acquisition of Atari, Inc., making it a wholly owned subsidiary.  [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Software piracy   Atari was one of the companies using British legal company  Davenport Lyons  in 2008 to recover damages from computer users illegally downloading games but stopped using the company when they were made aware of the false claims being made against innocent members of the public.

The original company Atari was a pioneer in  arcade games , home  video game consoles , and  personal computers , and its dominance in those areas made it  the  major force in the  computer  entertainment industry in the early to mid  1980s . The brand has also been used at various times by  Atari Games , a separate company split off in  1984 .  Although the original Atari ceased to exist in  1996 , a large amount of underground development remains for Atari's game systems and computers of the  1970s  and  1980s , and much of the Classic Gaming Expo's attention, which has existed since  1997 , focuses on Atari.  The name  Atari  (当たり) comes from the ancient board game  Go , where ""atari"" is a Japanese term that applies to moves which threaten to capture opponent's stones. It may be used during polite games as a courtesy to make one's opponent aware of the potential threat. It is similar to "" check "" in chess.  See  Atari .     [ Top ] History   Since the early days of coin operated machines, Atari has been responsible for home consoles such as the  Atari 2600  (VCS); produced a series of  eight-bit computers  (Atari 400 & 800); taken part in the 16 bit computer revolution with the  Atari ST ; made the revolutionary (for its time) 64-bit  Atari Jaguar ; and released a hand held video game console, the  Atari Lynx .  Founded in the United States in  1972  by  Nolan Bushnell , Atari could be credited with starting the video arcade industry with the seminal  Pong . The home version of Pong, which connected to a television set, was also the first of the  video game consoles .  Bushnell sold Atari to  Warner Communications  in  1976  for an estimated $28 million to $32 million. Bushnell departed from the division in  1978 . While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600 consoles, and at its peak, it accounted for one third of Warner's annual income and became the fastest-growing company in history in the United States (at the time). Although it had garnered the lion's share of the home video game market, the 2600 experienced its first stiff competition in  1980  from  Mattel's   Intellivision , which featured ads touting its superior graphics capabilities relative to the 2600. Still, the 2600 remained the industry standard-bearer, due to its market superiority, and due to Atari featuring (by far) the greatest variety of game titles available.  However, Atari ran into problems in the early 1980s. Its  home computer ,  video game console , and  arcade  divisions operated independently of one another and rarely cooperated. Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to follow on the success of the 2600. In  1982 , Atari released disappointing versions of two highly publicized games,  Pac-Man  and  E.T. , causing a pileup of unsold inventory and depressing prices. Also in 1982, Atari settled a court case with  Activision , officially opening the 2600 to third-party development. The market quickly became saturated, depressing prices further. In addition, in December 1982, Atari executives Ray Kassar and Dennis Groth were investigated for insider trading (later found to be false). The  Atari 5200  game console, released as a next-generation followup to the 2600, was based on the Atari 800 computer (but was incompatible with Atari 800 game cartridges), and its sales never met the company's expectations. Some time during the  1980s , it is rumored Atari buried millions of unsold E.T. game cartridges in a  New Mexico   desert   landfill .  Still, Atari held a formidable position in the world video game market. They were the number one console maker in every market except  Japan . That market belonged to  Nintendo , who had released their first game console, the  Famicom  (known to the rest of the world as the  NES ) in  1983 . The system took Japan by storm, and Nintendo began to look to other markets. They approached Atari and offered a licensing deal - Atari would build and sell the system, paying Nintendo a royalty. The deal was all but done, and the two companies decided to formally sign the agreement at the 1983 Summer CES. Unfortunately, at that same show  Coleco  was showing their new Adam computer, and the display unit was running  Donkey Kong . But Atari owned the rights to publish Donkey Kong for computers. Atari CEO Ray Kassar had a fit, accusing Nintendo of double dealing with the Donkey Kong license. Nintendo in turn tore into Coleco. In the coming month, Ray Kassar was forced to leave Atari, and executives involved in the Famicom deal were forced to start over again from scratch.   These problems were followed by the infamous  video game crash of 1983 , which caused losses that totaled more than $500 million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20 and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division. As for Nintendo, Atari could no longer afford the Famicom deal, and eventually Nintendo would be forced to go it alone.  In July  1984 , Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to  Jack Tramiel , the recently ousted founder of Atari competitor  Commodore International , under the name  Atari Corp.  for $240 million. Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name  Atari Games .  Under Tramiel's ownership,  Atari Corp.  abandoned the game console market to concentrate on aggressively priced home computers, releasing the 8-bit Atari XE series and the 16-bit  Atari ST  line in  1985 . Then, in  1986 , Atari re-released the Atari 2600 and released its previously cancelled Atari 7800 console.  Atari rebounded, producing a $25 million profit that year. The Atari ST line proved moderately successful, ultimately selling more than 4 million units. It was especially popular among musicians, as it had built in MIDI ports. Still, its closest competitor in the marketplace, the  Amiga , outsold it 1.5 to 1. Atari eventually released a line of inexpensive  IBM PC compatibles  as well.  Atari also released Atari Lynx, a handheld console with color graphics, in  1989  to critical acclaim. However, a shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season and as a result, the Lynx lost marketshare to Nintendo's  Game Boy , which had only a black and white display but was widely available. Also in 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly. Atari lost.  As the fortunes of Atari's ST and PC compatible computers faded, consoles and software again became the company's main focus. In  1993 , Atari released its last console, the Jaguar. After a period of initial success, it, too, failed to meet expectations. Although it was more powerful than competing consoles from the likes of  Sony  and  Sega  in some ways, it was also more expensive and more difficult to program. Atari's competitors offered larger software libraries and advertised much more heavily.  By  1996 , a series of successful lawsuits followed by profitable investments had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank, but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari without any products to sell. In addition, Tramiel and his family wanted out. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. In July 1996, Atari merged with  JTS Corporation , a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, and the Atari name largely disappeared from the market. In March  1998 , JTS sold the Atari name and assets to  Hasbro Interactive  for $5 million, less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. The brand name changed hands again in December  2000  when French software publisher  Infogrames  took over Hasbro Interactive.  In October  2001 ,  Infogrames  announced that it was ""reinventing"" the Atari brand with the launch of three new games. On  May 7 ,  2003 , Infogrames officially changed its name to  Atari, Inc.

Atari chose to design the 5200                              around technology used in their popular Atari 400/800                              8-bit computer line, but was not directly compatible,                              unlike Atari's much later pastel-colored XEGS (XE                              Game System) console. The similarities in hardware                              did allow for relatively easy game conversions between                              the two systems, however, particularly when porting                              from the computer line to the 5200.                                                         The                              Atari 5200, as designed, was more powerful than Mattel's                              Intellivision and roughly equivalent to Coleco's ColecoVision,                              both of which were the 2600's main competition at                              the time and the systems Atari had to target in order                              to remain technologically competitive in the console                              marketplace. Besides the unusually large size of the                              5200 console, the controversial automatic RF switch                              box (incompatible with many televisions of the day                              without the included adapter) that also supplied power                              to the system and the innovation of four controller                              ports (the Atari 800 computer also featured four controller                              ports), the most notable feature of the system was                              the inclusion of analog joysticks, which to the frustration                              of most gamers were fragile and did not self center                              (or as ""The Game Doctor"", Bill Kunkel, put                              it, ""dead fish floppo""), but had a keypad                              that accepted overlays and featured one of the first                              pause buttons. Part of the 5200's girth accommodated                              storage for these controllers to the rear of the console,                              as well as a wire wrap underneath.                                                            Atari                              5200                             Alienating                              a significant number of Atari 2600 users, the Atari                              5200 was not backwards compatible with the popular                              system, requiring the purchase of all new software.                              With a lackluster initial game line-up, featuring                              cartridges with versions of software like ""Pac-Man"",                              ""Space Invaders"" and ""Breakout""                              that were already available on other systems, there                              was little incentive for many consumers to not consider                              the competition when upgrading consoles. With the                              poorly designed controllers, the few games that were                              otherwise impressive technically were difficult to                              control. For games actually designed around the non-centering                              analog joysticks, like Atari's own ""Countermeasure""                              or ""Space Dungeon"", the system fared much                              better, but unfortunately these types of games were                              few and far between.                                                          Realizing                              some of their mistakes, Atari released a smaller,                              two controller port Atari 5200 with a standard television                              switch box and independent power supply. In addition,                              the company released an Atari 2600 cartridge adapter                              to directly address an advantage that Mattel and Coleco                              had for their systems. Unfortunately, this add-on                              did not work with most of the 4-port 5200 models without                              significant modifications to the consoles themselves.                                                         Despite                              all of these set-backs, the Atari 5200 had a slow,                              but steady user growth cycle. Other hardware, like                              the trak-ball, was well designed and received good                              overall software support. The joystick holders that                              came with certain games, like ""Robotron: 2084"",                              were appreciated by hardcore gamers for allowing arcade                              authentic simultaneous use of two joysticks. Third                              party software support was fairly limited, but there                              were many games in development right up to early 1984.                              Unfortunately, by 1984, the console game market as                              a whole was mired in the throes of the infamous videogame                              crash, which left no mainstream console survivors                              or software support.                                                                                         Atari 5200 Trak-Ball                                                                                                                   After                              the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) revived the                              console industry beginning in late 1985, in 1986,                              Atari chose to re-release a smaller Atari 2600 system                              and resurrect the fully 2600 compatible Atari 7800,                              which was in development in the latter stages of the                              Atari 5200's short life cycle. While slightly more                              advanced than the Atari 5200 in the areas of graphics                              and overall system capabilities, it was a more traditional                              design and featured an inferior sound processor. In                              late 1987, Atari released the Atari XEGS, (named after                              Atari's then current XE 8-bit computer line, the successors                              to the popular XL series, which superseded the original                              400/800 systems) a console-centric Atari 8-bit computer,                              attempting to fulfill the 5200's unrealized potential                              years too late.                                                         Today,                              there is a thriving Atari 5200 hobbyist community,                              second only to the Atari 2600's, still creating new                              games. Because of the 5200's relatively swift demise,                              there are also an unusually high number of prototypes,                              many of which have been made available. For the modern                              collector, the hardware units themselves are relatively                              easy to find, but the fragile controllers in good                              working order are not. Further complicating matters,                              the cheap controller contacts require regular cleaning,                              as they corrode whether the joysticks are used a lot                              or simply put in storage and not used at all. The                              usual fix is to open the controllers and clean the                              contacts with a pencil eraser, removing what looks                              like black dirt (the corrosion). Obviously, this type                              of cleaning can only be done a finite number of times                              before certain controller elements completely wear                              out or fail from the repeated maintenance. There were                              rumors that if the videogame crash hadn't taken place                              when it did, Atari was going to release a new generation                              of self-centering 5200 controllers. Instead, third                              party joystick solutions, including ""y""                              adapters for regular Atari joysticks, as well as the                              first party trak-ball unit, were released, but are                              now difficult to locate. Repair kits, refurbished                              joysticks and adapters for other controller types                              are readily available, but tend to be a hassle for                              those without a serious dedication to the system.                                                         What                              one is left with when examining the life of the Atari                              5200 SuperSystem, is a look at a relatively powerful                              game console with an interesting, if somewhat small                              software library, and one of the overall worst default                              mainstream controllers in the history of electronic                              gaming, from a company that should have known better.                                                         The                              aforementioned Atari 7800 ProSystem was originally                              scheduled for launch in late 1984 as the follow-up                              to the misguided 5200, but didn't see a full release                              until 1986 in the US. Instead of competing with comparatively                              weaker systems like the 5200 and ColecoVision, the                              later release date for the 7800 brought direct competition                              from the more robust NES, released in late 1985, and                              the Sega Master System (SMS), which, like the ProSystem,                              was released in 1986.                                                         In                              late 1984, despite having had successful showings                              at trade events, an extensive and enthusiastic preview                              in one of the top video and computer game magazines                              of the day (Electronic Games), retail orders already                              taken, and warehouses full of stock, Atari management                              decided to shelve the system and its launch games                              in favor of their computer line when it became apparent                              to them - and seemingly everyone else in the industry                              - that the videogame depression had become an irreversible                              crash. Also put on the shelf was a redesigned 2600,                              dubbed the Atari 2600jr due to its diminutive size.                              These moves have often been criticized in hindsight,                              but for those around at the time, it was clear that                              videogames were being supplanted by low cost and powerful                              personal computers as the more flexible game machines                              of choice, and a game system in the traditional sense                              simply wouldn't be financially sustainable.                                                         All                              this changed in 1985, however, when Nintendo test                              marketed their successful Japanese game system in                              America, the Famicom (short for Family Computer),                              as the redesigned NES. Interestingly, Nintendo originally                              approached Atari in early 1984 about marketing and                              distributing the Famicom in America, but many factors,                              including management changes and the rapid decline                              of the videogame industry, led Atari to pass on the                              opportunity and force Nintendo to partner with Worlds                              of Wonder (the makers of ""Teddy Ruxpin""                              and ""Laser Tag""), and eventually go it alone.                              With a full product roll-out and clever marketing,                              by 1986, Nintendo caught the buying public's fancy                              and rejuvenated the videogame market. Atari, and soon                              Sega, took notice of Nintendo's success and quickly                              released systems of their own to try and capitalize                              on Nintendo's momentum.                                                                                                                      Atari 7800                                                                                       Atari,                              with no real interest or time to develop new technology,                              decided to take the Atari 7800 and its existing warehoused                              software and release the system as-is. Unlike the                              NES, which was seemingly full of new ideas, the 7800's                              deployment strategy was straight out of 1984, as were                              the initial games. The cartridge included with the                              7800 system, Pole Position II, looked primitive and                              simple in comparison to one of the NES' included titles,                              the now legendary Super Mario Bros. Surprisingly,                              around the same time, Atari also released the 2600jr                              for $50 (USA), supposedly as the system for gamers                              on a budget, despite the fact that the 7800 was fully                              backwards compatible, with the ability to utilize                              nearly all existing 2600 software and peripherals.                              Finally, there were even a few releases of remaining                              stocks of 5200 software, including titles that didn't                              make it out during the system's short prime, like                              ""Gremlins"".                                                         With                              lack of an innovative initial line-up of games, retailer                              indifference, absence of any real third-party software                              support due to Nintendo's infamous contracts, and                              lackluster marketing, the 7800, despite eventually                              selling a few million systems, never really caught                              on. To further add confusion to Atari's renewed videogame                              initiatives, a third system (not counting the abandoned                              5200), the XEGS, a console-centric Atari 8-bit computer,                              was released in late 1987, complete with keyboard                              and an Atari 2600/7800 compatible light gun, bringing                              the company full circle to their original vision with                              the failed 5200, but further removing company and                              development resources from the 7800.                                                          As described earlier, the Atari 7800 came bundled                              with a Pole Position II cartridge and one controller-a                              digital joystick with two side buttons similar in                              shape to the Atari 5200's analog controllers, but                              having no keypad. Atari kept the design simple, which                              had worked well for the Atari 2600's controllers,                              but the build quality was not as high, and some found                              it uncomfortable. The 7800's single joystick controller                              contrasted sharply with the then revolutionary NES                              and SMS gamepad designs, but, for the European release                              of the ProSystem, Atari instead packaged two of their                              own interpretations of a gamepad in with the system,                              as well as built ""Asteroids"" directly into                              the console's memory. Unfortunately, the original                              configuration in North America remained the same in                              that region throughout the rest of the system's production                              cycle. In fact, the NES, and eventually the SMS, were                              available in various interesting boxed configurations,                              including those with light guns and various other                              peripherals, while Atari never came out with anything                              comparable for the 7800, eventually only going as                              far as releasing a few compatible games for use with                              the XEGS light gun. Ironically, Atari had plenty of                              exciting peripherals either developed or in development,                              such as a keyboard add-on and high score cartridge,                              but Atari's management decided each time to pass on                              a release.                             As                              mentioned earlier, one of the major criticisms - perhaps                              unfairly - of Atari's 5200 when first released, was                              that it wasn't backwards compatible with the most                              popular system of the day, their own 2600. Atari rectified                              this situation by designing the Atari 7800 from a                              base of 2600 technology, providing almost perfect                              backwards compatibility, with the few inconsistencies                              due to several minor 7800 production revisions over                              the years. A type of encryption key was used to determine                              whether software should run in the system's 7800 or                              2600 modes, and also acted as a way to ensure only                              authorized software ran on the system, something not                              possible on prior Atari consoles. While Atari, unfortunately,                              did not update the 7800's base sound capabilities                              beyond the 2600's level, there was an ability to add                              a custom sound chip - the Atari 5200's excellent ""POKEY""                              - internally to a cartridge to enhance audio, usable                              either by itself or in conjunction with the built-in                              sound processor. Atari did update the graphics and                              other functions internally within the 7800 via several                              new chips, the most important of which was the ""MARIA"",                              which could allow over 100 objects on-screen at one                              time and provided for very stable, flicker-free images,                              particularly in comparison to the competition.                                                         Much                              the same as Atari's management refused to release                              any peripherals for the 7800, and split already limited                              company resources across two other consoles and several                              different computers, an executive decision was made                              to keep cartridge RAM (memory) sizes small to minimize                              costs. Unfortunately, this in turn limited how advanced                              games could become, creating unfavorable comparisons                              to both NES and SMS software, which were under no                              such restrictions. Worse, there were even rumors that                              Atari purposely downgraded certain Atari 7800 titles                              so as not to outshine their own XEGS. In spite of                              this, a few games did eventually get released that                              demonstrated the ProSystem's potential and created                              more favorable comparisons, albeit too late to make                              a difference in the hotly contested marketplace of                              the mid- to late-1980's. As for the 7800's outdated                              internal sound technology, only two games implemented                              the POKEY chip option, creating too few examples of                              the system's extended audio capabilities. In short,                              these limited uses of the system's power, combined                              with the fact that many Atari 2600 games were also                              labeled for use on the 7800, gave many the false impression                              that the system wasn't competitive.                                                         The                              7800 ProSystem's history, like many Atari consoles,                              is that of a system whose full potential was never                              realized. Atari's management was responsible for many                              of the system's implementation blunders, but ultimately,                              the 7800 was a victim of bad timing, first with the                              1984 videogame crash, and second going up against                              Nintendo and their eventual greater than 90% share                              of the videogame market, and all the industry influence                              that entails.                                                          While                              it will probably never have the sizable hobbyist communities                              of the 2600 or 5200, there nevertheless is a growing                              movement for new developments, which bodes well for                              collectors, as the system and a lot of its software                              is still fairly easy to locate on the used market.                              Despite some difficulty in finding original working                              two-button controllers, unlike the 5200, there are                              readily available third-party solutions, and many                              of the games use standard single-button 2600-style                              controllers anyway. This type of controller is always                              easy to find, and even most SMS and Sega Genesis/Megadrive                              controllers work for all single button games without                              modification.                                                                                          by                              Bill Loguidice                                                                                                                                                                                 A                              small selection of Atari controllers through the years.

The 5200 was created to compete with the  Intellivision , but wound up more directly competing with the  ColecoVision  shortly after its release. A number of design flaws had a serious impact on usability, and the system is generally considered to have performed poorly on the market.   The 5200 was heavily based on Atari Inc.'s existing  400/800  computers and the internal hardware was almost identical. However, a number of issues (aside from the lack of a keyboard) meant that software was not directly compatible between the two systems.           Contents       1   Hardware   2   Controllers   3   Internal differences between the 5200 and the 400/800   4   Market failure   5   Technical specifications   6   Launch titles   7   See also   8   References   9   External links               [ edit ]   Hardware   The system's Atari 400-based origins made for a powerful, proven design which Atari Inc. could quickly bring to market.   In its prototype stage, the Atari 5200 was originally called the ""Atari Video System X - Advanced Video Computer System"", and was codenamed ""Pam"" after a female employee at Atari Inc. It is also rumored that PAM actually stood for ""Personal Arcade Machine"", as the majority of games for the system ended up being arcade conversions. Actual working  Atari Video System X  machines, whose hardware is 100% identical to the Atari 5200 do exist, but they are extremely rare. [ 1 ]   The initial  1982  release of the system featured four controller ports, where nearly all other systems of the day had only two ports. The 5200 also featured a revolutionary new controller with an analog  joystick , numeric keypad, two fire buttons on both sides of the controller and game function keys for Start, Pause, and Reset. The 5200 also featured the innovation of the first automatic TV switchbox, allowing it to automatically switch from regular TV viewing to the game system signal when the system was activated. Previous RF adapters required the user to slide a switch on the adapter by hand. This unique  RF  box was also where the power supply connected in a unique dual power/television signal setup similar to the  RCA Studio II 's. A single cable coming out of the 5200 plugged into the switch box and was used for both electricity and the television signal.   The  1983  revision of the Atari 5200 has two controller ports instead of four, and a change back to the more conventional separate power supply and standard non-autoswitching RF switch. It also has changes in the cartridge port address lines to allow for the  Atari 2600  adapter released that year. While the adapter was only made to work on the two-port version, modifications can be made to the four-port to make it line-compatible. In fact, towards the end of the four-port model's production run, there were a limited number of consoles produced which included these modifications. These consoles can be identified by an asterisk in their serial number.     [ edit ]   Controllers   The controller prototypes used in the electrical development lab used a yoke and gimble mechanism that came from an RC airplane controller kit. This simple design gave very nice smooth linear control and was highly reliable. The production controllers were quite different and a great disappointment to the electrical and software development teams. The design of the  analog joystick , which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to provide centering, proved to be ungainly and unreliable. They ultimately alienated many [ who? ] consumers and quickly became the  Achilles' heel  of the system due to their combination of an overly complex mechanical design with a very low-cost internal flex circuit system. Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not translate into a linear acceleration from the center through the arc of the stick travel. This made control awkward. The controller also had a tendency to lockup. Fixing the lockup required the mechanics to be very loose fitting which gave the controller generally a sloppy feel. The controllers did, however, include a pause button, a novelty at the time that would become standard on almost all future game systems. Various third party replacement joysticks were also released.   Atari Inc. released the Pro-Line  Trak-Ball  controller for the system, which was almost as large as the 5200 itself.   A paddle controller [ 2 ]  and an updated self-centering version of the original controller [ 3 ]  were also in development, but never made it to market.     [ edit ]   Internal differences between the 5200 and the 400/800   Although the Atari 5200's internal design was extensively based on that of the 400/800 home computers, the differences were sufficient that games designed for one would not run directly on the other.   One of the most obvious was the 5200's lack of a  keyboard . However, there were several other differences:     The  400/800's 10 KB operating system  was replaced with a simpler 2  KB  BIOS, of which 1 KB is the built-in character set. [ 4 ]   A number of important registers, such as those of the  GTIA  and  POKEY  chips appear at different memory locations. [ 4 ]   The purpose of some registers changed slightly on the 5200. [ 4 ]   The 5200's analog joysticks required different input handling to the traditional digital joystick input on the 400/800. (However, the 5200 reassigned/rewired two of the 400/800's existing analog  paddle  registers for each bi-directional analog joystick input). [ 4 ]     Atari Corp.'s later  XE Games System  revisited the idea of a console based on the 400/800 hardware. However, as this was essentially just a 65XE computer with a detachable keyboard, it was able to run most of the home computer titles directly.     [ edit ]   Market failure   The Atari 5200 suffered from its software incompatibility with the  Atari 2600 , though an adapter was later released in 1983 allowing it to play all Atari 2600 games, using the more reliable controllers native to that system.   Another problem was the lack of attention that Atari Inc. gave to the console; most of its resources went to the already oversaturated Atari 2600. It faced an uphill battle competing with the ColecoVision's head start and a faltering economy and video game market.   At one point during the 5200's lifespan, Atari Inc. planned on developing a smaller cost-reduced version of the Atari 5200, which would have gotten rid of the controller storage bin. Code-named the ""Atari 5100"" (a.k.a. ""Atari 5200 Jr.""), only a few fully-working prototype Atari 5100s were made before the project was canceled.

Below are the results (ranked in order of their average gameplay scores).     In an attempt to eliminate skew, the high and low scores are dropped when a game receives enough ratings from contributors.     Only games that have been rated by at least three voters will be included in the poll.  Otherwise, the sampling error would simply be too large for reliable scores.

A ""5/4"" would stand for Gameplay=4 Graphics=5.   Asteroids       (KI) - It's no wonder Atari canned the game.  Sloppy isn't              a brutal enough description of the controls. (1/2)   Astro Chase       (TL) - I don't understand it.  What's the point?  Graphics are             good though. (score not given)   Ballblazer       (BW) - One of my all time favorites on any platform! (4/5)      (KI) - Split screen, first person perspective and two player             simultaneous gameplay.  Who could ask for anything more?             (4/5)   Battlezone (Prototype)       (DM) - How did they manage to make this game so bad?  Redefined             character sets made the tanks and obstacles unscalable,             and just made the whole thing look like a bad game you             typed-in on your own 8-bit from Antic magazine or             something. (3/1)      (KI) - No wonder this game was never released. (2/2)   Berzerk       (TL) - This cool game taught me how to fight like a robot             instead of chicken. (4/4)      (EB) - Best home version of this game.  Speech is cool! (4/4)   Black Belt       (KI) - A very early and unfinished fighting game.  Shows              promise but the lack of collision detection makes it              hard to judge the game.  (2/3)   Bounty Bob Strikes Back       (KHe)- All I can say is ""WOW!""  I thought Miner 2049er was great             (and it still is), but Bounty Bob is king!  This game is             incredibly fun AND challenging.  It takes the best             elements of Miner, then expands on them.  There is so             I like about this game: Lots-o-levels, tons of strategy,             humor, warps, and a special configuration page to boot.             Even the high score entry and display pages are great.             This game is a definite 5/5 for graphics/playability.             Thank you Bill Hogue! (5/5)      (DER)- Game play is really different.  Takes all the fun of             Miner 2049er out, sometimes it's hard to tell the             difference between the two except for the different             colors.  It's really difficult to jump from one level to             another.  I'll say it again; game play is really             difficult. (1/2)   Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom       (DER)- A game I like except I wish they would have taken it             further and made the graphics a bit better a la             Ballblazer.  A distant predecessor to games like 1942.             (4/3)   Centipede       (DM) - My 5/5 rating is really based on the fact that this is a             port, it's just a plain good 5200 version.  Smooth moving             enemies, fantastic sound, and the trak-ball makes this             probably one of my favorite 5200 titles. (5/5)      (KHe)- Gameplay improves when using trak-ball.      (EB) - Different from (and better than) the Atari 8-bit Computer             version. (4/3)      (JJ) - Beats Atari Computer version by a mile. (5/5)   Congo Bongo       (JT) - Hate this damn game.  Cheezy 3-D perspective doesn't work             at all. (1/2)      (DER)- It's an OK game.  I liked playing it in the arcade, but             the 5200 version is kinda lame.  The opening level seems             like a big splotch of yellow with some brown added to it.             (3/3)      (EB) - Awful, just awful. (1/2)   Countermeasure       (TL) - The 5200's version of Combat. (4/2)   Decathlon       (KI) - If you want to kill your joystick by playing this game,             be my guest.  Don't say that I didn't warn you, though.             Decent enough game for those who don't mind the risk of             thrashing their controllers. (2/4)   Defender       (DER)- I consider this game the ""feel-good"" game of the Atari             series.  It seems no matter how bad you are playing, you             can always rack up a high score.  I like Defender a lot,             it's one of my all-time faves. (5/3)      (TL) - Not a big fan of the game but the graphics are             outstanding! (3/5)      (KI) - Smooth gameplay coupled with the absence of flicker             (unlike the 2600 version) combine to make this one of             the most faithful ports of Defender on any classic             system. (4/4)   Dig Dug       (DER)- I've seen better ports of this than the 5200 version, but             there's something about Dig Dug I like that I can't put a             finger on.  An entertaining game. (3/3)   Final Legacy       (KI) - None of the sub-games is good enough to stand on its own,              but judged as a whole it's slightly more enjoyable than              Countermeasure. (3/4)   Frogger       (JT) - Friggin' retarded control scheme. (2/5)      (TL) - What a sissy concept for a game. (2/3)      (KHe)- Looks good, but button/joystick combo that you have to             use to control Frogger's movement is a pain.  Keypad             controlling is even worse. (2/4)      (KI) - Play this game with the Masterplay and you'll change your             mind, guys :) (4/4)   Frogger II: Threeedeep!       (DER)- I like this game a lot.  One of the last games I got             before they became impossible to get.  As a matter of             fact, this game IS impossible to get.  I like the             graphics and it's a big improvement over the first one.             (4/4)      (KI) - Great sequel, but this game is bound to frustrate even             the best gamers with its absurd difficulty. (4/4)   Galaxian       (BW) - Looks and plays like Galaxian, but just lacks something.             (4/3)      (DER)- This game is haunted by the fact that the game play and             screens never change. (See also Space Invaders).  I like             this better than Space Invaders, however. (3/3)   Gorf       (TL) - I can't give it a 5/5 because they forgot the Galaxian             level.  Otherwise it is awesome! (4/5)   Gyruss       (JT) - Fantastic music. (4/5)      (KI) - Along with Ballblazer, Pengo and Moon Patrol, this game             is a showcase title of the 5200's remarkable audio             capabilities. (4/3)   James Bond 007       (KI) - An insanely difficult game, and an awful one to boot. (2/3)   Joust       (KI) - A faithful home port of the Williams coin-op. (4/4)   Jungle Hunt       (KHe)- Is it just me or is the final scene much more difficult             than in the original coin-op? (3/4)      (KI) - Most people either love this game or despise it.  I'm             somewhere in between, however. (3/4)   K-Razy Shootout       (KI) - A decent ripoff of Berzerk on a system that already has             an (almost) pixel perfect port of the real thing. (3/2)   Kaboom!       (DM) - Although many people believe playing Kaboom! without a             paddle is some kind of sacrilege, I love this version of             the game.  With the 5200 joystick, you're simply             controlling the same potentiometer in the controller, but             with a knob on the 2600 and a stick on the 5200.  Output             is analog either way.  Plus, the 1812 Overture really             gets me pumped up! (5/4)      (KI) - The option of allowing a second player to play as the Mad             Bomber is a cool feature not found in any other version             of Kaboom! (4/3)   Kangaroo       (TL) - This game is downright stupid.  The graphics are even             worse.  I bet they had Commodore shaking in their boots             at the time. (1/1)      (KI) - Controlling Mama-roo is tricky with the standard 5200             joystick, but this game truly shines for those lucky             enough to have a third-party controller. (4/4)   Mario Bros.       (KHe)- Great port.  Fun, especially with two players. (5/4)   Megamania       (TL) - Cool graphics, but redundant as #@$%. (3/4)      (DM) - I love this game.  Apart from the fact that this game             just feels a little different from the 2600 version that             we're all used to, this game is terrific in every way.             And aside from the game, the label and box art are quite             superior to its 2600 counterpart.  If this one had come             out first, they would have laughed the 2600 version out             the door. (5/5)   Meteorites       (KI) - A pretty decent Asteroids clone.  Speaking of which,             whatever happened to Asteroids??? (4/3)   Micro-gammon SB (Prototype)       (DM) - I'm glad they used the highest resolution possible for at             least one game.  The computer may not be a very good             backgammon player, but they really had a great idea here             and I'm sorry it wasn't released. (3/5)   Millipede (Prototype)       (KI) - Absolutely phenomenal.  The trak-ball option puts this             version above the technically superior NES edition. (5/4)   Miner 2049er       (DER)- This game is everything that BBSB isn't.  Easy to play,             not too difficult, OK graphics, just a lot of fun. (4/2)      (KHe)- Great game!  Was my favorite as a kid. (5/5)   Missile Command       (TL) - This game has it all!  Easily my favorite 5200 game and             among my favorites of all time.  Anyone have a trak-ball             for sale? (5/5)      (DM) - With two buttons and a keypad available, having only one             missile base is inexcusable.  They even fit two bases             into the Atari ST version, using each button on the             mouse.  Why couldn't Atari port their own game worth a             ""bleep""? (2/3)   Mountain King       (KHe)- Fun; are the higher levels winnable? (5/3)   Mr. Do's Castle       (DM) - After seeing the Colecovision version, this is just plain             sad.  The 5200 could certainly have moved the Do-meister             and the Chameleon Unicorns around better than it did.             (3/2)   Ms. Pac-Man       (DER)- The successor to Pac-Man is more challenging than the             original, and gameplay is better. (4/3)   Pac-Man       (TL) - The screen is just too wide.  And what happened to the             great sound effects that were included in the 2600             version? (3/2)   Pengo       (KHe)- Fun!  I liked the arcade game, but wasn't too good at it.             Played this version a lot!  Great port (5/3)      (KI) - A pixel perfect port of the coin-op cult classic. (4/5)   Pitfall!       (BW) - I actually like 2600 Pitfall better! (3/3)   Pitfall II: Lost Caverns       (KI) - For an additional challenge, try the secret Adventurer's             world! (5/4)   Pole Position       (BW) - Made me want a 5200 back in the day (4/4)   Popeye       (TL) - Graphics leave a bit to be desired. (3/2)      (KI) - Never cared for Nintendo's coin-op version, so the 5200             one doesn't do much for me. (3/3)   Q*Bert       (JT) - Retarded controls (like Frogger). (2/4)      (KHe)- Not one of my favorite games, but seems to be a good             port.  Of course, it's missing the ""thwack"" of the              original when Q*bert or Coily jumps off the side of the             pyramid. (3/3)   Qix       (TL) - A true classic.  Decent graphics.  Great concept!  One of             the best ever! (5/5)   RealSports Baseball       (DER)- This game is fun!  I like playing the higher levels,             because the easy level is too easy.  On the easy level,             you can bunt for home runs.  The voice in the game is             cool, but can get old after a long time of playing. (4/4)   RealSports Basketball (Prototype)       (DER)- I played this game for two weeks as part of an Atari             survey my Dad got in '83 in the Northwest suburbs of             Chicago.  The graphics were terrible and the gameplay             wasn't too much better.  I suppose it would have been             better if I had really good joysticks, or that I should             have played it on the two-port version. (2/2)   RealSports Football       (DER)- This game is just above average.  The playbooks are cool,             but I can run the same play over and over again and             demolish the computer.  I don't understand how a player             can run around the screen and end up on the other side.             (2/2)   RealSports Soccer       (DER)- I'm a big fan of Soccer, and this game is an OK version.             It seems that most of the time the other players are out             just wandering around. (3/2)   Rescue on Fractalus!       (KI) - The system of fractile geometry which was used to              generate the planetary landscape was a gaming first.              (5/5)   River Raid       (BW) - I don't like the jagged river edges, and the stick ruins             it for me. (4/3)   Space Dungeon       (TL) - Berzerk in outer space with a little more meat in it.             (4/4)      (JJ) - Simply put, this game rules! (5/5)      (KI) - Robotron meets Berzerk meets Zelda.  A closet classic             that begs to be played by everyone. (5/5)   Space Invaders       (DER)- I know it's an older game, but Galaxian and Megamania             picked up where this one left off.  Gameplay is OK and             graphics are weak, but that's what it's like to be an             original. (2/2)      (KHe)- Not really like the original but kind of fun.  The mother             ship comes out constantly! (3/3)   Star Raiders       (BW) - Great, even with the 5200 stick! (5/5)      (DER)- Predecessor to X-Wing and Wing Commander.  Really             involved for a 5200 game.  It had one of the largest             manuals for any game, 40-some pages. (5/3)      (KHe)- I guess this is considered to be a ""classic,"" but I just             can't get into this game.  Yuck! (1/1)   Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator       (EB) - Boring translation of a game that has no good home ports             (vector to raster). (2/3)   Star Wars: The Arcade Game       (DM) - After this guy got fired from Atari for Battlezone, he             must have went to Parker Brothers.  Same crappy blocky             Battlezone graphics ruined this one too. (3/2)      (KI) - It (sort of) looks like the arcade version, and it sure             sounds like it, too.  But it plays nothing like its             color vector parent. (2/3)   Super Breakout       (KHo)- The 2600 version blows this one out of the water! (1/1)      (BW) - How do you rate graphics on Breakout?  Of course they're             blocky. (3/4)   Super Pac-Man       (KI) - Absolutely superb.  The graphics are sharp and colorful,              and everything that was found in the coin-op original is              featured in the SuperSystem adaptation. (5/5)   Tempest       (KI) - Incomplete, but what's there shows tremendous promise.             Control is spot-on, and the sound effects seem to have              been taken straight out of the arcade version. (4/5)   Vanguard       (TL) - I liked the 2600 version better but credit is due for a             great game like Vanguard. (3/5)      (KHe)- Captures the spirit of the original.  Sadly, the four             fire button arrangement of the coin-op couldn't be             duplicated.  I hate how the ship doesn't move easily             while firing. (3/3)   Wizard of Wor       (TL) - Cool game.  Decent graphics. (4/4)   Xari Arena (Prototype)       (DM) - Good marks just based on originality.  What a nifty game             this was. (5/4)      (KI) - If you liked Warlords, you'll absolutely love this             prototype game. (4/3)   Zaxxon       (KHo)- Blows away the Colecovision and C-64 versions by a mile!             (5/5)   Zone Ranger       (TL) - Playability is awesome. (4/4)           Back to Table of Contents                "

Infogrames ) game software company.  The original company Atari was a pioneer in  arcade games , home  video game consoles , and  personal computers , and its dominance in those areas made it  the  major force in the  computer  entertainment industry in the early to mid  1980s . The brand has also been used at various times by  Atari Games , a separate company split off in  1984 .  Although the original Atari ceased to exist in  1996 , a large amount of underground development remains for Atari's game systems and computers of the  1970s  and  1980s , and much of the Classic Gaming Expo's attention, which has existed since  1997 , focuses on Atari.  The name  Atari  (当たり) comes from the ancient board game  Go , where ""atari"" is a Japanese term that applies to moves which threaten to capture opponent's stones. It may be used during polite games as a courtesy to make one's opponent aware of the potential threat. It is similar to "" check "" in chess.  See  Atari .     [ Top ] History   Since the early days of coin operated machines, Atari has been responsible for home consoles such as the  Atari 2600  (VCS); produced a series of  eight-bit computers  (Atari 400 & 800); taken part in the 16 bit computer revolution with the  Atari ST ; made the revolutionary (for its time) 64-bit  Atari Jaguar ; and released a hand held video game console, the  Atari Lynx .  Founded in the United States in  1972  by  Nolan Bushnell , Atari could be credited with starting the video arcade industry with the seminal  Pong . The home version of Pong, which connected to a television set, was also the first of the  video game consoles .  Bushnell sold Atari to  Warner Communications  in  1976  for an estimated $28 million to $32 million. Bushnell departed from the division in  1978 . While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600 consoles, and at its peak, it accounted for one third of Warner's annual income and became the fastest-growing company in history in the United States (at the time). Although it had garnered the lion's share of the home video game market, the 2600 experienced its first stiff competition in  1980  from  Mattel's   Intellivision , which featured ads touting its superior graphics capabilities relative to the 2600. Still, the 2600 remained the industry standard-bearer, due to its market superiority, and due to Atari featuring (by far) the greatest variety of game titles available.  However, Atari ran into problems in the early 1980s. Its  home computer ,  video game console , and  arcade  divisions operated independently of one another and rarely cooperated. Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to follow on the success of the 2600. In  1982 , Atari released disappointing versions of two highly publicized games,  Pac-Man  and  E.T. , causing a pileup of unsold inventory and depressing prices. Also in 1982, Atari settled a court case with  Activision , officially opening the 2600 to third-party development. The market quickly became saturated, depressing prices further. In addition, in December 1982, Atari executives Ray Kassar and Dennis Groth were investigated for insider trading (later found to be false). The  Atari 5200  game console, released as a next-generation followup to the 2600, was based on the Atari 800 computer (but was incompatible with Atari 800 game cartridges), and its sales never met the company's expectations. Some time during the  1980s , it is rumored Atari buried millions of unsold E.T. game cartridges in a  New Mexico   desert   landfill .  Still, Atari held a formidable position in the world video game market. They were the number one console maker in every market except  Japan . That market belonged to  Nintendo , who had released their first game console, the  Famicom  (known to the rest of the world as the  NES ) in  1983 . The system took Japan by storm, and Nintendo began to look to other markets. They approached Atari and offered a licensing deal - Atari would build and sell the system, paying Nintendo a royalty. The deal was all but done, and the two companies decided to formally sign the agreement at the 1983 Summer CES. Unfortunately, at that same show  Coleco  was showing their new Adam computer, and the display unit was running  Donkey Kong . But Atari owned the rights to publish Donkey Kong for computers. Atari CEO Ray Kassar had a fit, accusing Nintendo of double dealing with the Donkey Kong license. Nintendo in turn tore into Coleco. In the coming month, Ray Kassar was forced to leave Atari, and executives involved in the Famicom deal were forced to start over again from scratch.   These problems were followed by the infamous  video game crash of 1983 , which caused losses that totaled more than $500 million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20 and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division. As for Nintendo, Atari could no longer afford the Famicom deal, and eventually Nintendo would be forced to go it alone.  In July  1984 , Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to  Jack Tramiel , the recently ousted founder of Atari competitor  Commodore International , under the name  Atari Corp.  for $240 million. Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name  Atari Games .  Under Tramiel's ownership,  Atari Corp.  abandoned the game console market to concentrate on aggressively priced home computers, releasing the 8-bit Atari XE series and the 16-bit  Atari ST  line in  1985 . Then, in  1986 , Atari re-released the Atari 2600 and released its previously cancelled Atari 7800 console.  Atari rebounded, producing a $25 million profit that year. The Atari ST line proved moderately successful, ultimately selling more than 4 million units. It was especially popular among musicians, as it had built in MIDI ports. Still, its closest competitor in the marketplace, the  Amiga , outsold it 1.5 to 1. Atari eventually released a line of inexpensive  IBM PC compatibles  as well.  Atari also released Atari Lynx, a handheld console with color graphics, in  1989  to critical acclaim. However, a shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season and as a result, the Lynx lost marketshare to Nintendo's  Game Boy , which had only a black and white display but was widely available. Also in 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly. Atari lost.  As the fortunes of Atari's ST and PC compatible computers faded, consoles and software again became the company's main focus. In  1993 , Atari released its last console, the Jaguar. After a period of initial success, it, too, failed to meet expectations. Although it was more powerful than competing consoles from the likes of  Sony  and  Sega  in some ways, it was also more expensive and more difficult to program. Atari's competitors offered larger software libraries and advertised much more heavily.  By  1996 , a series of successful lawsuits followed by profitable investments had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank, but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari without any products to sell. In addition, Tramiel and his family wanted out. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. In July 1996, Atari merged with  JTS Corporation , a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, and the Atari name largely disappeared from the market. In March  1998 , JTS sold the Atari name and assets to  Hasbro Interactive  for $5 million, less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. The brand name changed hands again in December  2000  when French software publisher  Infogrames  took over Hasbro Interactive.

clueweb09-enwp00-24-01436	"                     Atari Corporation          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Atari Corp. )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          For information on the Atari brand and its history , see  Atari .   Atari Corporation  was a manufacturer of computers and video game consoles from 1984 to 1996. Atari Corp. was founded in July 1984, Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to  Jack Tramiel , the then recently ousted founder of Atari competitor Commodore International, under the name Atari Corporation for $240 million in stocks under the new company.

In 1985, they released their update to the 8-bit computer line, the Atari XE series, as well as the 16-bit  Atari ST  line. Then, in 1986, Atari Corp. launched two consoles designed under the Warner Atari - Atari 2600jr and the  Atari 7800  console (which saw limited release in 1984). Atari Corp. rebounded, producing a $25 million profit that year. The Atari ST line proved very successful (but mostly in Europe, not the U.S.), ultimately selling more than 4 million units. It was especially popular among musicians, as it had built in  MIDI  ports. Still, its closest competitor in the marketplace, the  Commodore Amiga , outsold it 3 to 2. Atari eventually released a line of inexpensive  IBM PC compatibles  as well as an MS-DOS compatible palm computer called the Atari Portfolio.   In 1989, Atari Corp. also released the  Atari Lynx , a handheld console with color graphics, to critical acclaim. However, a shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season. As a result, the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo's  Game Boy , which had only a black and white display but was widely available. Also in 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly. Atari lost.   As the fortunes of Atari Corporation's ST and PC compatible computers faded, consoles and software again became the company's main focus. In 1993, Atari Corp. released its last console, the  Atari Jaguar . After a period of initial success, it, too, failed to meet expectations. It was not nearly as powerful as  Sony Computer Entertainment's   PlayStation  or  Sega's   Saturn  and lacked the extensive third party support its Japanese competitors had easily secured for their consoles.     [ edit ]   Atari Corp.'s reverse merger with JT Storage Inc.   By 1996, a series of successful lawsuits followed by profitable investments had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank, but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari without any products to sell. In addition, Tramiel and his family wanted out. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. In July 1996, Atari merged with  JTS Inc. ,a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, to form JTS Corp. [ 1 ]  Atari's role in the new company largely became a holder for the Atari properties and minor support, consequently the name largely disappeared from the market.   In March 1998, JTS sold the Atari name and assets to Hasbro Interactive for $5 millionless than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. This transaction primarily involved the  brand  and  intellectual property , which now fell under the Atari Interactive division of Hasbro Interactive. The brand name changed hands again in December 2000, when French software publisher  Infogrames  took over  Hasbro Interactive .

Do you have a extremely Hard Game?. You play and you play again, try and do what you can,  but you know that you can't win. What more can you do?. Don't worry, The Game Is Not Over. CHEAT THE GAME!!!  Typical effects of cheats: Invulnerablility: (""God mode"") Is a state wherein the player character is invulnerable to damage. A variation of this is ""Buddha mode"" where the player character gets damaged or hurt but cannot die (health stops decreasing when it reaches 1). Invisibility: In a video game causes enemies to not see the player character, in order to avoid being attacked by them, such as the ""notarget"" code in some first-person shooters. No-Clip or flying: Disables collision detection so the player character can pass through walls or objects, inheriting a rather ethereal quality to playing the game. Flying allows the player to move freely about in the game's space, even up and down, as if walking through air. Infinite resources: An infinite amount of some resource such as ammunition, lives, or money. Addition to weapons or inventory items: There are ways of editing a game save file to add certain useful items to your inventory or give your player more weapons. Save files can also be edited to place the player character in a different area in the game. Unlockable items and characters: Some cheats can unlock hidden items or unused content in the game. In beat 'em up games it is common for characters to be unlockable.  You are in the  FREE GAME CHEATS  section of iwantoplayfreegames, the most complete game cheat code website in the Net.

Pieces                     Five Million E.T. Pieces                             Claim:    Atari buried millions of unsold ""E.T."" cartridges in a New Mexico desert landfill.      Status:     True.       Origins:     In 1982, Warner Communications could honestly claim to own a goose that laid golden eggs.      Its money-producing fowl was called Atari, a video game company it purchased for  $28 million  in 1976  which had since burgeoned into a  $2  billion  concern.  In the early 1980s Atari owned 80% of the video game market, it accounted for 70% of Warner's operating profits, and in the fourth quarter of 1982 the Wall Street ""whisper number"" concerning Atari's expected earnings predicted a 50% increase over the previous year.   The goose died at  3:04 P.M. EST  on  7 December  1982, when Atari reported only a 10% to 15% increase in expected earnings, not the 50% figure so many people had been counting on.  By the end of the following day Warner stock had plummeted to two-thirds of  its previous value, and Warner closed out the quarter with its profits down a mind-boggling 56%.  (Even worse, a minor scandal erupted when it was revealed that Atari's president and CEO had sold 5,000 shares of Warner stock a mere  23 minutes  before announcing Atari's disappointing sales figures.)  Atari racked up over half a  billion  dollars  ($536 million)  in losses in 1983, and by the end of 1984 Warner had sold the company.   What accounted for the sudden death of Warner's prized goose?  A number of interrelated factors brought about its fatal illness:      Most of Atari's top programmers, disenchanted with the lack of respect, compensation, and freedom they were afforded under Warner management, left to work elsewhere.      Atari was selling its game consoles as cheaply as possible and expecting to make its profits from sales of game cartridges, but other companies such as Imagic and Activision (founded by some of the disenchanted Atari programmers mentioned above) cut into Atari's sales by creating their own cartridges for Atari consoles (and their games that were far superior to what Atari itself was producing).      Atari's VCS game console was several years old by 1982, and its established customer base was being eroded by newer, better systems such as Mattel's Intellivision and Coleco's ColecoVision (especially when those systems started offering adapters that allowed customers to play VCS game cartridges without needing to own Atari consoles).  Even worse, the ""next generation"" system Atari finally unveiled in late 1982 ,the  Atari 5200,  was a huge disappointment (in part because its joysticks were poorly designed and difficult to use, and because it was incompatible with the huge existing base of VCS cartridges).      Atari's home consumer division had garnered huge profits by producing home versions of popular arcade games created by its own  coin-op  division ( Asteroids ) or licensed from other manufacturers (Taito's  Space Invaders  and Namco's  Pacman ), but let the licensing of that year's smash arcade hit,  Donkey Kong,  slip away from them.  (The license for  Donkey Kong  was instead snapped up by Coleco, who probably could not have successfully launched its competing ColecoVision game system without it.)     The first signs of the goose's fatal illness came with Atari's  Pacman  cartridge.  Atari was so sure its home version of the world's most popular arcade game would reach new sales heights that it manufactured  12 million   Pacman  cartridges in 1982 (even though at the time only about  10 million  people owned and used Atari VCS consoles), counting on the game's popularity to spur additional sales of the VCS.  With most of Atari's best  in-house  programmers long since having fled the company, the result was an colossal disappointment.   Pacman 's animation was jerky, its moving images flickered annoyingly, and the Pacman character produced only a grating ""bong"" sound that was nothing like the arcade version's amusing sound effects.  Atari sold  7 million  copies of Pacman, but the poor quality of the game turned many people off, and Atari was still stuck with  5 million  unsold game cartridges.   If      one game cartridge could be selected as the symbol of the sudden demise of Atari's golden goose, however, it would have to be the ill-fated  E.T.   The head of Warner Communications made a deal with Steven Spielberg to produce a home video game version of Spielberg's blockbuster  E.T.  film. Basing a video game on a movie rather than an established arcade hit or a tested game premise (and expecting it to sell simply because of the popularity of the film) was a questionable enough decision, but the sheer awfulness of the finished product was unprecedented.  Atari rushed  E.T.  through development in a matter of months to get it onto the market in time for Christmas, and the result was a virtually unplayable game with a dull plot and crummy graphics in which frustrated players spent most of their time leading the E.T. character around in circles to prevent him from falling into pits.  Atari produced  5 million   E.T.  cartridges, and according to Atari's then-president and CEO, ""nearly all of them came back.""   In a bout of hubris at the end of 1981, Atari had told its distributors to place their orders for 1982 all at once.  The distributors,              anticipating another strong sales year, ordered aggressively, but when 1982 sales didn't meet expectations, those distributors were stuck with a lot of unsold Atari game cartridge inventory, which they returned to Atari in droves.  When distributor returns were added to the  5 million  unsold  Pacman  cartridges and another  5 million  useless  E.T.  cartridges, Atari found itself with tons of unsellable merchandise to dispose of, which led to the rumor that Atari buried millions of  E.T.  cartridges in a landfill in the  New Mexico  desert.   In this case the rumor was accurate, although it wasn't the first time Atari had destroyed cartridges, nor was  E.T.  the only game dumped in  New Mexico.  (Rumor had it that Atari's Borregas Street warehouse sat atop crushed and buried game cartridges as well.) Some other video game manufacturers attempted to rid themselves of excess inventory by selling it at sharply reduced prices, but Atari, stuck with millions of games and consoles that were largely unsellable at any price, sent fourteen truckloads of merchandise from their plant in  El Paso,  Texas, to be dumped in a city landfill in Alamogordo,  New Mexico  in late September 1983.  In order to keep the site from being looted, steamrollers crushed and flattened the games, and a concrete slab was poured over the remains.   Atari sent its goose away not with the traditional gold watch, but with a pair of cement overshoes.    Additional information:                  Atari's E.T.

clueweb09-en0000-09-10625	"          AGH Atari 8-Bit Computer Review: DONKEY KONG    by Atari            When  Donkey Kong  first debuted on the Colecovision,  it was believed to be the pinnacle of arcade-to-home translations.   With the Atari Home Computer version of the same game, Atari  essentially laughs in the face of those who believed the CV version  couldn't be topped.   The most striking difference is the speed -- no longer is Mario's climb such a tedious chore.  He scoots along the girders and up the ladders with ease, and you don't have to struggle to find the  bottoms  of those ladders.  Audiovisuals are also superior in every way.  The barrels roll down with fluidity with zero flicker, and Donkey Kong himself jumps up and down on the girders if you  don't start the game in a minute and 13 seconds.  Furthermore, the  girl now looks like she might almost be  worth  rescuing, and  she shouts, ""HELP!""           The Atari Computer version also has all four screens.  In comarison, the 2600 version had two and the NES and Colecovision three.  Yep,  Girders, Rivets, Elevators and Conveyer Belt screens are all there. There are five difficulty levels to test the skill of every gamer,  each of which can be played by one or two players.   While the Atari Computer cartridge version of Donkey Kong wasn't the most publicized home edition of Shigeru Miyamoto's classic, those who have experienced Atari's translation know that they're playing the best version available on a classic machine.

clueweb09-en0007-11-18665	"      ATARI HISTORY   By M. L. Clayton        1970   Nolan Bushnell began the design of a coin operated amusement game with a difference, it was video based.             1971   Nolan Bushnell sold the Computer Space coin-op to Nutting Associates.  1,500 units were produced of the space combat game based on Steve Russell's 1962 mainframe game Spacewar, but Computer Space failed to sell due in large part to the complex playing parameters.       Nolan Bushnell   founder of Atari      1972   Bushnell tried again with something a little simpler.  Al Alcorn wrote a video Ping-Pong game called Pong.  Bushnell wanted to sell this coin-op, but no company wanted it.  So with $500 he and Ted Dabney founded Atari Incorporated, the first real video coin-op company.  Bushnell wanted to name the company Sygyzy, but it was the name of an existing roofing company.  So he settled on the name Atari, a Japanese word from the board game GO, essentially meaning ""Checkmate"".        The first Pong coin-op was play tested in a bar named Andy Capps.  The bar keeper was not very interested in new electronic things, but Nolan persuaded him to install the machine.  Later the bar keeper phoned Bushnell telling him that the machine was defective.  When Bushnell came to remove the coin-op, he saw that there was indeed a problem.  There were too many coins in the coin box!  He removed the coins and the machine began working hard.   The Pong arcade game became a smash sensation. This was the beginning of a new era of entertainment.  Atari set up assembly facilities in a former roller skating rink, hired local hippies for labor, then began manufacturing Pong coin-ops for mass distribution.             1973   Pong was an unprecedented success.  Approximately 9,000 units were made, more than three times the number of a typical pinball machine at the time.  However Ted Dabney panicked about the competition.  Bushnell bought Dabney's half of Atari.   Bushnell formed Kee Games (named after and managed by friend Joe Keenan) to provide ""competition"" for Atari. The presence of two game companies allowed Bushnell to circumvent the existing distributor exclusivity networks and sell more games as a result.  Atari reaped $3.2 million in earnings for the year.               1974   Atari created a new video game every six weeks just to cover expenses.   Assembly line employees, disgruntled at low pay, began stealing game components and selling them to competitors.  Kee Games, at the height of its success, released Tank, invented by Steve Bristow.  It became a major success, and the distributor exclusivity networks were dissolved as dealers insisted on getting it.   Atari ""merged"" with Kee Games, and published Tank under its own label.   Joe Keenan was made President of Atari.   Al Alcorn created Home Pong, a dedicated home console to play Pong.       Super PONG Video Game   a refinement with more options      1975   Nolan Bushnell demonstrated Home Pong at a toy industry show.  It was Atari's first public display of a home console.  Sears Roebuck & Co. signed on as an exclusive distributor for Home Pong (under the Tele-Games label).  Sears agrees to provide money, advertising, and distribution for the console, in return for exclusive rights.   Home Pong was a major success, selling 150,000 units.   Atari reaches $40 million in sales, $3 million in profits.       Sears Tele-Games PONG   same thing different label      1976   Squeezed in arcades by larger pinball companies, Atari began development of pinball machines.  Atari bought Grass Valley, a local think tank, and incorporated it into its Research and Development staff.   In response to Fairchild's  Channel F  programmable home video game console (Which was released in 1975, and was truly the worlds first video game console accepting game cartridges and the weirdest joysticks.),  Atari began to develop ""Stella,"" a prototype console that accepted cartridges, under the supervision of  Jay Miner .   Nolan Bushnell hired Steve Jobs to create Breakout, a PONG variant.  Jobs joined with Steve Wozniak and designed the game in five days.  Bushnell pays Jobs $5,000; Jobs pays $350 to Wozniak, and took sole credit for Breakout.   Seeking funds to finish Stella for manufacturing, Nolan Bushnell sold Atari Inc. to Warner Communications for $28 million.  Bushnell was named Chairman of the Board, and Joe Keenan remained as President.     Jobs & Wozniak while still working at Atari, designed and built (with Atari components)  the original Apple computer .   Atari management, when shown the computer was not interested in the device.  The Steves moved on and started the  Apple Computer Company .             1977   After Warner Communications had invested $100 million in Atari Inc. to develop Stella, the project was unveiled as ATARI Video Computer System (VCS), with a suggested retail price of $200.  The console shipped with two joysticks, an RF TV adapter and the ""Combat"" game cartridge.  Simultaneously released were nine other games which were home versions of Atari's popular arcade titles.       The Video Computer System   fun, fun, fun    Hand-held electronic games cut into the Christmas sales, but Atari Inc. survived with financial support from Warner Communications, although it was deep in debt.             1978   Warner Communications hired Ray ""The Czar"" Kassar as president of Atari's consumer division. Bushnell and Warner disagree over the direction to take Atari Inc., especially on the topic of whether to form a home computer division.  Bushnell arranges to be fired. Ray Kassar took over as CEO of Atari Inc.  Changes were immediate, focus shifted from development to marketing and sales.  R&D took deep cuts, discipline and security were strict.  A stifling atmosphere angered many employees, who quit.   Atari launches its home computer division.  The home video game console and home computer divisions are deliberately kept separate.   Atari releases Football for the arcades, the first commercial game to use a track-ball controller.             1979   Warner Communications realized that video games are selling beyond the Christmas shopping season.  Atari VCS games are then released and promoted all year round.   Atari premiered the Atari 400 ""Candy""       Atari 400    great computer with practically unusable keyboard    and Atari 800 ""Colleen"" home computers       Atari 800   indestructible workhorse to please the FCC    at the Winter CES.  Each machine had 4 (!!!!) controller (I/O !!!!) ports, which in theory allowed up to 8 simultaneous players when using the paddle controllers (knobbed potentiometers) used with the earlier PONG and variant games.   Atari quits the pinball business.   Taito's Space Invaders arrived in America.  Interest in video games skyrocketed.   Ray Kassar dismisses Atari's engineers as ""high-strung prima donnas,""  angering the remaining staff.   Atari released Lunar Lander for the arcades.  It was Atari's first game with vector graphics.   Atari released the Asteroids coin-op.  It becomes a major hit, eventually selling 70,000 units, and dethrones Space Invaders in arcades.   Atari sells 400,000 VCS consoles.   Gross income was marked at over $200 million, operating income at $19 million.             1980   The golden days for Atari Inc. which posted record sales and $2 billion profits that year.  Atari occupied 80 offices in Sunnyvale, California.  The VCS reigned as the most popular video gaming system.        Atari released Space Invaders for the Atari VCS, the first home license of an arcade game.  Atari released Adventure for the VCS, the first commercial game to include a hidden ""Easter Egg"" (credit for the programmer, Warren Robinett).   Activision was founded. Founded by four former Atari employees -- David Crane, Alan Miller, Bob Whitehead, and Larry Kaplan -- it became the first third party video game developer.  Atari sued Activision, alleging its founders with violating non-disclosure agreements.   Atari released the Battlezone coin-op.  It was the first arcade game from Atari to feature a first person view.  Atari eventually sells 75,000 units.   Atari's gross income was marked at $415 million, operating income at $77 million.  Atari forms one third of Warner Communication's total annual income and becomes the fastest growing company in the history of America.             1981   Atari released Asteroids for the VCS, the first game to use ""bank switching"" technology to double its ROM address space.  Atari released Tempest for the arcades, the first game with color vector graphics.  Atari announced Cosmos, a holographic game system, and a streamlined, wireless version of the VCS.  Both products were never released.   To avoid a shortfall of games and increase profits, Atari asked distributors to commit to ordering games for all of 1982.  Not wanting to be caught short, distributors placed huge orders for the next year.       Cassette drives were common   the official Atari joysticks broke way too easily    Atari's annual sales were $35 million.  Peripherals and software were in demand.   Atari home computers were enhanced with the GTIA graphics chip, enabling more colors and additional screen resolutions.   IBM entered the personal computer market.  Initially they wanted to buy a company, and were very interested in Atari.  That was not to be.  But if it had happened think about the possibilities.   In 1981 IBM buys ATARI, the ATARI Computers are the IBM PC.   IBM gets the OS from Digital Research (GEM, Graphic Environment Manager), no Microsoft involved, IBM the first computer with a GUI, no ""Macintosh revolution"".  Recent history would be very different.             1982   Atari licensed Pac-Man from Namco, and announced plans to release a version for the Atari VCS.  Wall Street analysts predicted $200 million in sales.   Atari won its lawsuit against Magnavox for its K.C. Munchkin video game, a copy of Pac-Man.   Atari released Pac-Man for the Atari VCS.  Poor game play, bad graphics, and crappy sound crippled Atari's credibility.   Atari settled a lawsuit from Activision, and allowed the development of third party video games in return for royalties.  Dozens of companies began making games for the Atari VCS.   Atari's upper management suffered severe turnover rates.  Ray Kassar's autocratic management style was blamed, but Kassar was not held accountable.   Atari released E.T. for the Atari VCS.  Confusing game play and bad design further disillusioned the public on Atari.  Game sales plummeted and Atari's reputation was diminished further.  Distributors were stuck with excess games due to their commitments from the previous year.   Atari released Earthworld for the Atari VCS, the first title in a planned four part adventure series, along with an accompanying contest.  The series was never completed.       Atari 1200XL   incredibly incompatible with 800    Atari released the Atari 1200XL home computer.  Incompatibility problems causes the public to rush out and buy Atari 400 and Atari 800 computers before they're discontinued.   December 7 (Pearl Harbor Day), 2:41 p.m. EST -  Ray Kassar sells 5,000 shares of Warner stock, with a net worth of $250,000 and a profit of $81,000.   December 7, 3:04 p.m. EST - Warner Communications reports a 10% increase in earnings from the fourth quarter.  Lower Atari sales -- due to unsold games and increased competition -- are blamed. Stock analysts, previously promised a 50% earnings increase, are enraged.   December 8 - Warner's stock drops 33% in one day. Warner closes the quarter with profits down 56%.  Dealers cancel orders en masse. Warner's stock drops another 7% the next day.   December 14 - CEO Ray Kassar and vice-president Dennis Groth are investigated for insider trading.  Wall Street investors shy away from Atari and Warner.   Under pressure from the Mattel Intellivision and the Colecovision, Atari released the Atari 5200 (and renamed the Atari VCS to the Atari 2600).       Atari 5200    funky analog joysticks    Though the 5200 was essentially an Atari 400 computer in a new case, inter division rivalry caused the 5200 to be incompatible with the Atari 400 computer.   Atari's annual sales reached $203 million, but profits were low.   Rumors of a video game market crash began.             1983   Atari licensed Pac-Man from Namco.   A decline of video game sales combined with irresponsible spending by Atari Inc., resulted in record losses of $536 million.   Sales of the Atari 5200 were lower than expected.  Because it was incompatible with the Atari 2600, many consumers decided to buy the Mattel Intellivision or the Colecovision instead.   Atari announced My First Computer, a keyboard/computer attachment to the Atari 2600, along with peripherals and software.  It was never released.   Atari announced plans for the formation of Ataritel, a division to develop integrated computer/phone/video systems.   Atari layed off 600 employees and moved its manufacturing facilities to Hong Kong and Taiwan.  Atari closed its El Paso manufacturing plant.  Fourteen trailer trucks filled with unsold games were dumped in an Alamorgordo, New Mexico landfill and buried in concrete.  Atari claimed the games were defective.   Warner reported second quarter losses of $283.4 million, the worst quarter in the company's history.   The market for Atari VCS games became over saturated.  New games were dumped on the market at unprofitable prices, which cut into the sales of other titles and prevented new games from being developed.   CEO Ray Kassar resigned over mounting allegations of illegal insider trading activity.  The Securities and Exchange Commission accuse Kassar of trading stock with illegal insider knowledge.  Kassar settled, returning his profits without acknowledging guilt or innocence.   James Morgan was named CEO of Atari Inc.   Atari announced the formation of AtariSoft, a division to make games for competing video game and computer systems.   Atari replaced the 400/800/1200XL line of home computers  with the slightly redesigned but cheaper to manufacture 600XL and 800XL.   Atari posted losses of $536 million.       Atari 800XL   decent design about a year too late      1984   Commodore Business Machines Inc. (CBM) fired president and founder Jack Tramiel.   Warner Communications divided Atari Incorporated into 2 divisions.   CEO James Morgan announced that henceforth Atari will only announce new products that can be delivered in three months' time.   Atari announced plans to release the Atari 7800, a game console for $140.  Peripherals and games are also announced.   Rumors circulated that Warner Communications was looking to sell Atari Inc.   Atari announced the Mindlink, a ""mind control"" peripheral for the Atari VCS, and killed the Atari 5200.   Jack Tramiel bought Atari Inc.'s home computer and home video game division.  The new company was called Atari Corporation.  The Tramiel clan owned 51% of Atari Corp. stock, 25% was kept by Warner Communications, with the remaining 24% offered to the public.  Atari Inc.'s arcade division was retained by Warner Communications and renamed Atari Games.   Jack Tramiel fired over one thousand Atari Corp. employees, including CEO James Morgan.  Jack Tramiel was elected as CEO of Atari Corp., and his son Sam Tramiel became president.  Atari Corp. restructured again, and moved most operations overseas.   For the first time ever, Atari Corp. skips the summer Consumer Electronics Show.  The Ataritel project was canceled.   Nintendo of Japan had seriously considered selling its Famicom video game console in America.  Nintendo floated the idea of having Atari sell Famicoms under the Atari label.  Jack Tramiel rejected the offer, as it was not in line with his plans to remake Atari into a ""legitimate"" computer company, and they did not like the alien Nintendo joystick less controllers.  Also Atari was also giving money to a little company called AMIGA (owned by Jay Miner), who was busily creating a next generation 16-bit game console.   Atari Corp. tried to license the Amiga home computer system. CBM interceded with a much better offer and bought Amiga whole.   Atari Corp. announced plans to produce inexpensive 8-bit computers, along with new 16-bit and 32-bit home computers to compete with the IBM PC and Apple Macintosh.  Atari eventually licensed the GEM computer operating system from Digital Equipment Corporation for use in its next generation Atari PC.   The VCS 7800 was ready but not released.             1985   Shivy, the chief designer of the Commodore 64, was at Atari and was chief designer of the new 16-bit (Motorola 689000 CPU) color computer, the 520ST (a.k.a. the Jackintosh).       Atari 520ST   almost but no cookie    Atari Corp. released the 520ST just a few weeks before rival Commodore's fabulous  Amiga  1000 system.  Atari also produced CDROM drives for the ST.  It was the first personal computer with a designed CD-ROM peripheral, many years before the Wintel computer.   The 65XE and the 130XE, last of the 8-bit Atari series, were released.   Financial difficulties forced Atari Corp. to lay off more employees.  Remaining staffers took pay cuts up to 20%.   Nintendo released the Famicom as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), and quickly dominated the American home video game market.             1986   Atari Corp. (re)displayed the Atari VCS, the 7800, and home computers at the winter Consumer Electronics Show.       Atari 7800   very well designed but released 2 years after its completion, way too late    Atari Corp. released the Atari 7800 console, with just three games: Joust, Ms. Pac-Man, and Asteroids Deluxe.  This machine was generally well received.  Three additional titles were quickly released, but then later titles slipped in release, which prompted suspicion and criticism.   The 1040ST was shipped, the first PC with 1 MB of RAM for less than $1000.  ""Power without the Price"" was the motto.             1987   The Mega ST was released. There were versions with 1, 2, and 4 megabytes of ram.  They were targeted for desktop publishing use.   Atari Games created the consumer division, known as Tengen.       Atari XEGS   nothing new here    Atari Corp. announced the XE Game System (XEGS), a home console version of the Atari 65XE computer.   Critics immediately attacked the system and Atari for recycling games and hardware from five and six years past.   Atari Corp. announced more games for the Atari VCS, most of which are re-releases of earlier games from third party developers.  Critics roundly denounced the move.   Atari Corp. acquired Federated Electronics, a chain of retail electronics stores in California.   Atari announced combined VCS, 7800, and XEGS console sales of 1.5 million units.             1988   The ATW800, Atari's Transputer Workstation was shown.   Atari Corp. announced the signing of Nolan Bushnell to develop games for the Atari VCS, along with plans to release 45 titles for the company's three game consoles.   Atari Games/Tengen sued Nintendo over Nintendo's clauses for third party game development.   Tengen also announced the discovery of a way to create NES-compatible games that bypassed Nintendo's lock-out circuitry.             1989   The Atari 1040STE, an enhanced version of the 1040 was released.  The Atari TT, Ataris first real 32-bit computer was released.  The Atari Portfolio, the first MS-DOS palmtop was released.   Atari Corp. filed a $250 million anti-monopoly lawsuit against Nintendo.  The courts found in favor of Nintendo.   Atari Games/Tengen and Nintendo released NES versions of Tetris.  Each company claimed they had the rights to the title.  The courts ruled in Nintendo's favor, and Tengen was ordered to stop selling its version.       Atari LYNX   great hardware, poor management    Atari Corp. announced the Portable Color Entertainment System, a hand-held color video game console for $149.   The machine, later released as the Lynx, was the world's first color hand-held video game system.  It had a suggested retail price of $180.  Delays and shortages caused it to be released in limited numbers in New York and Los Angeles.  Due to the shortage of Lynxes, Atari missed the Christmas shopping season.   Nintendo's dark gray on light gray Gameboy dominated the portable video game market.   Atari Corp. sold Federated Electronics.             1990   Atari Corp. released the Lynx nationwide, with five games.  Although it could link with other Lynxes, it was caught in a crossfire between the Nintendo Gameboy and the NEC TurboExpress.   Atari released the Mega STE and the ST Book.             1991   Atari Corp. announced a deal with Flight Video, to allow airline passengers to rent Lynx consoles during flights.   Atari Corp. reduced  the price of the Lynx to $149, and then began to sell the Lynx for $99 in a ""bare bones"" package.  Atari also released a smaller, lighter Lynx, and announced that Lynx sales have doubled from the previous year.   Rumors surfaced of an advanced 32-bit game console from Atari, code named ""Panther"".  Atari Corp. confirmed the existence of the Panther, but did not show it at the summer Consumer Electronics Show.   Atari Games/Tengen was ordered by a preliminary injunction to stop the sale of NES-compatable games.   Atari Corp. announced that work on the Panther was stopped,  and that work had begun on a 64-bit console called the ""Jaguar.""             1992   Mediagenic/Activision filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.   Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $160 million lost to monopolistic practices, citing Nintendo's 80% market share from 1986-1990 as evidence.  The jury found in favor of Nintendo.   Atari announced that the Jaguar, a 64-bit cartridge based console, will be released in the summer of 1993 with a suggested retail price of $150.   Atari released the Falcon, a DSP based multimedia computer.             1993   Atari Games was bought by Time-Warner.   Atari Corp. unveiled the Jaguar, the world's first 64-bit home video game system, to worldwide press coverage.  Atari announced that 50,000 units would be sold in New York, San Francisco, Paris, and London in October, with worldwide release slated in 1994.  The suggested retail price was announced to be $200.       Atari JAGUAR   nice tech but too much competition    Atari Corp. released the Jaguar in limited distribution for $250.  All available units were quickly bought, but critics questioned if Atari could support the console.   Atari Corp. sued Sega for patent infringements.             1994   Atari Games/Tengen and Nintendo settle various patent infringement lawsuits.  Tengen was re-admitted as a Nintendo licensee.   Warner Communications and Time Life Inc. merged to form Time-Warner.  The Atari Games operations were folded into the new Time-Warner Interactive.  TWI announced plans to incorporate Atari Corp.'s Jaguar technology into its arcade games.  The first ""CoJag"" game was eventually released as Area 51.   Atari Corp. released Tempest 2000 for the Jaguar.  The game quickly became a best seller, and eventually reached total sales of over 350,000 copies.   Atari Corp. discontinued support for the Lynx.   Atari Corp. announced plans to release a modem for the Jaguar. It was never released.   Atari Corp. and Sega settled the infringement lawsuit.  Sega paid Atari Corp. $50 million for patent rights, and bought 4.5 million shares of Atari Corp.'s stock, valued at $40 million.             1995   At the Electronics Entertainment Expo, Atari Corp. announced a joint venture with Virtuality and unveiled the Jaguar VR headset.  The only product of that venture ever released was Missile Command 3D.   Atari hired Ted Hoff.  Rumors of powerful leadership and prompt decisions soon followed.   Atari Corp. released the Jaguar CD-ROM player for $150.             1996   Time-Warner Interactive (Atari Games) was sold to WMS - Midway Games Inc., where Atari Games became a subsidiary.   Atari Corp. announced a reverse merger with JTS Corporation, a maker of computer disk drives.  Atari Corp. and JTS consummated the deal on July 31 1996.  JTS acquired Atari's $50 million, and the Tramiels were able to liquidate their holdings in Atari (per SEC Rule 144).  Atari Corp.'s operations were absorbed by JTS, Atari Corp. lived on for tax purposes, allowing for the licensing of game titles and patents.  Most of the remaining Atari employees were released.  The Atari Corp. was thereafter known as JTS Corp.             1997      The Atari Games logo gets a new look.  Kinda Star Trekkish.             1998   The JTS (Jack Tramiel Scams?) Corporation sold all of its Atari assets to Hasbro Interactive for $5 million in cash.       HASBRO/Atari   finally in strong hands?       1999   Hasbro announced that they have released all rights to the Jaguar into the public domain.  Independent hobbyists and developers are thus able to develop Jaguar games and peripherals without fear of legal repercussions from Hasbro.   At the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, Hasbro officially relaunched Atari as their home video game label, a subdivision of Hasbro Interactive.  Updated versions of classic Atari titles like Pong, Missile Command, Star Raiders, and other games for the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64 consoles were announced.

Atari Lynx             From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                                          Atari Lynx             Manufacturer   Atari       Type   Handheld game console       Generation   Third generation       First available   September 1989 [1]       CPU   MOS Technology 6502       Media   Cartridge       Online service   ComLynx  (17 player networking)       Units sold   2 million       Top-selling game   Road Blasters       The  Atari Lynx  was  Atari 's only  handheld game console , though it was the second handheld gaming device released (the first being the  handheld electronic game  Atari Touch Me). Atari had previously worked on several other handheld projects including the  Breakout  and  Space Invaders   handheld electronic games ,  Atari Cosmos  portable/tabletop console, and the Atari Atlantis. However, those projects were shut down during development - some just short of their intended commercial release.   The Lynx had the privilege of being the world's first handheld portable gaming system with a  color  LCD display. The system is also notable for its forward-looking features, advanced graphics, and  ambidextrous  layout. The  Lynx  was released in 1989, the same year as  Nintendo 's (monochromatic)  Game Boy .   However, the Atari Lynx failed to achieve the critical mass required to attract quality third party developers. In contrast, Nintendo's Game Boy had full support from game developers. Today, as with a lot of older consoles, there is still a small group of devoted fans, creating and selling games for the system. An emulator called  Handy  was released to play Lynx games on PCs in 2000.           Contents       1   Features   2   History   3   Drawbacks   4   Technical specifications   5   Comparative products   6   Trivia   7   See also   8   References   9   External links               The Atari Lynx had several innovative features including it being the first color handheld, with a backlit display, a switchable right-handed/left-handed (upside down) configuration, and the ability to network with up to 17 other units via its ""ComLynx"" system (though most games would network eight or fewer players). ComLynx was originally developed to run over infrared links (and was codenamed RedEye). [2]  This was changed to a cable-based networking system before the final release.   The Lynx was also the first gaming console with hardware support for zooming/distortion of  sprites , allowing fast  pseudo-3D  games with unrivaled quality at the time and a capacity for drawing filled polygons with limited CPU intervention.  Blue Lightning , an  After Burner  clone, was especially notable and featured in TV advertising for the console.   The games were originally meant to be loaded from  tape , but were later changed to load from ROM. The game data still needed to be copied from ROM to RAM before it could be used, so less memory was available and the games loaded slower than necessary. [1]       The system was developed by  Epyx  as the ""Handy."" Planning and design of the console was begun in 1986 and completed in 1987. [1]  Epyx first showed the  Handy  system at the Winter  Consumer Electronics Show  (CES) in January 1989. Facing financial problems, Epyx sought out partners. Atari and Epyx eventually agreed that Atari would handle production and marketing, Epyx would handle software development. Atari changed the internal speaker and removed the thumb-stick on the control pad before releasing it as the Lynx two years later, initially retailing in the US at US$189.95. Atari then showed the Lynx to the press at the Summer 1989 CES as the ""Portable Color Entertainment System"", which was changed to Lynx when actual consoles were distributed to resellers. [1]   However,  Nintendo 's new  Game Boy  was also introduced at the 1989 CES. At $109, it was 58% the price of the Lynx, without the color or custom chips. Nintendo had no problems supplying retailers with the Game Boy for the Christmas season while Atari only managed limited distribution of their Lynx by year's end.          Atari Lynx II       During 1990, the Lynx had moderate sales but Nintendo's Game Boy continued to gain market share. In 1991, Atari relaunched the Lynx with a new marketing campaign, new packaging, slightly improved hardware, and a new sleek look. The new system (referred within Atari as the ""Lynx II"") featured rubber hand grips and a clearer backlit color screen with a power save option (which turned off the LCD panel's backlighting). It also replaced the monaural headphone jack of the original Lynx with one wired for stereo. The new packaging made available the Lynx without accessories, dropping the price to $99. Although sales improved, Nintendo still dominated the handheld market.   As with the actual console units, the game cartridges themselves evolved over the first year of the console's release. The first generation of cartridges was flat, but were designed in such a way as to be stackable. This design proved to be the most difficult to remove from either generation of console, and so a second design was introduced. This style, called ""tabbed"" or ""ridged"", used the same basic design as the original cartridges, with the addition of two small tabs on the cartridge's underside to aid in removal. The first, flat style, could be stacked on top of the newer cartridges, but the newer cartridges could not be easily stacked on each other, nor were they stored easily. Thus a third style, the ""curved lip"" style was produced, and all official and third-party cartridges during the console's lifespan were released (or re-released) using this style. [3]   In May 1991,  Sega  launched its  Game Gear  portable gaming handheld. Also a color handheld, in comparison to the Lynx it had a higher cost, larger bulk, and lower battery life. However, the Game Gear was backed up by significantly more popular titles and consequently the market became dominated by Nintendo followed by Sega in a distant second and the Lynx in third.   In 1994, Atari shifted its focus away from the Lynx. As Nintendo's  Super Nintendo  and Sega's  Genesis  filled retailer's shelves, Atari refocused its efforts on its  Jaguar  console. A handful of games were released during this time, including  Battlezone 2000 . In 1996, Atari shut down its internal game development.   Telegames released a number of games in the second half of the 1990s, including a port of  Raiden , a platformer called  Fat Bobby , and an action sports game called Hyperdrome. At the end of the decade, Hasbro, the current owners of Atari at the time, released the rights to develop for the system to the public domain. Since then a number of independent developers released games into the new decade, like  Championship Rally ,  CyberVirus , and  Winter Games . Some of the late 90s/early 2000s games were under development by other companies at one time, but rights to the game programs and all of the existing code was bought and finished by other developers. [4]       Though technologically superior to the Game Boy, a number of factors thwarted success of the unit:     Nintendo's marketing muscle, domination of 3rd party developers, and quality first party game releases (particularly  Tetris ), ensured the Game Boy always enjoyed vastly superior software support.   Nintendo's clout with retailers gave plenty of shelf space for Game Boy. Atari struggled with getting retailers to sell Lynx.   The Lynx needed six batteries versus the four in the original Game Boy. The more powerful architecture of the Lynx, plus its backlit screen, would also drain a set of six AA batteries in less than four hours (five to six hours in the Lynx II).   The original Lynx was also physically large and cumbersome. Atari had followed the advice of focus groups who wanted a bigger unit because that gave them ""more"" for their money. [5]  While the system is considered comfortable to hold, its portability was limited, and proved to be much harder to carry around than the Game Boy (which easily fit in a large pocket).   The Lynx sold at a substantially higher price than the Game Boy, due to the cost of the screen and more elaborate custom chips.   The original Lynx had problems with its cartridge slot. A cartridge was easy to insert, but because of their design, were difficult to remove from the system. The Lynx II remedied this.   The developer's kit for the Lynx was expensive and required an Amiga computer (Atari's own ST computers could not be used). The two creators of the system,  RJ Mical  and Dave Needle, were also members of the  Amiga  design team and much to the frustration of Atari, the Amiga was used as the software development platform.

At the same time, the Game Gear was also plagued by similar problems that hurt the Lynx; higher price, shorter battery life, larger size and the Game Boy's dominance of the portable video game market.       The Lynx has made at least two appearances in the American TV show  Full House . In one episode, Michelle Tanner invites two snobby friends over to play. They sit on her bed and both pull out two Lynx consoles. Michelle asks if she can play, and they tell her she can when she gets her own console. The Lynx II appeared in a later episode, where Gena has a make-out party. Steph's ""make-out partner"" plays it right before Danny walks in.

A  test market  release had occurred two years earlier under  Atari Inc . The 7800 was designed to replace Atari Inc.'s unsuccessful  Atari 5200  and later to re-establish Atari Corp.'s market supremacy against  Nintendo  and  Sega . With this system, Atari Inc. addressed all the shortcomings of the Atari 5200: it had simple digital  joysticks ; it was almost fully  backward-compatible  with the  Atari 2600 ; and it was affordable (originally priced at  US$140 ).

The system had been designed in 1983 and 1984 with an intended mass market rollout at the end of 1984. The project was originally called the 3600 and then later renamed the 7800.   Several key factors influenced the design of the 7800. First, Atari had been facing mounting pressure from the  ColecoVision , which boasted graphics that more closely mirrored arcade games of the time than Ataris reigning 2600 VCS system. Second, the Atari 5200 (the original intended successor to the Atari 2600 VCS) had been widely criticized for not being able to play Atari 2600 VCS games and for the poor quality of its analog joysticks. Finally, dropping prices of home computers like the  Commodore 64  had caused many to believe that buying a home computer was a better investment because it provided more detailed game play and could be used for other purposes such as word processing.   Previous game consoles sometimes had a difficult time replicating the arcade experience in home versions of popular  arcade games . In particular, home versions of arcade games sometimes had problems with flickering and slow down when more than a few moving objects appeared on the screen at once. GCC, which had a background in creating arcade games, designed their new system with a graphical architecture similar to arcade machines of the time. The 7800 featured the ability to move around tremendous amount of objects (75-to-100) that far exceeded previous consoles. Powering the system was a  6502C  processor running at 1.79 MHz, similar to the processor found in home computers (Atari 8-bit,  Apple II , Commodore 64) and other consoles (Atari 5200 and  Nintendo Entertainment System ) but running at almost twice the clock frequency.   In response to the criticisms of the Atari 5200, the Atari 7800 could play almost all Atari 2600 games out of the box, without the need for an adapter. In addition, it featured a return to a digital controller.   To address the concerns of parents that home computers were a better investment than consoles, the system was designed to be upgraded to a full-fledged home computer. A keyboard was developed, and the keyboard had an expansion port (which was the SIO port from Atari's 8-bit computer line, though the 7800 could not run Atari computer programs) allowed for the addition of peripherals such as disk drives and printers.   To enhance the gaming experience further, GCC had also designed a 'high score cartridge,' a battery-backed  RAM  cart designed for storing game scores. On the side of the 7800 was an expansion port, reportedly for a planned connection with a  laserdisc  player.     [ edit ]   Initial test market and shelving   The 7800 was test-marketed in southern  California  in June 1984, following an announcement on May 21st, 1984 at the Summer  Consumer Electronics Show  (CES). Thirteen games were initially announced, including  Ms. Pac-Man ,  Pole Position II ,  Centipede ,  Joust ,  Dig Dug , Desert Falcon,  Robotron: 2084 ,  Galaga ,  Xevious ,  Food Fight ,  Ballblazer ,  Rescue on Fractalus! , and  Track and Field . Atari was a sponsor of the  1984 Summer Olympics  and planned to push the 7800 aggressively in time for Christmas that year.   One month later,  Warner Communications  sold Atari's Consumer Division to  Jack Tramiel , who did not want to release a new video game console under his newly formed Atari Corporation. He pulled the plug on all projects related to video games and decided to focus on Atari's existing computer line in order to begin development of the new 16-bit computer line (which appeared as the  Atari ST ).   The Atari 7800 languished on the warehouse shelves until it was re-introduced in the summer of 1986 after the success of the Nintendo Entertainment System proved that the video game market was still viable.   Tramiels marketing push was far more subdued than Warner had planned originally. The keyboard and high score cartridge were canceled and the expansion port was removed from later production runs of the system. Tramiel dusted off any games that were completed from the original 1984 launch with the color labels of the original games often being replaced with low-cost black and white labels. Advertising was not a priority, with Tramiel pushing the system to market with a meager $300,000 marketing budget that could not compare with the multi-million dollar campaigns by  Nintendo  and  Sega .     [ edit ]   Graphics   The strengths and weaknesses of the 7800's graphics are often debated. The graphics are generated by a custom Graphics Processing Unit called MARIA (a name chosen to represent its succession from the Atari 2600's graphics and sound chip, TIA ... TIA-MARIA). MARIA is very different from other second and third generation consoles, which made it more difficult for game programmers to make the transition. Instead of a limited number of hardware sprites, the MARIA allows for a much larger number of sprites described in a list of display lists. Each display list contains sprite entries with pointers to graphics data, color information, and horizontal positioning. The same display list is used for multiple rasters with the pointers being automatically adjusted. However, managing and displaying a large number of sprites required much more CPU time (both directly and indirectly since the MARIA would halt the CPU when drawing sprites) than consoles with hardware sprites and backgrounds.   MARIA has a number of different graphics modes which are either 160 pixels wide or 320 pixels wide. While the 320 pixel modes theoretically enable the 7800 to create games at higher resolution than the 256 pixel wide graphics found in the  Nintendo Entertainment System  and  Sega Master System , the intense processing demands of MARIA typically meant that programmers created their games using the lower 160 pixel modes.   The 7800, like other Atari consoles, featured a (then) broad palette of 256 colors. Up to 25 colors could be displayed on screen at one time in the absence of special hardware tricks, though demos exist which place all 256 colors on the screen at the same time. Sprites can be between 4 and 12 colors.   The MARIAs approach had advantages and disadvantages when it came to generating graphics in software during the lifespan of the 7800. It excelled at moving around large numbers of sprites on a static screen without the screen flickering that plagued other 8-bit systems. Its flexible design enabled it to play games which used display list manipulation to generate a pseudo 3D appearance such as  Ballblazer  (1987) and  F-18 Hornet  (1988). While side-scrolling games in the vein of  Super Mario Brothers  are possible on the system (1990's Scrapyard Dog is the best example), it is significantly harder to develop such a title than on a tile-based system such as the Nintendo Entertainment System.     [ edit ]   Sound   A common criticism of the 7800 regards its use of the TIA to provide 2-channel sound effects and music, resulting in sound quality that is virtually identical to the Atari 2600 VCS from 1977. While the inclusion of 2600 hardware is required to maintain compatibility with the older system, this drove up production costs and reduced available space on the 7800s motherboard. As such, the 7800 does not include additional hardware for generating sound as it does with graphics and the sound hardware is considered the weakest part of the system.   To compensate for this, GCCs engineers allowed games to include a  POKEY audio chip  in the cartridge which substantially improved the audio quality. To ensure software developers had an economical means of producing better sound than TIA, GCC had originally planned to make a low-cost, high performance sound chip, GUMBY, which could also be placed in 7800 cartridges to enhance its sound capabilities further. This project was cancelled when Atari was sold to Jack Tramiel.   Despite having the capability to support sound chips in cartridges, almost no 7800 cartridges feature POKEY hardware for enhanced sound. Ballblazer, released in 1987, uses the POKEY to generate all music and sound effects. Similarly, Commando, released in 1989, uses a POKEY to generate in-game music while the TIA generates the game's sound effects for a total of 6 channels of sound.     [ edit ]   Lockout features   Following the debate over  Custer's Revenge , a controversial Atari 2600 VCS title with adult themes, Atari had concerns over similar adult titles finding their way onto the 7800 and displaying adult graphics on the significantly improved graphics of the MARIA chip. To combat this, they included a digital signature protection method which prevented unauthorized 7800 games from being played on the system.   When a cartridge was inserted into the system, the 7800 BIOS included code which would generate a digital signature of the cartridge ROM and compare it to the signature stored on the cartridge. If a correct signature was located on the cartridge, the 7800 would operate in 7800 mode, granting the game access to MARIA and other features. If a signature was not located, the 7800 remained in 2600 mode and MARIA was unavailable. All 7800 games released in North America had to be digitally signed by Atari. This digital signature code is not present in PAL 7800s, which use various heuristics to detect 2600 cartridges, due to export restrictions.     [ edit ]   Comparison with the Atari 2600 VCS             This article or section contains  weasel words , vague phrasing that often accompanies  biased  or  unverifiable  information. Such statements should be  clarified or removed .       A view held by some was that the 7800 was essentially a souped up 2600. Even in an interview,  Leonard Tramiel  supported this viewpoint, stating ""the 7800 is essentially a 2600 with some things put into hardware that were done in software on the 2600."" [ 2 ]  While this view is shared by many, the 7800 is different than the 2600 in several important areas. It features a full 6502c processor whereas the 2600 VCS has a stripped down 6507 processor which runs at a slower speed. It has additional  RAM  (Random Access Memory) and the ability to access more cartridge data at one time than the 2600. The most substantial difference, however, is its entirely different graphics architecture which differs markedly from either the Atari 2600 VCS or Ataris 8-bit line of computers.   The source of the confusion stems from the fact that compatibility with the Atari 2600 is enabled by including the same chips used in the Atari 2600. When operating in 2600 mode in order to play 2600 titles, the 7800 uses a Television Interface Adapter (TIA) chip to generate graphics and sound. The processor is slowed to 1.19 MHz in order to mirror the performance of the 2600s stripped-down 6507 processor. RAM is limited to 128 bytes found in the RIOT and game data is accessed in 4K blocks.   When in 7800 mode (signified by the appearance of the full screen Atari logo), the graphics are generated entirely by the MARIA graphics processing unit, all system RAM is available and game data is accessed in larger 48K blocks. The systems 6502c runs at its normal 1.79 MHz instead of the reduced speed of 2600 mode. The 2600 chips are used in 7800 mode to generate sound as well as switch and controller interfaces.     [ edit ]   Software library   The Atari 7800 faced the severe software drought that would plague all the Atari Corp. consoles sold after the video game crash. While the system can actually play hundreds of different cartridge titles (due to its compatibility with the Atari 2600), the number of titles specifically designed for the Atari 7800 hardware is the lowest of any commercially released Atari system. Only about 60 titles were released during its original production run. The system has a fan base who appreciate its solid conversions of early 1980s arcade hits as well as quirky original titles and computer ports. However, there are notable flaws in the Atari 7800's game library that prevented it from achieving the success of its contemporary competitors.     [ edit ]   Initially dated library and low development investment   The initial launch titles in 1986 were not competitive in the marketplace following the video game crash. Rather than investing in competitive games for the system, Jack Tramiel initially preferred to dust off the systems pre-crash library, which were less detailed than post-crash games such as  Super Mario Bros.  These games seemed dated, and did not resonate with mainstream audiences.   After releasing the initial pre-crash titles, Atari began development on new 7800 titles but their investment in development and production was very limited. Numerous Tramiel-era 7800 games were quickly rushed to market and with work done by low cost developers resulting in games which were disappointingly unpolished and lacking in features.   Steve Golson from GCC would later remark, Jack [Tramiel] couldnt get any development done for new games. He tried to get people to develop games for the system but he wasnt willing to pay them any money. So, none of the game developers were willing to work on it.   A key differentiator between games on the  Nintendo Entertainment System  and  Sega Master System  compared to games before the crash was the overall size of the game programs. Whereas games prior to the 1983 video game crash were typically 4K to 32K, games released after 1985 were often 128K to 640K (1 to 5 megabits in size). The 8-bit processors in consoles limited how much game data could be accessed at once, so game data was accessed in small (32K to 64K) bankswitched sections.   While the Atari 7800 is capable of playing bankswitched games, neither its pre-crash library, nor Tramiels first releases made use of bankswitching, with games being 16K to 48K in size. This severely limited the amount of complexity on the initial run of Atari 7800 games when compared to the competition. While some initial 7800 games were referred to as Super Games, this was a marketing spin that typically referred to a game which had previously appeared on a home computer and not to the size of the cartridge itself. Consumers complained that Atari 7800 lacked the depth and variation often found on Nintendo and Sega machines.   In response to criticisms about the shallowness of their game depth, Atari later began to use bankswitching in 1988, releasing 64K and later 128K (1 megabit games). By the end of the systems life cycle, most games were 128K in size, with a few being 144K. While the system was certainly capable of playing even larger games (4 megabit and beyond) no games of that size were developed.     [ edit ]   Availability of current arcade conversions   At the time, a key driver for success with a home console was the number of home conversions it had of popular arcade games. This had been a primary reason for the success of the Atari 2600 VCS against systems like the Intellivision.   During the Atari 7800s life cycle, Atari found themselves struggling to get developers to create 7800 versions of then-popular arcade titles because of a controversial policy employed by Nintendo. When Nintendo revived the industry, they signed up software development companies to create NES games under a strict license agreement which imposed serious restrictions on what they were allowed to do. One of the key clauses was that companies who made Nintendo games were not allowed to make that game on a competing system for a period of two years. Because of the market success of the NES, companies chose to develop for it first and were thus barred from developing the same games on competing systems for two years.   The software libraries of the Atari 7800 and Sega Master System suffered tremendously as a result. The 7800 fared even worse due to the fact that Sega could draw from their own library of arcade hits in supporting the Master System (Ataris arcade division had been spun off into a separate company in 1984). The Atari 7800 was often forced to fill the void with either computer conversions or original titles, to varying degrees of success.   Some NES titles were developed by companies who had licensed their title from a different arcade manufacturer. While the creator of the NES version would be restricted from making a competitive version of an NES game, the original arcade copyright holder was not precluded from licensing out rights for a home version of an arcade game to multiple systems. Through this loophole, Atari 7800 conversions of Mario Bros., Double Dragon, Commando, Rampage, Xenophobe, Ikari Warriors and Kung Fu Master were licensed and developed.     [ edit ]   Exclusive content and missing genres   A primary criticism of the Atari 7800s library is that many games on the system were also available elsewhere. Most of the original lineup of games had already appeared on either Ataris 2600, 5200 or 8-bit computers. This practice continued after Jack Tramiels takeover of Atari as many 7800 games also appeared on the 2600 and XE Game Systems as well. Later, many games that were on the 7800 also appeared on the Atari Lynx.   The Atari 7800s small library also suffered because some key genres were either unrepresented (role playing games), poorly represented (sports games), or had a disproportionate glut of titles (flight simulators)     [ edit ]   Third-party software support   There was virtually no effort by Atari Corp. to recruit third party developers, and most software houses were locked into making Nintendo games for the NES. Eight third party Atari 7800 titles were manufactured by three companies (Absolute, Activision, and Froggo) with the rest manufactured by Atari themselves. However, most Atari development was actually contracted out.     [ edit ]   Peripherals          The  gamepad  of the Atari 7800.       Unlike Nintendo or Sega, Atari was unwilling to invest in many peripherals for the 7800. The most notable peripheral was the XG-1 lightgun, which came bundled with the Atari XE Game System. The XG-1 was fully compatible with the 7800 and was sold separately for owners of other Atari systems. Atari released four 7800 light gun games  Alien Brigade, Crossbow, Meltdown and Barnyard Blaster.   In response to criticism over ergonomic issues in the 7800s proline controllers, Atari later released joypad controllers with European 7800s, which were similar in style to controllers found on Nintendo and Sega Systems.     [ edit ]   Market performance   The Atari 7800 remained active officially between 1986 and 1991. On January 1, 1992, Atari Corp. formally announced abandonment of the Atari 7800, in addition to the Atari 2600, the Atari 8-bit computer line, and the Atari XE Game System. By the time of the cancellation, Nintendo's NES had dominated the market, controlling 80% of the North American market while Atari Corp. only controlled 12%. [ 3 ]   The Atari 7800 distantly trailed the Nintendo Entertainment System in terms of units sold but was a profitable enterprise for Atari Corp., coasting largely on Ataris name and its 2600 compatibility. Profits were strong, due to low investment in game development and marketing. However, Ataris marketing of the 7800 helped to further tarnish their reputation, ultimately leading to their continuous decline with subsequent systems such as the Jaguar and Lynx.     [ edit ]   Homebrew community and emulation   When emulators of 1980s video game consoles began to appear on home computers in the late 1990s, the Atari 7800 was one of the last to be emulated. The lack of awareness of the system, the lack of understanding of the hardware, and fears about the digital signature lockout initially caused concerns. Since that time, however, the 7800 has been emulated successfully and is now common on emulation sites.   The digital signature long prevented homebrew games from being developed until the original encryption generating software was discovered. When the original digital signature generating software was turned over to the Atari community, development of new Atari 7800 titles began. In addition, the Atari community has slowly uncovered the original 7800 development tools and released them into the public domain. New tools, documentation, source code and utilities for development have since been created which has sponsored additional homebrew development. Several new commercial Atari 7800 titles such as Beef Drop, Bon*Q, Pac Man Collection, Combat 1990, Santa Simon, and Space War have been created and released.   Perhaps the most interesting recent development was the creation of the Cuttle Cart II, a device that allowed the Atari 7800 to read MMC cards containing binary files of Atari 7800 programs. The Cuttle Cart II has enabled more people to play the entire 2600 and 7800 library on an original system as well as binaries of unreleased games and new homebrew titles.   The Cuttle Cart II was a success by homebrew standards, selling out both production runs and commanding high prices on Ebay.     [ edit ]   New mainstream releases   In 2004, Atari (now owned by Infogrames) released the first Atari Flashback console. This system resembled a miniature Atari 7800 and joysticks and had 20 built in games (five 7800 and twenty 2600 titles). While the unit sold well, it was controversial among Atari fans. Atari had given the engineering firm, Legacy Engineering, extremely limited development timelines. The firm was forced to build the Flashback using NES-On-A-Chip hardware instead of recreating the Atari 7800 hardware. As a result, the Flashback has been criticized for failing to properly replicate the actual Atari gaming experience.   Legacy Engineering was later commissioned to create another 7800 project that never made it to market. A reseller with millions of unsold Atari 2600 and 7800 games acquired from the Tramiels looked into remaking the system and bringing it to market as a way for new customers to play old Atari games. The project was cancelled after prototypes were made.     [ edit ]   Unreleased games   As with most game consoles, there were more games in development for the 7800 than were actually released. However, very few prototypes have been located, due to Tramiel Ataris reluctance to make them in the first place. Atari 7800 prototypes tend to be highly coveted by collectors, often fetching hundreds of dollars when sold. Some collectors are unwilling to share the rare items publicly as doing so risks decreasing the value of their prototypes.   Nonetheless, some unreleased Atari 7800 games, as well as early versions of released games have been released to the public. A few have been manufactured and sold.   These include:     Klax  (Programmed by Blue Sky Software). The game was nearly completed when canceled. For years, it was traded privately until a ROM was made available to the general public. Later, the developer appeared to create additional levels for the community.   Gato  (Programmed by Ibid Inc Software). Released on the XE Game System, an Atari 7800 version was started but not completed beyond a simple demo.   Missing in Action  (Programmed by Sculptured Software for TNT Games). A side scrolling adventure that was about 85% complete when canceled. The game is mostly playable with some later collision detection issues requiring cheats to get past.   Pit-Fighter  (Programmed by Imagitec Design). An early demo of the game has been found, with crude graphics, no sound and poor collision detection.   Rescue on Fractalus!  (Programmed by GCC). A conversion of the popular computer game was released by GCC in 2004. The game was partially complete with a running engine but no enemies. Other 7800 games remain lost, despite indications that development occurred. The most notable of these are  Skyfox  (shown on the back of the original system box) and  Electrocop  (artwork has since been uncovered).
