The subject RFP is a full and open competitive acquisition providing Oil Program Center support for: 1) development and implementation of regulations; 2) evaluation of data; and 3) evaluation of public comments made in response to rule making activities.  The Oil Program Center is responsible for developing national strategy, programs, technical policies, regulations and guidelines to prevent, prepare, and respond to oil spills.  EPA will award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract structured with a base period of three years, and two option periods of two years each, for a total possible period of performance of seven years.  The total level of effort (LOE) is estimated at approximately 140,000, consisting of 40,000 LOE under the base quantity of the base period; 20,000 LOE under the optional quantity of the base period; 26,500 LOE under the base quantity for option period I;   13,500 LOE under the optional quantity of option period I; 26,500 LOE under the base quantity of option period II; and 13,500 LOE under the optional quantity of option period II.

Furthermore, an Offeror will be ineligible for award under this solicitation if the EPA determines that the Offeror, or the proposed subcontractors, at the time of award, own or operate an oil industry.  ""Owns or operates"" is defined for the purposes of this solicitation in the Federal Register (40 CFR 260.10 and 45 FR 33169).   ""Oil industry"" is defined for this solicitation as any industry that includes (a) edible and nonedible oils and related products, devices and affiliations related to non-transportation facilities that handle, store, or transport oil; or (b) any emerging or existing remediation technologies, products, devices, chemical and/or biological agents used in oil spill mitigation per 40 CFR 300.900.    Offerors shall submit a disclosure statement that includes all current ownership, operation or significant financial or business interest the offeror (the prime Contactor), including any first, second, or third-tier parent companies or subsidiaries or other companies has in an oil industry that would be subject to or impacted by the rulemaking or promulgated regulations, and either propose how the exsting COI situation will be avoided or mitigated prior to contract award or demonstrate why the relationship dos not pose a COI.    No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued.  All inquiries shall be directed to Olivia J. Rogers via email at rogers-slayden.olivia@epa.gov.

The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company?s overall financial status.    Binder, Vinyl Clad 1-1/2 inch Round Ring (7510-00-NIB-0130, 7510-00-NIB-0145 through -0151: 1 1/2 inch vinyl clad round ring binders in the following colors: blue, red, gray, cinnamon, brown, green, jade and white); Four Month Planner (7520-00-NIB-1689: This dry erase calendar features a silk-screened 4-month calendar to keep track of all scheduled projects.  The 24 x 36 inch board provides ample space for writing important information.  Wallboard has a Melamine finish for each clean up and comes with an office decor, slate-blue frame. Wall hangers and instructions are included.) In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms.  To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List.  When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.    If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL.  For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

(A channel route structure moves passengers and cargo over established worldwide routes served by either scheduled Department of Defense aircraft under the control of AMC or commercial aircraft under contract to and scheduled by AMC.)  Evaluations and recommended solutions will address both short-term and long-term implications to the full spectrum of Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) peacetime operations.    AMC is currently researching its options and assessing industry's capability to accomplish this effort.  AMC DOY makes no guarantees that a contract will be awarded for this requirement.  Contractors who are able to satisfy the following requirements should submit a capability statement and company overview to AMC DOYR at the e-mail address included in this notice no later than COB, Friday, 14 Jan 00.  All information must be submitted electronically.    The contractor shall deliver a structured evaluation and recommended solutions regarding optimal assignment of aircraft in the existing channel route structure.

Also, contractor shall consider multiple (sometimes interdependent) factors, such as fleet composition, utilization rates, reliability and other logistics issues, aircrew availability, the Flying Hour Program, utilization of and commitment to the commercial sector, workload surges and volatility, customer behavior patterns, best commercial practices, and others.  Contractor shall be cognizant and experienced regarding transportation data systems within the Defense Transportation System (DTS).  Contractors are expected to apply their operations research and other analytical techniques.  Contractors will make use of data from  AMC's data warehouse.  Government personnel will monitor contractor effort, including four In Progress Reviews (IPRs) spaced equally throughout the Period of Performance.  IPRs one and three will each last one day.  IPRs two and four will each last two days.  Location of IPRs will be determined at a later date.  Contractor is responsible for its own travel and all associated costs if IPRs are at a location other than the contractor's home office.  A deliverable evaluation and recommendations are due 120 days after contract award.  Capability statements shall include a list of most recent and relevant contracts for providing similar services to include contract number, place of performance, customer point of contact, telephone number, contract type, amount of award, and period of performance.  The information should also include a very brief description of the services required and whether performance was considered acceptable or an explanation for performance problems noted.  Interested parties should indicate their ability to provide services with personnel who already possess, or have the ability to obtain, a Secret Clearance within thirty days after contract award.  Identify any existing federal supply contracts that may be used to obtain such services along with ordering information.  Page limit for capability statements is 25 pages.
