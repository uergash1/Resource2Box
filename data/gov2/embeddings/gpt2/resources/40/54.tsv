A notification will only be sent when the subscriber's search criteria are met.       We are setting this system up as an extra service and will try to ensure its reliability.   However, because electonic mail systems do not guarentee receipt, some email notifications may not be delivered. There is also a tremendous amount of data entered into the system, and errors made in entering data for any one  element (e.g., a document classification) may affect notice.       How do I subscribe to the ListServe?  First you will create a profile, then you will create one or more agents.       What is a profile?  A Profile uniquely identifies you by your email address.  It also allows you to create Agents that will forward search results to your Profile's email address.       What is an agent?  An Agent is an automatic document hunter. You tell the Agent what to look for, and every 24 hours it will retrieve a list of documents matching the criteria you entered. You can have multiple Agents.       How do I create my profile?  Enter your email address and click the ""Create"" button.  The system will send you an email to verify your email address.

GX008-23-15358650	"Rio Grande Valley Library System   Request It: How to Place Materials on Hold   (Note: the system will only allow you to place one hold on an item. At this time you may not place holds on videos, DVDs or music CDs.)  1. In the online catalog, find the  exact item  you want to      place on hold.   Click on the title to display the branch locations    and availability.   Do not click the box next to the title.  2. Click the ""REQUEST"" button at the top of the screen.  3. Type your first or last name.  4. Type the barcode number from your library card.  5. Click on the arrow beside  (Choose a Pickup Location)     to display a list of branches.  Then choose the branch    library where you want to pick up the book.        6. If there is a date after which you no longer want the item,    fill in that information.  (In the event the item is not    available by that date, your hold will be automatically    cancelled.)  7. Press the ""Submit above information"" button.  A confirmation    message will appear on the screen, indicating your request    has been placed.  8. When the material has arrived at the branch you specified, you will    receive a HOLD PICKUP NOTICE in the mail, an automated telephone    call or an e-mail reminder.  Or, when you view your circulation    record online, the message ""READY FOR PICKUP"" indicates that    your hold is available.  (""LOOK ON SHELF"" does not mean the     material is ready for you to pick up.)   Please be aware that    the material you select may come from any branch in the Library    system.  Items showing ""IN TRANSIT"" may take several days to    arrive.   9. Note: if your library card has expired or you have overdue books, you    will be unable to place a hold.  Call the Customer Service office at    768-5170 for assistance.   Back to Library Information   Back to Main Menu"
