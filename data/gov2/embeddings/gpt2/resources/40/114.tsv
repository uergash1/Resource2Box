That was a no-brainer. I felt cheated because the explanations to those problems were already in the Guides. MGMAT also shows you problems that are not relevant to GMAT - they want to make it appear as if GMAT is a test for becoming a rocket scientist. I invested in MLIC guides and was pleasantly surprised to find materials that were actually tested on the GMAT. I strongly recommend MLIC Guides for GMAT.             --- Maria Peterson, Dallas, TX""   ""After taking the GMAT and scoring 620, I decided to purchase MLIC's study notes for the GMAT, and was taken aback to find that some of the problems illustrated in the guides were very similar to, if not identical to, the a few problems I had struggled with during the test. Had I bought the guides before I took the test, I sure would have scored much better than I did and would not be writing this testimonial. MLIC materials provide strategies as well that are truly useful in dealing with critical reasoning and reading comprehension. The module 3 for sentence correction very comprehensively covers all grammar, idiom, and logic rules tested in SC.  MLIC study guides are a worthwhile investment.            --- Maralee Smith, Chicago, IL""   ""My verbal jumped quite significantly from 51 percentile to 89. Your study materials for the verbal section was really good and really helpful. Really taught me how to solve the questions. The materials were spot on in letting me know what to look for in the questions. Thanks to your thorough study guides and your  online program, my verbal scored improved a cool 40 percentile points. Your guides are the best.            --- K. Pine,Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia""     ""I took the Veritas prep course before I ordered MLIC GMAT study guides, and found the Veritas guides shallow in comparison.  Veritas course materials are the ones published by 800Score.com and Arco, and they use some retired GMAT questions. Veritas instructor was not as well informed either (he could not explain the concept of LCM in quantitative assessment).  In contrast, the MLIC study notes covered all areas extensively, and included discussion of areas I have never seen in any other prep materials available in the book stores. MLIC guides are worth more than the money I paid for them.            --- I. RAJA, PHILADELPHIA, PA""    ""I truly believe that all GMAT testtakers should obtain the amazingly thorough and profoundly relevant GMAT Study materials by MLIC that surely beat all other prep materials I have seen. I have worked through Manhattan GMAT and a mate gave me the Veritas guides before I bought MLIC prep notes. MLIC study notes for the GMAT are the best you can use to crack this test. Each of those modules covering the various GMAT sections is a gem, and you should not do without them.             --- Tom Osborn, Sydney, Australia""   ""I want to let you know that the incredible detail you pack into each GMAT study and training file allowed me to prepare for each GMAT section in the required depth. I had taken the Veritas GMAT prep course in December 2005. MLIC Study materials were vastly superior to those provided by Veritas Elite company. When I originally took my first practice exam after I took the Veritas course and before I took your Turboprep GMAT course, I scored a depressing 450.  Then, I took the Turboprep GMAT course and I scored a 680 on the GMAT.  A 230 point improvement, landing me in the 89th percentile and allowing a more competitive shot for admission to Columbia Business School.  I want to thank you for putting together such a terrific study guides and training materials. It was intensive and it provided me with the correct foundation and knowledge to gain the GMAT score that I was aiming for.""             --- JOSHUA SOFER, GMAT Turboprep course, Manhattan-NYC  GMAT Hall of Famer     ""Your study guides for the GMAT are the best preparatory materials I have laid my hands on. Your Study Guides are the most detailed and thorough, and the conversational style of explaining the concepts and procedures helped me master the GMAT sections. I must admit that I was slightly overwhelmed to work through 700+ pages of study files, over 2000 practice problems, and timed practice tests with pacing assistant (comments were cute!). However, it was worth it. Your GMAT study guides were the best use I found for my 79 dollars.""                    --- Erika Hanson, Topeka, Kansas             ""I thought Manhattan GMAT study guides were the best one could work with until I purchased MLIC study notes for the GMAT. Your study materials are the best and beat Manhattan GMAT hands down. I strongly recommend your study guides.  Good stuff.           Mallika Srinivasan, Chennai,India.""      ""I recently ordered your GMAT Study Guides and want to thank you for the excellent treatment of all GMAT concepts. The Reading Comprehension guide explaining the Ancho-phrase strategy for GMAT RC section is brilliant. I have never seen GMAT sentence correction rules and requirements explained in such detail and in depth. I am glad that I found your web-link through the blog at Business Week. I recommend your GMAT study materials to anyone seriously looking for a terrific GMAT score .""           -- Melissa Yeong, New York City, NY.""      ""I think you guys at MLICETS have done a wonderful job with the GMAT study guide that I purchased from you. I have ordered numerous other study guides for the GMAT from your competitors and they don't come close to your quality. I have to admit the one thing that I liked about the            -- Basir Sakandar, Dallas, TX""    ""Anyone who is serious about making a GMAT test score in the 700's required by top Business Schools should order your GMAT Study Guides. Your GMAT study Guides undoubtedly are the most useful preparation notes for the GMAT. I am grateful that I used your GMAT study notes. It sure made a big difference to my GMAT score, which jumped a cool 90 points. Thanks again.           ----Stacy Newman, Dublin, Ireland.""    ""Your GMAT study materials are without a doubt better than Manhattan GMAT's study guides. I have been terrified of Reading Comprehension on the GMAT but your study guide made it seem like such an easy thing to do.  My ranking of your study guides is as follows:  (1) Module 2 file for GMAT quantitative; (2) Module 3 file for Sentence Correction; (3) Module 5 for Reading Comprehension; (4) Module 4 for Critical Reasoning; and (5) Module I file for the Analytical Writing. (Your format for the argument essay is the best I have seen and makes analyzing an argument such a breeze). I was impressed and overwhelmed with the amount of practice tests and exercises you provide along with the study guides. ""              Rajiv Aggarwal, Mumbai, India.""          WHAT IS GMAT® CAT?                  GMAT® , acronym for  G raduate  M anagement  A dmission  T est, is administered by Pearson Vue® on behalf of GMAC® and is required by all  G raduate  S chools of  B usiness for admission purposes.               The GMAT, according to  GMAC                (Graduate Management Admission Council that owns the trademarks GMAT®  and GMAT CAT®, is one measure of your ability to               complete sucessfully the first year of graduate study program (MBA degree program) at a Graduate School of Business.However, effective January 2006, the paper and pencil version of the GMAT test is no longer offered anywhere in the world. GMATis              administered in a CAT(Computer Adaptive) format in which the GMAT test'adapts' the              difficulty level of GMAT questions to your GMAT-specific 'comfort level', with 'higher              difficulty level GMAT questions' carrying higher GMAT raw scores (GMAT Scaled              Scores) than do 'lower difficulty level' GMAT questions. The              GMAT tests your Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning skills, and your ability (i) to process information in context, (ii) to make necessarily true and probable interpretations of information presented, (iii) to stay focused on the specifics, and (iv) to test different scenarios for consistency of decisions. The GMAT test also is about your ability to determine whether GMAT sentences are logically, clearly, correctly, and effectively written.        MBA PROGRAM RANKINGS     1.

Therefore, put away those useless study Guides for the GMAT published by Kaplan (KAPTEST), Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Veritas GMAT prep, 800Score.com, Arco, Barrons, GMAT for Dummies, and others.               The GMAT study guides offered by MLIC are constantly updated to reflect changes              taking place on the GMAT test and to include information that mirrors the LIVE emphasis seen on the high difficulty problems tested on the GMAT.             Unlike other me-too prep outfits such as Kaplan, Manhattan GMAT, Veritas Prep, Manhattan Review, MLIC also updates its study guides and training materials frequently on the basis of a diagnosis of challenges faced by average trainees. The computer adaptive format of the test requires that the testing company - Pearson Vue -- create many different versions of the same test during a given month and vary the emphasis from time to time so that test-takers who repeat the tests do get tested with different emphasis the next time. MLIC study and training materials for the GMAT capture a variety of emphases monitored on the test, and get updated to reflect those changing emphases. Contrast this to the rather passive format of books published by Kaplan, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Veritas Prep, Arco, Barrons, et al., and you can see why MLIC Study Guides are the best source for GMAT preparation. We dare you to show us a better set of guides for GMAT readiness than the ones offered by MLIC. ORDER our              skill-enhancing and goal-driven GMAT Study Guides for 700+ GMAT Score today through PAYPAL, and              get set on your way to a GMAT score of better than 700.                                                                           WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE STUDY GUIDES YOU CAN                BUY FROM KAPLAN, ARCO, PRINCETON REVIEW, Veritas Prep, Manhattan GMAT, Barrons, ET AL?    The  other  GMAT study guides                out there and published by Kaplan, Arco, Princeton Review, and others were probably written at least 10 years ago, and are                never updated. Veritas Prep provides study materials that are a veritable collage of materials sourced from Arco, Barrons, 800Score.Com, OG, Oxford, and other miscellaneous sources. Manhattan GMAT study guide for Sentence Correction uses the example 'having a bat is fun' to show you that the subject is 'having', not 'bat'. The problem with this example used in Manhattan GMAT book is that the subject is a gerund, and the sentence is not as idiomatic as the expletive form: ""It is fun to have a bat"". Secondly, GMAT sentences will use subject qualifiers, object qualifiers and modifiers, and verb complements, all in the same sentence. The GMAT sentences are not as simple as illustrated in MGMAT guide;  only MLIC teaches you how to diagram a sentence and identify the structural elements such as the qualifiers for subject, qualifiers for object, complements for the verbs, nouns, and qualifiers, etc. MLIC Guide for SC will also show you that GMAT Sentence Correction is not only about grammar and idiom rules but also about rules of logic. No other study guide out there will cover 1/10th of what MLIC guide covers. MLIC Guide for Critical Reasoning teaches you the subject-scope-qualifier strategy and trains you in answer selection by intelligently eliminating answer options by categorizing them as vague, extreme, politically incorrect, not commonsensical, commonsensical but expectational, etc.  Module V file for Reading Comprehension demystifies this section, and shows  you a workable 'anchor phrase strategy' that allows you to identify context-specific information relevant to the question. You will also learn in this file how you can pick the correct answer even if you did not have the time to read and comprehend the passage in its entirety. Our Module II and its companion guides such as ""Quantitative Concepts in a Nutshell"" will provide the most comprehensive coverage of quantitative concepts and procedures reflecting the current emphasis on the LIVE problems, and teach you different nuanced ways in which the concepts can be tested. For  example, the concept of weighted average, you will learn, is about how the midpoint of values shifts and how MUCH it shifts. The understanding of the former attribute is critical to answering some Data Sufficiency problems.  Last, but not least, our Module I file arms you with a good template for writing professional-grade essays. In short, MLIC Study Guides are the best preparatory materials and beat all other study guides and study notes published by other companies.   The GMAT CAT is constantly evolving and a GMAT study guide                that provides static information is not your best ally in your                effort to achieve the best possible GMAT test score.                The other GMAT study                guides such as the ones you can buy from Kaplan, Princeton Review, 800SCORE.COM, MANHATTAN GMAT, Veritas Prep,               or Arco do not cover all the concepts tested on the GMAT. To add                insult to injury, these other GMAT study guides published by Kaplan, Arco, Barrons, Princeton Review, and others focus on some                silly tricks that do not work most of the time, if at all. MLIC Study Guides for 700+ Score -- Your one-stop                comprehensive resource that will surely give you deeper                insights into the concepts and procedures relevant to acing the GMAT, and help you achieve a GMAT test score in the 700's.  ORDER THE GMAT STUDY GUIDES  using PALPAL today!                 WHY ARE OUR GMAT STUDY GUIDES BETTER THAN              THE 'OFFICIAL GUIDE FOR GMAT REVIEW'?                              The ""Official Guide to GMAT                  Review"" advises you that you must consult a good 'text book' to                  improve your GMAT-specific verbal and quantitative skills. The Official Guide to GMAT Review                  provides real GMAT questions that were tested about 7 to 10 years                  ago but does not disclose the most recent types of GMAT questions or                  show you how to develop and hone a good and solid understanding                  of the concepts tested on the GMAT CAT. The reason is simple: If                  the official Guide to GMAT Review gave you a GMAT strategy or showed you the                  appropriate best strategy for dealing with the different GMAT                  assessment areas, the integrity of the GMAT test will be compromised                  and the Business Schools will stop accepting GMAT as a                  requirement for admission. Also, the explanations provided for                  the various problems in the Official Guide to GMAT Review will                  require another GMAT guide to understand. (For example, the Official                  Guide explains why Choice B is incorrect by stating that 'it                  uses words in improper temporal sequence' or 'explains' the sets                  and conditional probability in terms of arcane and esoteric                  'formulas' rather than in terms of concepts.) GMAT is an                  'application test' and requires that you hone your skill in the                  GMAT concept areas, and further requires that you 'use your                  understanding of the concepts' to 'make LOGICAL decisions'. The                  Official Guide to GMAT Review will never explain the purpose of                  the GMAT or what it takes to do well on the GMAT test. Why? Because,                  let us face it, the real customers for the Educational Testing Service or the Graduate Management Admission Council  are                  not the poor test-takers such as you, but the Graduate Schools of Business,                  and it will be a suicidal proposition for the GMAT Testing Company to                  show all the cards, to disclose the best strategies for taking                  the GMAT test, and to train you with the most recent types of                  GMAT test questions. If they did, no Business School will require GMAT                  score as a necessary factor in the admission decision. Only our                  GMAT Study Guides will explain the GMAT-specific concepts in a manner that makes                  sense to all GMAT test-takers.

Because you are taking a GMAT in a                  timed-environment, we have designed the GMAT study materials to                  give you the conceptual skills and the understanding required to                  deal efficiently with the timed format of the GMAT test. You                  will learn the most efficient ways in which to deal with the                  quantitative and the verbal areas of the GMAT, and to manage                  your time wisely and to your best advantage.    MODULE I  file (75 pages) for Analytical Writing Assessment teaches you how to identify the specifics of the issue presented to you, and how to develop arguments in support of your clear and consistent position on the issues. It teaches you how to turn examples into perspectives and how to structure the analysis. A sure recipe for getting the top score of 6.0.  The section on Argument essay writing teaches you the basics of Arguments (a must read primer that logically leads into Critical Reasoning), and how to identify the assumptions of arguments by turning the maybe scenarios into assumptions. You will also be provided a template that works every time, and allows you to cover all required elements such as assumptions, counter-scenarios, counter-example, and questions seeking additional information by simply creating a list of maybe scenarios. Our trainees have consistently found this format compelling and a sure recipe for the top score of 6.0     MODULE II  file (220 pages) along with its companion guides titled 'Quantitative Concepts in a nutshell""(80 pages) and ""geometry formulas"" (25 pages) provide the most comprehensive coverage of all concepts and procedures tested in Quantitative assessment. The newer emphasis monitored on the test in the areas of standard deviation, sequences and functions, coordinate geometry, combinatorics and conditional probability, are all extensively covered and illustrated with problems reflecting the emphasis seen on LIVE GMAT problems. You will also learn that the concepts of ratios/proportion and weighted averages are tested in many ways: as mixture problems, as distance problems, as probability, and in geometry. You will learn how to make PONFI interpretation of information presented to you so that you can test for consistency across different scenarios while dealing with data sufficiency section. As many who purchased our study guides have opined, this module alone is worth the price of $79 you will pay for the entire gold mine of 5 major modules.    MODULE III  file (120 pages) and its companion guide ""Sentence Correction in a nutshell""(60 pages) cover all grammar, idiom, and logic rules, and rules of parallelism tested in Sentence Correction. You will learn how to dissect a sentence in terms of subject, qualifiers for subject and object, and complements for verbs and qualifiers, etc. and to identify the problems in sentences. A complex sentence such as the following needs to be dissected as shown: ""The work of John Voigt, a world-renowned physicist at the University of Melbourne, on the geometry of crystals that have not been fully analyzed has great significance in the study of Islamic architecture predating 16th century."" The subject 'work' has been described in terms of 'whose work it is' and in terms of 'in what area the work was done'. The object of the qualifier 'of John Voigt' is modified by the phrase that follows the comma. The object of the qualifier 'on the geometry of crystals' is qualified in terms of 'crystals that have not been fully analyzed'. The complement 'significance' is qualified with an adjective and another qualifier. Notice that the qualifiers add information to the sentence and also create distraction. The subject 'work' needs to be matched to the verb 'has' that is separated by intervening qualifiers for subject and object. No other guide out there (believe us, Manhattan GMAT guide is a joke) will explain the intricacies involved in getting a grasp of the elements of a sentence. You will learn a whole host of other good stuff that will enable you to master this section. MLIC Guide for Sentence Correction is the best prep notes you can find for Sentence Correction.     MODULE IV  file (120 pages) covering Critical Reasoning trains you in identifying different types of arguments, shows you how to process the information by being a qualifier police and a 'ly' detector. You will also learn that the selection is a process that is about determining why you will NOT pick 4 of the 5 options, and on what basis to make that determination. The module will also teach you was statements and what specific elements within a statement constitute important items of information critical to the answer. Various types of questions are illustrated with plenty of examples and detailed critiques.     MODULE V  file (120 pages) for Reading Comprehension teaches you how to determine the MAIN IDEA of the passage by identifying the elements of emphasis and transitional phrases within the passage and how to process the contents of the passage in terms of its structure: context, commentary, and basis for commentary. You will also learn the anchor-phrase™ strategy for identifying context-specific information relevant to the question. Last, but not least, there is a chapter on how to arrive at the correct answer even without knowing what the passage is about. MLIC has cracked the mystery behind Reading Comprehension and shows you how to attack this section.

GMAT AWA:  Analysis of an                        Issue Essay  measures your ability to understand the                        crux of the Issue provided, to take a position, and to                        explain your position by making two different arguments                        looking at the issue from two different perspectives.                         The  Argument  essay measures your ability to                        critique an argument and to explain why the conclusion                        stated in the argument does not logically follow from the                        evidence provided. You will be required to identify the                        various assumptions made in the line of reasoning, and to                        suggest counter scenarios that will 'question' the                        validity of the assumptions. Our GMAT Study Guides will explain                        the requirements and give you a structured format that                        will help you get the perfect score in the GMAT AWA section.                                                 GMAT VERBAL:  The GMAT                        sentence correction  section is about your ability to apply the rules of grammar, idiom, and logic to determine whether the sentence as written meets the test or requires fixing. This section will require that you identify the specifics of the sentence in terms of the subject, verb, complement, qualifiers for subject, object, and the complement, and that you ensure that the sentence is written in a logical fashion. The purpose of a sentence is to express a complete and logical thought, and to be consistent with the rules of grammar, idiom, and logic. You will be required to enforce subject-verb agreement and noun-pronoun agreement, fix pronoun problems including problems arising from the use of relative pronouns, use correct verb tense, and to make sure that the qualifiers and modifiers are placed correctly in the sentence. You will also be required to make sure that the comparisons that are  sought to be made are apples and apples comparisons and logically made. Consider the following sentence:  ""Within the past few years, many physicians have chosen early retirement rather than face the prospect of lawsuits."" Notice that the sentence states that the physicians have chosen a NOUN (early retirement) rather than a VERB (face the prospect of lawsuits). This is illogical comparison involving a noun and a verb. We can change the sentence to read: ""Within the past few years, many physicians have chosen early retirement rather than lawsuits filed against them."" However, this would not be logical because the physicians DO NOT CHOOSE LAWSUITS. Lawsuits come to them. A more logical fix would be to say, ""within the past few years, many physicians have elected TO RETIRE early rather than (to) FACE THE PROSPECT of lawsuits."" Notice that the correct answer logically states that the physicians chose one verb instead of another (parallel use of infinitives).    The GMAT study guides by MLIC  will show                        you how to recognize the requirements of grammar, idiom, and logic, and to identify various elements of a GMAT sentence in order to get a handle on all of these requirements. No                        other study material for the GMAT covers the GMAT Sentence Correction section as                        thoroughly and as comprehensively as our GMAT Study Guides do.                            The GMAT  CRITICAL                        REASONING  section tests your ability to make LOGICAL                        Conclusions or Inferences, to make logical explanations, and                        to deal with the ILLOGICAL arguments in terms of looking                        for information that will weaken it or strengthen it or                        identify the underlying assumption. GMAT Critical Reasoning section requires                        that the GMAT test-takers pay attention to QUALIFIERS used to                         LIMIT THE SCOPE   of the GMAT arguments, and to deal                        with the  SPECIFICS of the                        CONCLUSION , without interpreting the conclusion.                        For example, if the conclusion reads:  ""The                         continuing war effort in Iraq   will lead to                        increase in gas prices"",  you should not 'interpret'                        this conclusion to mean that  'the                        continuing war  on terror  is                        unethical or bad for the global economy' . You                        should be looking to weaken or strengthen this GMAT argument by                        looking for a reason why or why not the 'continuing war                        effort in IRAQ (not in Afghanistan or the 'war on terror')                        will  necessarily  lead to increase in gas prices'. Our                        GMAT Study Guides will explain the Subject/Scope/Qualifier                        strategy, and give you a set of HIT LIST words and phrases                        so that you can take the GMAT test in an efficient and effective manner.                            GMAT Reading                        Comprehension  is about your ability to identify the COMMENTARY that is made by the author by looking for and identifying statements containing emphasis, strong tones, transitional elements such as however, yet, on the contrary, and figures of speech. You will be required to identify the structure of the passages in terms of context, commentary, and basis for commentary, and to deal with questions asking you to show comprehension of commentary and to handle questions dealing with the context and basis for commentary. GMAT Study Guides will show you how to identify the commentary and how to hone in on information relevant to the question by using anchor-phrase strategy. You will also learn how to pick the correct answer even if you do not have a good understanding of the passage or did not have the time to read the passage. MLIC Study Guides are the best as evidenced by the fact that our LSAT trainees, who have to deal with 4 long passages and 27 questions in 35 minutes, unanimously opine that they have never found anything that is as extraordinary as MLIC Guides.                                                   GMAT QUANTITATIVE                        ASSESSMENT : This GMAT section is about your ability to                        apply your conceptual understanding of  Arithmetic,                        Algebra, Geometry, and Statistics  to solve problems                        and to determine whether there is sufficient information                        with which to make a unique and logical determination with                        respect to a question posed. This GMAT test section is about your                        REASONING ABILITY and about your comfort level with the                        different GMAT quantitative concepts tested. Bear in mind that the GMAT test is about 'making                        decisions' by using 'what is already known at a conceptual                        level' and 'what else is provided in the problem'. For                        example, if the GMAT problem states that  ""X is                        a prime digit"",  we must interpret this statement to                        mean that X could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 because a  'digit'  is an  integer   having                        a value between 0 and 9. You will learn in our valuable                        MODULE II dealing with GMAT Quantitative Assessment how to                        hone your conceptual understanding of GMAT quantitative areas, and how to reason from                        your 'conceptual ground zero'. Our GMAT Study Guides users would have us                        believe that our GMAT Quantitative MODULE II explaining the GMAT Quantitative                        Assessment alone is worth the $79 charge for the entire                        set of GMAT study guides. We dare you to find anything that is better than our guides for Quantitative assessment.                                               WHAT IS GMAT (GRADUATE MANAGEMENT ADMISSION TEST), AND WHAT DOES              GMAT MEASURE?                            GMAT® , acronym for  Graduate Management Admission              Test,  is the registered trademark of              Graduate Management Admission Council, and   is a              standard requirement for admission to Graduate Business Schools and to all M.B.A. degree programs in the USA and around the world .  The              GMAT test Score is one of several critical factors used by the              Graduate Schools of Business in their admission decisions, and a GMAT              test score that corresponds to a percentile ranking of 85% to 90% is a              must for your application to be seriously considered for admission to M.B.A. degree program at an A-List school. The              GMAT test is administered in a CAT format in which the GMAT test 'adapts' the              difficulty level of the GMAT to your 'comfort level'. The GMAT is              about your ability to do Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning, and to deal with the 'specifics' of the information              presented to you, and about your ability to make 'logical              interpretation' of the conceptual and other evidence presented to              you. The test measures your ability to    provide logical explanations for phenomena or observations;    provide alternative explanations for evidentiary information;    logically explain a discrepancy or a paradox;    Process information in context and interpret information in a necessarily true way;    make logical decisions by invoking core concepts tested on the GMAT;    understand and stay focused on the question, and pick an answer that is relevant to the question;    see patterns and do logical extrapolations, among other things.     The GMAT® has three              assessment areas:    AWA  (Analytical Writing Assessment)              that requires you to write Two essays, one analyzing an Issue              and the other analyzing an Argument. This first essay section on the GMAT is not 'adaptive'              and receives a separate score of between 0 and 6.   GMAT Quantitative Assessment  is the first              of the two 'adaptive' sections on the GMAT and follows the Analytical Writing section, and requires that you              answer 37 questions in problem solving and in Data Sufficiency in 75 minutes (nearly 1/4 of the questions will not be scored). Following the GMAT Quantitative section, you will be required to work on the last 'adaptive' section on              the GMAT is  Verbal              Assessment , which requires that you answer 41              questions in 75 minutes. The GMAT Verbal assessment includes three sections: GMAT Critical Reasoning, GMAT Sentence Correction, and GMAT Reading Comprehension. GMAT adaptive sections also include              experimental questions, at least 9 in GMAT Quantitative assessment and 11              in GMAT Verbal assessment. The two adaptive sections on the GMAT receive a combined             score of between 200 and 800. Most A-List Business Schools rated in the top-10 will              require a GMAT test score of at least 680 in order for you to be              competitive. (the percentile rankings corresponding to scores of between 600 and 640 have decreased in the past few years). Your best chance for success lies in your ability to              take the GMAT exam at the high difficulty level throughout and to score better than 700. The MLICETS GMAT prep              courses offer the best GMAT test training, using the  most recent and high difficulty level questions that are live on the GMAT  so that              you can competently and confidently take the GMAT test in a timed-environment, and achieve a score of better than 700.

Related subjects:  Education                 The  SAT Reasoning Test  (formerly  Scholastic Aptitude Test  and  Scholastic Assessment Test ) is a   standardized test for   college admissions in the  United States . The SAT is owned, published, and developed by the   College Board, a   non-profit organization in the United States, and was once developed, published, and scored by the   Educational Testing Service (ETS). ETS now administers the exam.                      Map of states according to preferred exam of 2006 high school graduates. States in orange had more students taking the SAT than the   ACT.                          The current SAT Reasoning Test is administered in about four hours and costs $43 ($68 International), excluding late fees. Since the SAT's introduction in  1901 , its name and scoring has changed several times. In 2005, the test was renamed as ""SAT Reasoning Test"" with possible scores from 600 to 2400 combining test results from three 800-point sections (math, critical reading, and writing), along with other subsections scored separately. Function         The College Board states that the SAT measures critical thinking skills that are needed for academic success in   college. They state that the SAT assesses how well the test takers analyze and solve problems—skills they learned in school that they will need in college. The SAT is typically taken by   high school   juniors and   seniors. Specifically, the College Board states that use of the SAT in combination with high school grade point average (GPA) provides a better indicator of success in college than high school grades alone, as measured by college freshman   GPA. Various studies conducted over the lifetime of the SAT show a statistically significant increase in  correlation  of high school grades and freshman grades when the SAT is factored in. There are substantial differences in funding, curricula, grading, and difficulty among U.S. secondary schools due to American   federalism, local control, and the prevalence of private, distance, and   home schooled students.   ACT/SAT scores are intended to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local data—such as course work, grades, and class rank—in a national perspective. Historically, the SAT has been more popular among colleges in the coasts and the ACT more popular in the Midwest and South. There are some colleges that require the ACT to be taken for college course placement, and a few schools that do not accept the SAT at all.  Structure         SAT consists of three major sections: Critical   Reading,  Mathematics , and  Writing . Each section receives a score on the scale of 200–800. All scores are multiples of 10. Total scores are calculated by adding up scores of the three sections. Each major section is divided into three parts. There are 10 sub-sections, including an additional 25-minute experimental or ""equating"" section that may be in any of the three major sections. The experimental section is used to   normalize questions for future administrations of the SAT and does not count toward the final score. The test contains 3 hours and 45 minutes of actual timed sections, although most administrations, including orientation, distribution of materials, and completion of the biographical sections, run about 4 hours (10–25 minutes per sub-section) long.                      Intentionally blank page in the style used in the SAT.                          Critical Reading         The Critical Reading, formerly verbal, section of the SAT is made up of three scored sections, two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, with varying types of questions, including sentence completions and questions about short and long reading passages. Critical Reading sections normally begin with 5 to 8 sentence completion questions; the remainder of the questions are focused on the reading passages. Sentence completions generally test the student's   vocabulary and understanding of sentence structure and organization by requiring the student to select one or two words that best complete a given sentence. The bulk of the Critical Reading questions is made up of questions regarding reading passages, in which students read short excerpts on social sciences, humanities, physical sciences, or personal narratives and answer questions based on the passage. Certain sections contain passages asking the student to compare two related passages; generally, these consist of short reading passages as well as longer passages. Since this is a timed test, the number of questions about each passage is proportional to the length of the passage. Mathematics         The  Mathematics  section of SAT is widely known as Quantitative Section. Mathematics section consists of three scored sections. There are two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, as follows:          One of the 25-minute sections is entirely multiple choice, with 20 questions. The other 25-minute section contains eight multiple choice questions and 10 grid-in questions. The shorter section is all multiple choice, with only 16 questions.         Notably, the SAT has done away with   quantitative comparison questions on the math section, leaving only questions with straightforward   symbolic or  numerical  answers. Since the quantitative comparison questions were well-known for their deceptive nature—often turning on the student's recognition of a single exception to a rule or pattern—this choice has been equated to a philosophical shift away from ""trickery"" and toward ""straight math"" on the SAT. Also, many test experts have attributed this change, like the addition of the new writing section, to an attempt to make the SAT more like the   ACT. Indeed, there is a correlation between ACT scores and SAT scores. Writing         The writing section of the SAT, based on but not directly comparable to the old SAT II subject test in writing, includes multiple choice questions and a brief essay. The multiple choice questions include error identification questions, sentence improvement questions, and paragraph improvement questions. Error identification and sentence improvement questions test the student's knowledge of grammar, presenting an awkward or grammatically incorrect sentence; in the error identification section, the student must locate the word producing the source of the error or indicate that the sentence has no error, while the sentence improvement section requires the student to select an acceptable fix to the awkward sentence. The paragraph improvement questions test the student's understanding of logical organization of ideas, presenting a poorly written student essay and asking a series of questions as to what changes might be made to best improve it. The essay section, which is always administered as the first section of the test, is 25 minutes long. All essays must be in response to a given prompt. The prompts are broad and often philosophical and are designed to be accessible to students regardless of their educational and social backgrounds. For instance, test takers may be asked to expound on such ideas as their opinion on the value of work in human life or whether technological change also carries negative consequences to those who benefit from it. No particular essay structure is required, and the College Board accepts examples ""taken from [the student's] reading, studies, experience, or observations."" Two trained readers assign each essay a score between 1 and 6, where a score of 0 is reserved for essays that are blank, off-topic, non-English, not written with a Number 2 pencil, or considered illegible after several attempts at reading. The scores are summed to produce a final score from 2 to 12 (or 0). If the two readers' scores differ by more than one point, then a senior third reader decides. The essay score accounts for roughly 30% of the writing score; the multiple choice component accounts for roughly 70%. Questions         Most of the questions on the SAT are   multiple choice; all multiple-choice questions have five answer choices, one of which is correct. The questions of each section of the same type are generally ordered by difficulty. However, an important exception exists: Questions that follow the long and short reading passages are organized chronologically, rather than by difficulty. Ten of the questions in one of the math sub-sections are not multiple choice. They instead require the test taker to bubble in a number in a four-column grid. The questions are weighted equally. For each correct answer, one raw point is added. For each incorrect answer one-fourth of a point is deducted. No points are deducted for incorrect math grid-in questions. This ensures that a student's   mathematically expected gain from guessing is zero. The final score is derived from the raw score; the precise conversion chart varies between test administrations. The SAT therefore recommends only making educated guesses, that is, when the test taker can eliminate at least one answer he or she thinks is wrong. Without eliminating any answers one's probability of answering correctly is 20%. Eliminating one wrong answer increases this probability to 25%; two, a 33.3% probability; three, a 50% probability of choosing the correct answer and thus earning the full point for the question.

The test is typically offered on the first Saturday of the month for the November, December, May, and June administrations. In other countries, the SAT is offered on the same dates as in the  United States  except for the first spring test date (i.e., March or April), which is not offered. In 2006, the test was taken 1,465,744 times. Candidates may either take the SAT Reasoning Test or up to three   SAT Subject Tests on any given test date, except the first spring test date, when only the SAT Reasoning Test is offered. Candidates wishing to take the test may register online at the College Board's website, by mail, or by telephone, at least three weeks before the test date. The SAT Subject Tests are all given in one large book on test day. Therefore, it is actually immaterial which tests, and how many, the student signs up for; with the possible exception of the language tests with listening, the student may change his or her mind and take  any  tests, regardless of his or her initial sign-ups. Students who choose to take more subject tests than they signed up for will later be billed by College Board for the additional tests and their scores will be withheld until the bill is paid. Students who choose to take fewer subject tests than they signed up for are not eligible for a refund. The SAT Reasoning Test costs $43 ($68 International). For the Subject tests, students pay a $20 Basic Registration Fee and $8 per test (except for language tests with listening, which cost $20 each). The College Board makes fee waivers available for low income students. Additional fees apply for late registration, standby testing, registration changes, scores by telephone, and extra score reports (beyond the four provided for free). Candidates whose religious beliefs prevent them from taking the test on a Saturday may request to take the test on the following Sunday, except for the October test date in which the Sunday test date is eight days after the main test offering. Such requests must be made at the time of registration and are subject to denial. Students with verifiable disabilities, including physical and learning disabilities, are eligible to take the SAT with accommodations. The standard time increase for students requiring additional time due to learning disabilities is 50%. Raw scores, scaled scores, and percentiles         Students receive their online score report approximately three weeks after administration of the test (six weeks for mailed, paper scores), with each section graded on a scale of 200–800 and two sub scores for the writing section: the essay score and the multiple choice sub score. In addition to their score, students receive their   percentile (the percentage of other test takers with lower scores). The raw score, or the number of points gained from correct answers and lost from incorrect answers (ranges from just under 50 to just under 60, depending upon the test), is also included. Students may also receive, for an additional fee, the Question and Answer Service, which provides the student's answer, the correct answer to each question, and online resources explaining each question. The corresponding percentile of each scaled score varies from test to test—for example, in 2003, a scaled score of 800 in both sections of the SAT Reasoning Test corresponded to a percentile of 99.9, while a scaled score of 800 in the SAT Physics Test corresponded to the 94th percentile. The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are because of the content of the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to intensive study (often in the form of an   AP, which is relatively more difficult), and only those who know they will perform well tend to take these tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores. The percentiles that various SAT scores for college-bound seniors correspond to are summarized in the following chart:                    Percentile           Score, 1600 Scale  (official, 2006)           Score, 2400 Scale  (official, 2006)                             99.93/99.98*           1600           2400                             99+           ≥1550           ≥2300                             99           ≥1480           ≥2200                             98           ≥1450           ≥2140                             97           ≥1420           ≥2100                             88           ≥1380           ≥1900                             83           ≥1280           ≥1800                             78           ≥1200           ≥1770                             72           ≥1150           ≥1700                             61           ≥1090           ≥1600                             48           ≥1010           ≥1500                             36           ≥950           ≥1400                             15           ≥810           ≥1200                             4           ≥670           ≥1010                             1           ≥520           ≥790                             * The percentile of the perfect score was 99.98 on the 2400 scale and 99.93 on the 1600 scale.                          The older SAT (before 1995) had a very high ceiling. In any given year, only seven of the million test-takers scored above 1580. A score above 1580 was equivalent to the 99.9995 percentile. SAT-ACT score comparisons         Although there is no official conversion chart between the SAT and its biggest rival, the   ACT, the College Board released an unofficial chart based on results from 103,525 test takers who took both tests between October 1994 and December 1996   here; however, both tests have changed since then. Several colleges have also issued their own charts. The following is based on the University of California's conversion chart.

Although those taking the test came from a variety of backgrounds, approximately one third were from   New York,   New Jersey, or   Pennsylvania. The majority of those taking the test were from private schools, academies, or endowed schools. About 60% of those taking the test applied to   Columbia University. The test contained sections on English,  French ,  German ,  Latin ,   Greek, history, mathematics,  chemistry , and  physics . The test was not multiple choice, but instead was evaluated based on essay responses as ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""doubtful,"" ""poor,"" or ""very poor.""  1926 test         The first administration of the SAT occurred on   June 23,  1926 , when it was known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test. This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of   definitions,  arithmetic , classification, artificial language,   antonyms, number series,   analogies,   logical inference, and paragraph reading. It was administered to over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to   Yale University and   Smith College respectively.  The test was paced considerably quickly, with 315 questions asked in only a little over an hour and a half. 1928 and 1929 tests         In 1928 the number of verbal sections was reduced to 7, and the time limit was increased to slightly under two hours. In 1929 the number of sections was again reduced, this time to 6. These changes in part loosened time constraints on test-takers. Math was eliminated entirely for these tests, instead focusing only on verbal ability. 1930 test and 1936 changes         In  1930  the SAT was first split into the verbal and math sections, a structure that would continue through  2004 . The verbal section of the 1930 test covered a more narrow range on content than its predecessors, examining only antonyms, double definitions (somewhat similar to sentence completions), and paragraph reading. In  1936 , analogies were re-added. Between 1936 and  1946 , students had between 80 and 115 minutes to answer 250 verbal questions (over a third of which were on antonyms). The mathematics test introduced in 1930 contained 100 free response questions to be answered in 80 minutes, and focused primarily on speed. From 1936 to  1941 , like the 1928 and 1929 tests, the mathematics section was eliminated entirely. When the mathematics portion of the test was re-added in  1942 , it consisted of multiple choice questions. 1946 test and associated changes         Paragraph reading was eliminated from the verbal portion of the SAT in 1946, and replaced with reading comprehension, and ""double definition"" questions were replaced with sentence completions. Between 1946 and  1957  students were given 90 to 100 minutes to complete 107 to 170 verbal questions. Starting in  1958  time limits became more stable, and for 17 years, until  1975 , students had 75 minutes to answer 90 questions. In  1959  questions on data sufficiency were introduced to the mathematics section, and then replaced with quantitative comparisons in  1974 . In 1974 both verbal and math sections were reduced from 75 minutes to 60 minutes each, with changes in test composition compensating for the decreased time. 1980 test and associated changes         The inclusion of the ""Strivers"" Score study was implemented. This study was introduced by The Educational Testing Service, which administers the SAT, and has been conducting research on how to make it easier for minorities and individuals who suffer from social and economic barriers. The original ""Strivers"" project, which was in the research phase from 1980 - 1994, awarded a test-taker who was identified as a minority an additional 10 - 200 points, depending on the race and gender. The belief was that this would give minorities a better chance at being accepted in to a college of higher standard, i.e. an Ivy League school. In 1992, the Strivers Project was leaked to the public; as a result the Strivers Project was terminated in 1993. After Federal Courts heard arguments from the ACLU, NAACP and the Educational Testing Service, the courts ordered the study to alter its data collection process, stating that only the age, race and zip code could be used to determine the test-takers eligibility for ""Strivers"" points. These changes were introduced to the SAT effective in 1994. 1994 changes         In  1994  the verbal section received a dramatic change in focus. Among these changes were the removal of   antonym questions, and an increased focus on passage reading. The mathematics section also saw a dramatic change in 1994, thanks in part to pressure from the   National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. For the first time since 1935, the SAT asked some non-multiple choice questions, instead requiring students to supply the answers. 1994 also saw the introduction of calculators into the mathematics section for the first time in the test's history. The mathematics section introduced concepts of probability, slope, elementary statistics, counting problems, median and mode. The average score on the 1994 modification of the SAT I was usually around 1000 (500 on the verbal, 500 on the math). The most selective schools in the United States (for example, those in the   Ivy League) typically had SAT averages exceeding 1400 on the old test. 2005 changes         In 2005, the test was changed again, largely in response to criticism by the   University of California system. Because of issues concerning ambiguous questions, especially   analogies, certain types of questions were eliminated (the analogies from the verbal and quantitative comparisons from the Math section). The test was made marginally harder, as a corrective to the rising number of perfect scores. A new writing section, with an essay, based on the former SAT II Writing Subject Test, was added, in part to increase the chances of closing the opening gap between the highest and midrange scores. Other factors included the desire to test the writing ability of each student in a personal manner; hence the essay. The New SAT (known as the SAT Reasoning Test) was first offered on   March 12,   2005, after the last administration of the ""old"" SAT in January of 2005. The Mathematics section was expanded to cover three years of high school mathematics. The Verbal section's name was changed to the Critical reading section. Name changes and recentered scores         In 1990, because of uncertainty about the SAT's ability to function as an   intelligence test, the name was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test. Finally, in 1994, the name was changed to simply SAT (with the   letters not standing for anything). Now the test is commonly referred to as the SAT Reasoning Test. The scoring categories are now the following: Reading, Math, Writing, and Essay. The essay has its own score now. The test scoring was initially scaled to make 500 the mean score on each section with a  standard deviation  of 100. As the test grew more popular and more students from less rigorous schools began taking the test, the average dropped to about 428 Verbal and 478 Math. The SAT was ""recentered"" in 1995, and the average ""new"" score became again close to 500. Scores awarded after 1994 and before October 2001 are officially reported with an ""R"" (e.g. 1260R) to reflect this change. Old scores may be recentered to compare to 1995 to present scores by using official College Board tables , which in the middle ranges add about 70 points to Verbal and 20 or 30 points to Math. In other words, current students have a 100 (70 plus 30) point advantage over their parents. Scoring problems of October 2005 tests         In March of 2006, it was announced that a small percentage of the SATs taken in October 2005 had been scored incorrectly due to the test papers being moist and not scanning properly, and that some students had received substantially erroneous scores. The College Board announced they would change the scores for the students who were given a lower score than they earned, but at this point many of those students had already applied to colleges using their original scores. The College Board decided not to change the scores for the students who were given a higher score than they earned. A lawsuit was filed in 2005 by about 4,400 students who received an incorrect low score on the SAT. The class-action suit was settled in August 2007 when The College Board and another company that administers the college-admissions test announced they would pay $2.85 million to over 4,000 students. Under the agreement each student can either elect to receive $275 or submit a claim for more money if he or she feels the damage was even greater. Criticism         Bias         A famous example of alleged bias in the SAT I is the   oarsman-  regatta analogy question. The object of the question was to find the pair of terms that have the relationship most similar to the relationship between ""runner"" and ""marathon"". The correct answer was ""oarsman"" and ""regatta"".                                                                             As depicted above, SAT scores vary according to race, income, and parental educational background.                          The question relied upon students knowing the meaning of the two terms, referring to a sport popular with the wealthy. Fifty-three percent (53%) of white students correctly answered the question, and 22% of black students did. Analogy questions have since been replaced by short reading passages. Dropping SAT         A few   liberal arts colleges have responded to this criticism by joining the   SAT optional movement. These colleges do not require the SAT for admission. In a 2001 speech to the   American Council on Education,   Richard C. Atkinson, then president of the   University of California, urged dropping the SAT Reasoning Test as a college admissions requirement:          ""Anyone involved in education should be concerned about how overemphasis on the SAT is distorting educational priorities and practices, how the test is perceived by many as unfair, and how it can have a devastating impact on the self-esteem and aspirations of young students. There is widespread agreement that overemphasis on the SAT harms American education.""         In response to threats by the University of California to drop the SAT as an admission requirement, the College Entrance Examination Board announced the restructuring of the SAT, to take effect in March 2005, as detailed above. Essay         In 2005,   MIT Writing Director   Les Perelman plotted essay length versus essay score on the new SAT from released essays and found a high correlation between them. After studying 23 graded essays he found that the longer the essay was, the higher the score. He also discovered that several of these essays were full of factual errors. However, the official SAT guide for scorers state that the essays should be scored according to their quality of writing and not factual accuracy. The National Council of Teachers of English also criticize the 25-minute writing section of the test, arguing that the basic principles of writing encourage the revision of written material several times. They say that the amount of time allowed for the test pushes schools to develop a formulaic system of writing.

clueweb09-enwp01-84-19480	"                     SAT Subject Tests          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  SAT Subject test )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search            The  SAT Subject Tests  is the collective name for 20  multiple choice   standardized tests  given on individual subjects. A student typically chooses which tests to take depending upon  college  entrance requirements for the schools in which he or she is planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as  Achievement Tests , and until January 2005, they were known as  SAT IIs ; they are still commonly known by these names. Every test is now a one-hour timed test. Historically, the exception to the one-hour time was the writing test, which was divided into a 20-minute  essay  question and a 40-minute multiple choice section; it was discontinued after January 2005.   A student may take up to three SAT Subject Tests on any given date. Most SAT subject tests are offered on the same dates as the regular  SAT , except for the March administration. The language tests with listening are generally available only once a year, in November. A calendar of test dates and registration deadlines can be found on  The College Board 's official website ( here ).

[ edit ]   Scoring and admissions   Each individual test is scored on a scale of 200 to 800; however, some of the tests are scored on such generous curves that it is impossible to get a 200; for example, on the Mathematics Level 2 test if someone gets every question wrong, he/she gets a score of about 310 depending on the version of the test. [ 4 ]  The one and only exception was the ELPT, which was scored on a scale of 901 to 999.   Prior to the first administration of the new SAT (which includes the writing section) in March 2005, some highly selective colleges required applicants to take three SAT Subject tests, including the writing test and two other tests of the applicant's choosing, in addition to the SAT. However, with writing now a standard component of the SAT I, most selective colleges recommend applicants to submit scores for any two SAT Subject tests. Engineering schools typically require Chemistry or Physics and prefer Math Level 2. A handful of the most competitive schools, such as  Harvard University  and  Princeton University , [ 5 ]  still require three Subject tests in addition to the three sections of the SAT. It is important to consult the school's website to find out more information about Subject test requirements.   Schools also vary with regard to their SAT Subject test requirements of students submitting scores for the  ACT  in place of the SAT: some schools consider the ACT an alternative to both the SAT and some SAT Subject tests, whereas others accept the ACT but require SAT Subject tests as well. Information about a school's specific test requirements can typically be found on its official website.   The College Board will send all scores on all SAT tests taken, including Subject Tests, whenever a student requests scores be sent to a school; the student cannot select which Subject Tests to send to a given institution.   In October 2002, the College Board decided to drop the ""score choice"" option for exams. They figured that it benefited wealthier students taking the exam who could afford to take it multiple times. Score choice means that scores are not released to colleges until the student approves the score (after seeing it).  [ 6 ]   As of the March 2009 test, test takers now have the ability to choose whether or not to send scores thus reinstating the ""score choice"" option.  [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Answer sheet   The answer sheet has room for 115 answers. 1-100 are Standard Multiple choice questions and 101-115 for 'relationship analysis questions', which are only used for the Chemistry exam. No test has more than 95 questions. The biology test is the only test to use 96-100; questions 1-60 are common to both the E and M tests, in addition, the E uses 61-80, and the M uses 81-100.

MLIC GMAT/GRE PREP ADVANTAGE:  Best training materials, best trainers, most training hours, and the best training methodology                    back to              top          WHY MLIC GMAT PREP COURSE IS THE BEST TRAINING OPTION :                      MLIC GMAT COURSES -- INDUSTRY-LEADING, SKILL-ENHANCING, AND GOAL-DRIVEN. SERIOUS COACHING, NOT SEMINARS. WE TRAIN YOU, NOT JUST FEED YOU SOME USELESS TRICKS    WHY ARE THE MLICETS GMAT TEST PREP COURSES             BETTER  than the GMAT prep courses offered by Kaplan GMAT Prep (KAPTEST), Princeton              Review, Veritas Prep, Manhattan GMAT, Manhattan Review, 800Score.com, Testmasters,Powerscore, and others? Also, VERITAS PREP's and MGMAT's deceptions uncovered.    MLIC GMAT advantage -- Best training materials, best MBA instructors,best training methodology, and the most training hours of any GMAT course out there.   For starters, we 'coach and train' you in the GMAT assessment areas, using the  latest GMAT problems . Our goal-driven GMAT preparation courses will teach you relevant concepts and procedures required to shoot for and achieve a GMAT score of better than 700. Unlike the tutorial sessions run by Kaplan GMAT, Veritas Elite Prep , Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, and Manhattan Review, the MLICETS GMAT coaching courses will show you what it takes to achieve a GMAT score of better than 700 and make you demonstrate to your instructor that you have acquired and honed the skills in all Score-critical concept and procedural areas of GMAT, and provide customized help in your areas of weakness. We at  MLIC  do not leave it up to you to learn on your own as Kaplan GMAT, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, and other me-too courses do.  We compel you to show us that you have learned and honed the GMAT-critical procedural and conceptual skills required to get a GMAT score in the 90th percentile or better. We at MLIC are so confident that our coaching methodology is effective that we are willing to back up our training with the industry-leading GMAT Score Guarantee.    If you are not convinced that MLICETS is the best GMAT preparation option that is available to you consider this: we offer  the most GMAT training course hours  of any GMAT or GRE prep course out there: The MLICETS Turbo-Prep GMAT course              features 40 hours of pre-GMAT-course work in the GMAT assessment areas,              42 hours of in-classGMAT-coaching support, and at least 40 hours of post-GMAT-course training involving additional               practice tests, and customzied exercises - For a whopping 120 hours of serious, no-nonsense GMAT training.  Compare this to the pitiful 18 to 27 hours of useless Q&A sessions offered by Kaplan Prep (KAPTEST), Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Manhattan Review, and other me-too GMAT prep programs. Veritas Elite GMAT prep company claims to offer between 36 and 42 hours of in-class training but have been known to scale back the number of in-class hours, as it did recently in Cincinnati, OH because its part-time instructor could not show up on Day 1. Do not be stood up; be wise and be trained -- choose MLIC.    All the other GMAT prep courses, such as the              GMAT prep classes offered by Kaplan GMAT (KapTest), Princeton Review, Manhattan Review, Manhattan GMAT, Powerscore, Testmasters, and others, are              essentially  Self-study  GMAT courses : They              throw a bunch of less-than-half-decent GMAT-like books at you, show you some strategies and tricks during their in-class sessions, and ask you to work on your own for the most part. Veritas Prep, even though it claims to offer 42 hours of in-class sessions including about 3.5 hours of break during the sessions, does not require you to attend all its sessions and is, in essence, a program that relies on you to work through its prep materials on your own.     KAPLAN GMAT TEST PREP  courses for the GMAT run typically 18 to 24 hours and use part-time student instructors some of whom may not have taken the actual GMAT. Kaplan Prep does not use real GMAT questions but instead uses its own 'made up' questions that rely excessively on cheap tricks that do not work most of the time, if at all. Kaplan instructors have been known to give the stock reply that 'Kaplan policy does not allow to teach you those problems or answer those questions.'  The adaptive format the GMAT is not conducive to use of test-taking skills that rely on 'back-solving' and on 'tricks'. If you take away the 6 hours spent on 'practice tests' at the beginning and at the end of the 'course', the actual time spent in in-class sessions with Kaplan may not be more than 12 to 18 hours. Kaplan's ""computer lab' is a joke.  Rather than give you the CD containing the tests and having you take them at your home or office, Kaplan creates the illusion that it is actually providing value for your prep dollars by having you show up at its 'computer lab' to play with some useless tests. No one gets better by taking useless tests. MLIC actually  trains  you in GMAT assessment areas using questions appearing at high difficulty levels so that you can shoot for and reach a score of better than 700    PRINCETON REVIEW GMAT  GMAT courses typically run for 24 hours, and uses franchised outlets over which it may not have any direct control.  Princeton Review also relies on part-time instructors, most of whom are students who may not have taken the actual GMAT, and excessively relies on tricks to 'crack the GMAT'. Its training courses are meant to teach you at the level of 'Joe Blogg' and not at a level that is required to reach a score of better than 700. Princeton Review, like Kaplan Test prep, does not use the actual GMAT questions and trains you using some phony, made-up problems that are not representative of real GMaT questions. In short, Princeton Review GMAT course can actually do you more harm than good by letting you work on questions and passages that are not close to the real GMAT. Any company that charges you an arm and leg for 24 hours of useless tutorials such as the ones offered by PR must be doing itself a favor, not you a favor. Be wise. Choose MLIC GMAT prep.    MANHATTAN GMAT  prep course appears to be the biggest ""all-lime-and-salt-no-tequila' outfit out there, offering paltry 24 hours of tricks based tutoring for U$1,440 (after adjusting for the 3 hours of break during the 9-sessions) and relying on part-time instructors most of whom are non-MBA's (the instructor who  teaches  Manhattan GMAT course in New York City majored in linguistics and is an aspiring Hollywood screen-play writer; another instructor runs a puppy-mill from his bathroom). MGMAT has been known to switch your in-class registration to its pricey and useless virtual class if it cannot get sufficient number of people to enroll in its courses. Manhattan GMAT in-class sessions also appear to be disorganized;  the instructor hops from Data Sufficiency to Critical Reasoning to Sentence Correction, all in the same session.  Manhattan GMAT appears to rely on same training methodology as Kaplan and Princeton Review do, and merely teaches you some tricks, shows you  you some 'key' problems to explain its tricks, and then lets you go to work on your own in  clueless serendipity . When you show up for the next session, your homework tasks may not be reviewed, no question and answer session held, and the likely non-MBA instructor will move on to another round of amuse-bouche - moving from Reading Comprehension tricks to Problem solving to whatever the heck the instructor feels like. This methodology is not conducive to helping you develop a solid grip on the GMAT assessment areas, and cannot be effective.  Manhattan GMAT is the  only  company on the block that does NOT believe that its training methodology works so much so that it does   NOT  offer any sort of  guarantee  to back up its training.  In fact, Manhattan GMAT has the philosophy that if you did not do well on the test, then you are to blame for not controlling your nerves or for not applying its tricks. As Tate Shafer, one of the non-MBA instructors for MGMAT put it, if you did not do well after Manhattan GMAT training with its tricks, then you alone are to blame for the debacle. Manhattan GMAT appears to be a hyped up 'take the money and run' operation out there in the marketplace, blaming the 'victim'. Its potential instructors are 'trained' by 'sitting in on' the courses 'taught' by other instructors for the most part. Then they are required to do an audition to show that they can rattle out the talking points to be anointed 'instructors for MGMAT'. MGMAT also requires that its trainee instructors  GUEST-TEACH  a class, using YOU as the guinea-pig for the training of someone who may not even be hired. Do you want to be used as guinea-pig by a company that does not back up its GMAT training with any sort of post-course guarantees? MGMAT's claim that it hires only those who have scored in the 99th percentile on a GMAT test after rejecting 4 out of 5 aspirants sounds fraudulent. Firstly, 99th percentile scorers wanting to teach for MGMAT is not unlimited, and it does not have the luxury of rejecting 4 out of 5 aspiring teachers. Secondly, why are MGMAT's '99th percentile instructors' waiting for their gigs in Broadway or in Hollywood instead of pursuing MBA education at top-5 schools that will surely put them on the path to over $200,000 annual compensation? Let us do the math: MGMAT pays them, if they are 'hired',  $2,700 over a 9 week period, an average of $1,200 a month, which is not enough to pay the rent and buy Starbucks Coffee at the same time in Manhattan. Do you want to be taught by untrained, ill-qualified, and possibly some-months-behind-in-rent MGMAT instructors, when you shell out $1450 for its 24-hour long  dog-and-pony show  that passes for GMAT preparation? GMAT tests critical reasoning - Think critically and do not be suckered into buyng the phony claims by MGMAT. In sum, Manhattan GMAT offers you 24 hours of 'tricks' sessions,  does not believe in its training methodology to offer you a guarantee of any kind , offers no training in pacing critical to doing well in a time-critical GMAT environment, and features sloppy in-class training schedule that jerks you around from one GMAT section to another.  In Contrast, MLIC offers you 120-hours of goal-driven and skill-enhancing GMAT prep courses that are backed by the industry-leading GMAT Score Guarantee™.  Be informed. Be smart. Choose MLIC for serious, no-nonsense, kick-ass coaching in GMAT assessment areas.       VERITAS ELITE GMAT PREP  appears to be the  state of the art  in  ultimate deception . Its GMAT course materials are recycled retired GMAT questions, and its practice tests are the same ones you can buy from 800Score.com and Arco. Veritas Prep makes blatantly fraudulent claims on its website as explained below, and you should think twice before enrolling in its hyped up but useless GMAT courses. Veritas is also the only GMAT prep company that hires its 'instructors' mostly on the basis of resumes and phone interviews, and sends them out to teach with no formal training. Veritas recruits its part-time, hourly-rates-paid instructors by running ads in forums such as Craig's list  with the nonchalance of people who post ads for 'casual encounters' and in Vault job boards, and does not require that its instructors have 'teaching experience' (although it simply 'prefers it').  Veritas' training involves having its potential instructors watch a video of its methodology and then show up to 'teach' the class. MLIC believes that such a recruitment and training process used by Veritas Prep cannot ensure the quality of training that it claims that it delivers.  Veritas Prep also makes claims on its web-site that are  provably false . Let us expose four of those deceptions:    VERITAS DECEPTION 1 : Veritas Prep cleverly mentions '99th percentile' against the names of 'its faculty' appearing on its web-page. It does not state that they have scored in the 99th percentile on the GMAT. They could have scored in the 99th percentile on the SAT or on the LSAT or in one of the two assessment sections of the GMAT. The company's ad in Craig's list (that appears with the regularity of postings by a  pretentious  guy who cannot hold on to his girl friends) merely requires of its potential instructors a 99th percentile score in any of the GMAT sections. Participants who took Veritas Prep's GMAT course at Tysons Corner, Virginia recently have reported that the instructor who taught the course admitted to the class that he had not taken the GMAT ever. Other participants who took the Veritas course in Philadelphia recently have reported that the instructor who taught the course claimed that he had scored 740 on the GMAT, a score that is not sufficient to place him the 99th percentile. The instructor who taught the Cincinnati OH class that was canceled on the Day 1 because the instructor was a no-show stated that he had scored in the 80th percentile on the GMAT. Therefore, Veritas may be  fraudulently advertising  that its instructors have all scored in the 99th percentile on the GMAT. The 'faculty' list posted on its website may be outdated, and may include the names of 'instructors' who may not be currently 'teaching' for the company.    VERITAS DECEPTION 2 :  Veritas  falsely  characterizes its 'attendance policy' as 'score guarantee'.  The only GMAT prep company that offers GMAT Score Guarantee™ is MLICETS. Veritas Prep does not guarantee any score but merely allows you to retake its sessions once for any reason. Veritas Prep is also the only company that does not require you to attend all its training sessions. The only inference we can draw from this policy is that Veritas Prep is more interested in your money than in training you for the GMAT. If it were serious about training you, it would insist that you attend all its sessions. MLIC is the only GMAT prep company that actively teaches you the core concepts and procedures, makes you demonstrate that you have mastered them, and helps you improve in your areas of weakness by actively coaching you.  MLIC beats Veritas Prep hands down.   VERITAS DECEPTION 3 :  Veritas Prep blatantly makes a fraudulent claim about its association with GMAC®, (Graduate Management Admission Council), the body that administers the GMAT® test. Veritas Prep claims: ""Veritas works with the makers of the GMAT, the Graduate Management Admissions Council, and updates its course materials four times per year.""  GMAC® has flatly denied any such association and is proceeding against Veritas for this and other falsities represented on its website. Beware of phony and bald claims by Veritas. How could a company run by Yale MBA's and a JD from Missouri be obtuse enough to think that its fraud will not be caught? Any company that patently and blatantly makes false and fraudulent representations about its activities does not deserve your money or your time.  Beware of Veritas scams.  Choose industry-leading MLIC GMAT prep courses.    VERITAS DECEPTION 4 : Veritas Prep claims that if offers 13 practice tests. It basically 'buys' the tests from 800Score.com, Arco, and Cambridge tests,and uses some retired GMAT tests to 'arm' you with the practice tests. Of Veritas practice tests, 2 are available for free from GMAC at www.mba.com, 6 are available for $18.95 at Cambridge Ed, 5 are available for $24.95 at 800score.com, and 2 are available for about $5.00 from ARCO. There are no other eritaspractice tests aside from the ones available from these sources.   The tests created by 800Score.com are the same tests the company created 5 years ago, with no changes or updates. Veritas' claim that it 'updates' its tests 4 times a year is an utterly fraudulent statement, never mind its fraudulent claim of 'working with GMAC' for such updates. Veritas is the slimy spiderman caught with his hands in the cookie jar.  Any company that lies to get your business does not deserve your business. Beware of phony and fraudulenet claims by Veritas Prep. People who have been Veritas instructors report that they had to teach the 'same old same old' for years, with no updates. Veritas Prep pulls a fast one on you and does not deserve your business.    VERITAS CLASS SIZE -- NOT GOOD FOR YOU : Veritas classes may have as many as 15 to 25 persons in a class. MLIC classes will never have more than 10 persons per class. Crowded classrooms such as the ones offered by Veritas are not fair to you, especially when you pay $1,500. Beware of some of the false claims that Veritas makes on its website.    VERITAS PREP METHODOLOGY : Veritas Prep in-class sessions run like this: If the instructor shows up as scheduled, then he or she will do 'Q&A' for the first 20 to 30 minutes. Then he or she will teach you some strategies, and then have you work with him or her through some 'key' problems (usually about 8 to 10, sometimes as few as 4 to 5) and then you are dismissed to go home and do whatever the heck you want. There will not be any timed practice tests. There will be no effort made to identify and rectify your weaknesses in GMAT-critical areas. If you are willing to pay $1,500 for Veritas Prep course, you have a right to expect pro-active coaching support in GMAT-critical areas. Veritas Prep is also known to scale back its training hours to 'accommodate' its uncommitted, untrained, part-time instructors (Veritas Prep scaled back the weekend class hours from 21 to 18 at Cincinnati, OH to accommodate its instructor who could not show up on Day 1 of the course). When it comes to GMAT coaching, no one beats MLIC GMAT Turboprep™ course!    Veritas Prep does not provide any training in pacing or managing time during their in-class sessions. Any training that does not coach you in the pacing under time-critical GMAT testing environment is not doing you a service. MLIc trains you in pacing and gives you specific help in working under time-critical GMAT Conditions.     Be informed and be smart -- Choose MLIC GMAT prep courses that offer full-time MBA instructors, and proactively coaches you in GMAT-critical areas, and backs up its training with industry-leading GMAT Score Guarantee™ MLIC trains more people per month in the major markets than any other company -- Kaplan, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Veritas Prep, Testmasters, and others.    MLIC GMAT PREP ADVANTAGE --  GET TRAINED, NOT JUST FED SOME USELESS TRICKS .       In short, Kaplan GMAT prep, Princeton Review, Manhattan Review, Manhattan GMAT, 800Score.com, Testmasters, and Veritas Elite GMAT prep courses are nothing but              tutorial sessions that do not address your conceptual understanding              of or your weaknesses in the GMAT assessment areas. Only the  MLICETS GMAT prep courses  offered in New York (NYC), London England, Frankfurt Germany, Munich, Singapore, Mumbai, Sydney, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Philadelphia, and worldwide             are based on              patent-pending  CPSD methodology  that uniquely helps you develop strong GMAT-specific             conceptual understanding, trains you in efficient PROCEDURES for              maximizing your GMAT test-effectiveness in a timed-environment, gives you              works-every-time STRATEGIES for picking the Correct response to all GMAT problems each              and every time, and features real-time and GMAT-prep-course-participant-specific DIAGNOSTIC evaluation of your unique              weaknesses so that you can be helped to overcome your deficiencies in GMAT sections             and to shoot for a GMAT Score in the top 10%.  All our GMAT prep courses are              taught by full-time employees, who are MBA graduates from reputed Ivy League             Business Schools such as Columbia, Stanford, Harvard, London Business School, INSEAD, etc. and who are              required to take the GMAT test at least once each year and score in the              98th percentile or better each time.     Be sure to consider 5 factors in choosing your GMAT prep course:  (1) Quality of in-class instructions and Instructors -- MLIC beats all other me-too courses hands down in this department. MLIC GMAT courses are taught by MBA graduates who have extensive consulting and teaching experience, and who are required to take the GMAT at least once a year and score in the 98th percentile or better;  (2) In-Class Training hours --  MLIC offers 42 hours in their Turboprep GMAT courses and 24 hours in their 3-day intensive prep courses (which is more than offered by courses such as those offered by Kaplan).   (3) Quality of Study and Training materials  --  MLIC GMAT study guides and training materials are frequently updated to incorporate changes to the GMAT testing and to included newer types of GMAT questions appearing in the more recent tests. (4)  Committed support before, during, and after the in-class GMAT training -- MLIC offers a total of 120 hours of training and provides the committed and industry-leading support right from the moment you sign up to the time you take the test.  MLIC cares for you and wants to ensure that you achieve a score of at least 650; (5) Size of GMAT prep classes.  Veritas admits as many as they can register, and they claim that their classes in major cities have about 20 students.  Crowded groups do not allow instructors to identify weaknesses that the participants demonstrate. In contrast, MLIC courses are capped at 10 students, and most classes typically have 6-8 students per class. This small, compact group size allows us to apply our  CPSD  methodology and to  coach you  in the GMAT assessment areas. Enroll in the industry-leading MLICETS GMAT prep courses today!

VERITAS DECEPTIONS REDUX: Veritas Elite GMAT prep may scale back the number of training hours to accommodate its part-time, uncommitted instructors, as evidenced by an episode in Cincinnati, OH where Veritas Prep cut back the prep hours to 18 hours from 21 hours. In fact, the company sent email messages about the cancellation at 4 p.m. on the starting day of the class, and the 4 participants were stood up and left high and dry.   Veritas also fraudulently characterizes its 'retake the course for any reason' policy as a 'score guarantee'. Veritas Prep does not guarantee any specific GMAT score as MLIC does. Participants in Veritas' Weekend course in Vienna, VA have called to report that the instructor Ken Kleinfeld admitted to the clas that he had not taken the GMAT and that he was offering private tutoring sessions in North Carolina for SAT. Therefore, Veritas may also be fraudulently advertising that its instructors have all scored in the 99th percentile.  Be informed. Be smart. Choose MLIC GMAT prep courses for no-nonsense, kick-ass, and serious coaching in GMAT assessment areas.     Manhattan GMAT offers 24 hours of in-class 'tricks' sessions that are taught by mostly non-MBA instructors. Manhattan GMAT (MGMAT) is the only GMAT prep company that does not believe that its training methodology is effective and, consequently, does not offer any guarantee. MGMAT has also been known to switch your registration in a class-room GMAT course to its expensive but useless GMAT VIRTUAL COURSE, if sufficient number of people do not enroll in its courses.

CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE NEW REGISTRATION PROCEDURE FOR GMAT TESTING EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006 AND TO LEARN ABOUT THE IMPORTANT CHANGES TO GMAT TESTING AND GMAT TEST SCORE REPORTING EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006. NEW! STANFORD WILL ACCEPT GRE SCORES FOR MBA ADMISSIONS. HARVARD AND PRINCETON WILL NOT HAVE EARLY ADMISSION PROCEDURE STARTING 2007.             Stanford Graduate School of Business has announced that it will accept GRE or GMAT Scores for admission consideration starting with the Fall 2007 admission to its MBA class.  The reason appears to be that Stanford fears that minorities, women, and other ethnic groups may be deterred from Business School Admission and may seek alternative opportunities in law and medicine.  Rather than accept lower GMAT scores from these otherwise excluded groups, the school may have decided to accept GRE (Graduate Record Examination) Scores in order to maintain the School average and median scores for the GMAT.  Sounds like a clever move by Stanford GSB. We wonder whether other Graduate Schools of Business may follow suit or stick to their GMAT Score requirement.   Schools such as Harvard and Princeton University have already announced that they will eliminate early admission deadlines starting with the 2007 admission season.  The reason, again, appears to be that early admission deadlines favor strong candidates and leave the not-so-strong to be rejected when they apply late. Schools desire to have diversity, with participation by hitherto under-represented groups.      GMAT TEST REGISTRATION PROCEDURE FOR THE PEARSON VUE GMAT EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2006 AND IMPORTANT CHANGES TO GMAT TESTING AND GMAT SCORE REPORTING:   As far as GMAT TM  is concerned, ETS TM  is history and nobody is shedding any tears over the divorce. Pearson Vue and ACT is the new 800 pound gorilla in the room now and you better get used to it. You should know about some significant changes to GMAT testing and GMAT Test Score Reporting effective January 1, 2006. Pearson Vue is the Electronic testing divison of Pearson Educational Measurement (PEM) group, which administers several standardized tests including the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT-Reasoning Test) for College Board tm .  PEARSON EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT   is in the midst of unanticipated controversy surrounding its handling of the Scoring of the October 2005 SAT test. Some 4000 of the close to 500,000 test-takers received score reports that under-reported their total SAT Scores by as many as 400 out of 2400 points. Pearson ED, the group of which Pearson Vue is a member, said in a news release, ""SAT errors , which affected 4,000 students out of 495,000 who took that test, arose in part because of excessive moisture that caused the answer sheets to expand before they were scanned at its large Texas test-processing site. Another factor, PearsonEd said, was that its scanners were not picking up some lightly marked answers on the SAT answer sheet. The company, Pearson Educational Measurement (PEM), said in a statement that it was taking steps to make sure that ""this unfortunate situation will not happen again."" The latest news is that the executives at Pearson Educational Measurement are being called to testify before the U.S.A congress and explain why the scoring snafu did not make the testing company liable for messing up the admission and scholarship prospects for thousands of high-school graduates who took the SAT Reasoning test. What does this episode mean for the GMAT test-takers, who take the test on the computer? Nothing at all, we hope. The Scoring of computer adaptive or computer based test does not involve scanning sheets of paper that can stick to one another, and is more reliable.  (Are we guilty of assuming that the computer will not mess up the scoring by going berserk?) Let us keep our fingers crossed, shall we?     The paper and pencil format of GMAT is now dead. GMAT is administered worldwide in Computer Adaptive Testing format only.    Walk-in registrations for GMAT Testing are no longer permitted. Prior appointments must be made for GMAT testing in all testing centers. You can register to take the test by following the Telephonic registration procedure described below or by logging on to  GMAT TEST REGISTRATION ONLINE .    GMAT testing will not be offered on Saturdays and Sundays. Prometric used to offer GMAT testing on the Weekend days, including Sundays, in some cities. Pearson Vue would like to observe the Sabbath on Saturdays and Sundays. Register early in order to firm up your testing date.   GMAT test centers will no longer offer  scratch paper  during the GMAT testing. Instead, you will receive TWO dry erase  NOTE BOARDS and a PEN  that must be returned to the proctor at the GMAT test center when you leave or when you request a change of note-board. This is not a big deal but the earlier strategy of writing down (on scratch paper) formulas in Math will not work. You will be better off remembering all formulas and rules before you head to the testing center.   Test takers will no longer have to wait two to three weeks to get their official score reports by mail. Theyl be able to access their GMAT test score reports and send Official GMAT Score reports to schools through a secure online system.  GMAC will, at least for the forseeable future,  offer aper in a Pinchscore reports for those who don have access to a computer. GMAC (Graduate Management Admission Council) will not charge a fee for this paper-based score reporting service until further advise.    When ETS was administering the GMAT, the official GMAT Score Report contained the last three scores on the GMAT taken in the past. Effective January 2006, Pearson Vue and ACT will report  ALL GMAT SCORES  obtained during the past 5 years. This is a significant change because the Graduate Schools of Business will know your GMAT Score history during a longer period and because you will not be able to 'wipe off' the record a GMAT score that you want to forget about.   The format of the GMAT will remain the same, and the GMAT test will continue to measure your skill in the three different assessment areas: GMAT Quantitative Assessment, GMAT Verbal Assessment, and GMAT Analytical Writing Assessment. The Analytical Writing Section will continue to receive a separate score on the same scale between 2.0 and 6.0; the two adaptive sections on the GMAT, the quantitative assessment and the verbal assessment, will each receive scaled scores (0 to 60) as before, and the TOTAL score on the GMAT will remain 800. The GMAT test-scores on the multiple-choice, adaptive sections(Verbal and Quantitative Sections) will be based on the number of questions answered within the allotted time.    COSMETIC CHANGES   The GMATexam will go through some cosmetic changes as a result of the transition from ETSto Pearson Vue    The font and background color on the screen will change for the better   GMAT Reading Comprehension questions that point to specific sections of the reading passage will direct you to look at highlighted sections, not underlined sections as was the case in the past.    You will be given two (2) erasable noteboards and a pen when you enter the GMAT testing room instead of scratch paper and a pencil. The Verbal and Quantitative sections will remain Computer Adaptive, with the difficulty level of the GMATtesting constantly adjusting to your comfort level as demonstrated through your responses to the GMATquestions.

""I had taken the Kaplan GMAT prep before I took the MLIC prep class in Los Angeles. I found the Kaplan method insulting and insufficient to help me feel confident. The MLIC course, on the other hand, was intense, and helped me understand my weaknesses. I also received patient help from the instructor who was professional, highly skilled, and full of humor. All in all, a worthwhile investment.

""A friend of mine lent me his Manhattan GMAT study notes and I worked through them before I took the test in March 2008. I scored a 540 and was totally disapponted after having scored close to 700 on the MGMAT tests. Then, I enrolled in MLIC course for GMAT in New York in April 2008. When I received the pre-course assignments that included the study guides, I was struck by the detail and depth of coverage of GMAT concepts and test-taking procedures that were included in their prep materials. My score improved to 720 after taking the MLIC class in Manhattan. I strongly recommend the MLIC GMAT prep and would like to add this caveat:  Their pre-course assignments take about 60-70 hours, not 40 hours as they had claimed. Allow sufficient time to work through them before the class.           --  Erika Sweeney , GMAT PREP Course, New York, April  2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 06/08 .""

In fact, I received the same topic for the argument essay that we discussed during the prep class, and your quantitative training in the areas of sequences, coordinate geometry, and probability were of great help when I took the test. I also found your training for the sentence correction extremely useful: I learnt that sentence correction on the GMAT is not only about grammar and idiom rules but also about rules of logic. MLIc prep is the best.           --  Qamar Toor  , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, New York, April 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 05/08 .""

My major weakness was in the Verbal sections and MLIC's strategies for eliminating answer choices by classifying them into hit list categories helped me with a scaled score of 42 in the verbal section.

The biggest difference I found between the Manhattan GMAT course and the MLIC Turboprep course is this: Manhattan GMAT study materials do not cover the GMAT concepts as thoroughly as MLIC study guides do. Secondly, Manhattan GMAT makes you work through the OG 10, which contains retired GMAT problems.  The actual test is very different from the types covered in the official Guide for GMAT review. What I liked best about MLIC course was their study guides and their strategies for answer selection particularly in the verbal section.

When I signed up to do your turboprep class, I found what I needed but did not realize: a guided tour of the various assessment areas. The in-class instructor was brilliant, and showed us how the different areas of the GMAT are about the same logical reasoning skills. The drilling in procedural aspects of the Gmat, especially in data sufficiency, and the hit list approach to eliminating answer choices gave me the effective tools I needed to do well on this test. I am happy to report a score of 740 on the Gmat exam which I took 10 days after your class. The score is sufficient to make me competitive at INSEAD. Your prep course works.

Your GMAT course is the best for the following reasons:  (1) your study materials are the most thorough I have seen of any prep materials for the GMAT I have worked through; (2) The quality of in-class training was outstanding. The instructor was knowledgeable and patient; and (3) the course had a great structure, with the pre-class training assignments providing the required exposure to the concepts tested on the GMAT.

""Following your GMAT Turboprep course in Manhattan, I took the GMAT on June 27th, and scored a 680 (a huge 230 point improvement from the 450 I was making in the practice tests after I took the Veritas Elite prep course), landing myself in the 89th percentile. I also scored a  5.5 on the AWA section for 87th percentile ranking. Your GMAT prep course was a major factor in my success, and I must thank you for the thorough preparation you offered. I believe that I now have a competitive shot at admission to Columbia Business school.     As you are aware, I took the Veritas Elite GMAT course in Washington D.C. in Oct/Nov. 2005, and I felt that the Veritas Elite  Prep course lacked the necessary tools and methodology that could help me successfully prepare for the GMAT test.  When I first received your pre-class GMAT training files, I realized that your GMAT course was undoubtedly better than that offered by Veritas Elite! Although the majority of the information i had studied did not show up on the test, I felt prepared to deal with any problem that could have been thrown at me.  Veritas only prepared me for the most common problems which could be asked.  I also want to let you know that the incredible detail you pack into each GMAT study and training file allowed me to prepare for each GMAT section in the required depth.  Veritas Prep just put out some stuff out there and forced you to memorize concepts, hoping its crash course would provide enough of the tools necessary to solve most of the problems.   Veritas prep materials also lacked the depth and quality of training that MLIC offered. I strongly recommend MLIC GMAT prep course to anyone serious about getting a score in the 90th percentile range. Thanks again.

After scoring 570 on the GMAT in my first attempt, I researched on the Internet GMAT prep courses and enrolled in the GMAT prep class offered by an American testpreparation Company, MLIC, New York. MLIC GMAT preparation course, besides offering excellent GMAT study and GMAT training materials, also reinforces the learning process with original GMAT questions. The individual attention received from dedicated instructor in the MLIC GMAT class helps one overcome his or her weakness in Mathematics and in Verbal areas of GMAT. Result: I scored 670 on the GMAT.

WHAT IS GMAT® CAT?                  GMAT® , acronym for  G raduate  M anagement  A dmission  T est, is administered by Pearson Vue® on behalf of GMAC® and is required by all  G raduate  S chools of  B usiness for admission purposes.               The GMAT, according to  GMAC                (Graduate Management Admission Council that owns the trademarks GMAT®  and GMAT CAT®, is one measure of your ability to               complete sucessfully the first year of graduate study program (MBA degree program) at a Graduate School of Business.However, effective January 2006, the paper and pencil version of the GMAT test is no longer offered anywhere in the world. GMATis              administered in a CAT(Computer Adaptive) format in which the GMAT test'adapts' the              difficulty level of GMAT questions to your GMAT-specific 'comfort level', with 'higher              difficulty level GMAT questions' carrying higher GMAT raw scores (GMAT Scaled              Scores) than do 'lower difficulty level' GMAT questions. The              GMAT tests your Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning skills, and your ability (i) to process information in context, (ii) to make necessarily true and probable interpretations of information presented, (iii) to stay focused on the specifics, and (iv) to test different scenarios for consistency of decisions. The GMAT test also is about your ability to determine whether GMAT sentences are logically, clearly, correctly, and effectively written.  The GMAT  has three              assessment areas:    AWA  (Analytical Writing Assessment)              that requires you to write Two essays, one analyzing an Issue              and the other analyzing an Argument. This first essay section on the GMAT is not 'adaptive'              and receives a separate score of between 0 and 6.   GMAT Quantitative Assessment  is the first              of the two 'adaptive' sections on the GMAT and follows the Analytical Writing section, and requires that you              answer 37 questions in problem solving and in Data Sufficiency in 75 minutes (nearly 1/4 of the questions will not be scored). Following the GMAT Quantitative section, you will be required to work on the last 'adaptive' section on              the GMAT is  Verbal              Assessment , which requires that you answer 41              questions in 75 minutes. The GMAT Verbal assessment includes three sections: GMAT Critical Reasoning, GMAT Sentence Correction, and GMAT Reading Comprehension. GMAT adaptive sections also include              experimental questions, at least 9 in GMAT Quantitative assessment and 11              in GMAT Verbal assessment. The two adaptive sections on the GMAT receive a combined             score of between 200 and 800. Most A-List Business Schools rated in the top-10 will              require a GMAT test score of at least 680 in order for you to be              competitive. (the percentile rankings corresponding to scores of between 600 and 640 have decreased in the past few years). Your best chance for success lies in your ability to              take the GMAT exam at the high difficulty level throughout and to score better than 700. The MLICETS GMAT prep              courses offer the best GMAT test training, using the  most recent and high difficulty level questions that are live on the GMAT  so that              you can competently and confidently take the GMAT test in a timed-environment, and achieve a score of better than 700.

CONTENTS OF THIS SITE       Testimonials      COURSE STRUCTURE         GMAT Score Guarantee™     MLIC is the best GMAT prep option             TESTIMONIALS ABOUT MLIC GMAT COURSES   ""Half way through the Veritas prep program and frustrated with the haphazard training methodology used by Chris, I enrolled in the MLIC GMAT prep course in Manhattan. Right from the time I received the precourse assignments, I could already see why MLIC was far superior. The training guides provided by MLIC were the best I have worked through, and the in-class instructions were the most thorough:  Veritas instructor would randomly choose a few problems from their workbooks and OG, and hurriedly show how they would be solved. After class assignments were hardly reviewed, and I had to work on my own in clueless frustration. In contrast, MLIC instructor covered all concept areas, strategies, and explained all in-class tests and home assignments. Some of the critical areas such as sequences and conditional probability were never covered in any dept in the Veritas program whereas MLIC did a great job. MLIC prep was worth the time and additional money I paid for it.          --  SH, New York Turboprep GMAT course    ""I was working through some nondescript books for GMAT and was getting frustrated, not knowing what specifically I needed to know to ace this test before I registered in your course. Your course gave me a structure that was important to my learning style, and got me prepped in all the maths basics that I had initially struggled with. Your prework files (that took me 70 hours to work through against your claim of 50 hours) was nevertheless useful in giving me a brushup on the basics in maths and getting me ready for the programme. Your inclass training was equally effective. I scored an impressive 680 after your training. Cheers, MLIC.""          --  Colin Cowdrey, London Turboprep course  ""I took your turboprep course after participating in Veritas gmat course, and found your training exponentially better. The study materials were far superior and covered the gmat sections more comprehensively, and your in-class instructions were a thousand times better than I had seen with Veritas. For example, Veritas showed a few sample problems during the in-class sessions and let me work on my own with their question bank. When I showed up in the next class, there was no review of homework problems. MLIC, on the other hand, gave all of us after-class home assignments and reviewed all of it during the following day. The instructor was a professional and was patient in helping us understand difficult concepts such as sequences and functions, which were never discussed at any length in Veritas program and which actually showed up on my test. I have no reservation in recommending MLIC gmat course.          --  KPJ, Los Angeles, CA    ""I orderd your  MLIC study guides for GMAT , and was quite pleasantly surprised by the quality and the extent of coverage of GMAT concepts. The bonus practice exercises that were supplied contained questions that were very similar to the actual GMAT problems that I faced when I took the test. My score improved from 630 to 740 after working through your study guides. Thanks, MLIC!""           --  Raman Unnikrishnan , Singapore.   ""I took the Manhattan GMAT course before enrolling in your Turboprep course. When I worked through Manhattan GMAT program and the OG they provided, I was slightly offended and felt that I was paying nearly $1,500 for the $20 OG11 for GMAT that I could have bought at Barnes and Noble or Amazon. The OG11 has problems that were old and all problems were explained; I did not have to go through Manhattan GMAT to have them walk me through the same explanations. But I did and guess I was not thinking straight. MLIC trained me with newer types of questions and actually had me show them that I have all the concepts and procedures buttoned up. The difference is this: My score after MGMAT was 540; after MLIC, it was 690. MLIC is exceptional value for GMAT prep.          --  Rick Granja , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, New York, August 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 09/08 .""   ""I took the GMAT 3 times and consistently scored between 47 and 50 in the math section. My downfall was verbal section. Frustrated, I enrolled in MLIC Turboprep course in Chicago, and learned that there is a technique to reading passages and dealing with the critical reasoning section. Your training on what aspects of passages I should focus on helped me improve my verbal scaled score from 29 to 41. My total score improved from 640 to 740. Your training made the difference. Thanks, MLIC.           --  Annika Thomas  , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, Chicago, Sept. 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 10/08 .""   ""I ordered your study guides before I enrolled in your GMAT prep course in Chicago. I must say that your guides far exceeded my expectations. Your sentence correction module 3 was the best I have seen, covering all bases including parallelism, logical comparisons, positioning of qualifers and modifers, etc. The anchor phrase strategy for Rc and the section about how to determine the best answer even without reading the passage were truly helpful. Your in-class training was just as I expected -- professional and very relevant. Some of the questions in your Workbooks used in the program actually showed up on the test. I owe my 700 on the GMAT to your outstanding training.           --  Elizabeth Sweeney , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, Chicago May 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 07/08 .""

""Thank you very much for a great prep course for the GMAT. Before I took your course, I had worked through several books available in book stores to no avail. When I signed up to do your turboprep class, I found what I needed but did not realize: a guided tour of the various assessment areas. The in-class instructor was brilliant, and showed us how the different areas of the GMAT are about the same logical reasoning skills. The drilling in procedural aspects of the Gmat, especially in data sufficiency, and the hit list approach to eliminating answer choices gave me the effective tools I needed to do well on this test. I am happy to report a score of 740 on the Gmat exam which I took 10 days after your class. The score is sufficient to make me competitive at INSEAD. Your prep course works. Cheers.""           --  Matthew Hanwell , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, LONDON, November 2007--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 12/07 ."" ""I took your GMAT Turboprep course in London recently, and thought that you might want to know that I got a score of 720 on the GMAT. Your Gmat prep materials were detailed and explained all high level concepts well, and your in-class training was intense and extremely beneficial. Your Gmat training methods work. Thanks for your support.          --  Jesus De La Ortiz , GMAT PREP Course, London, August 2007--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 09/07 .""    ""I had taken the Veritas Prep course in Chicago and was totally annoyed with the poor quality of instructors. I then registered in the MLIC course and can vouch for the professionalism of the training programs. The structured way to GMAT preparation helped me better prepared and the teaching materials were top notch too. My major weakness was in the Verbal sections and MLIC's strategies for eliminating answer choices by classifying them into hit list categories helped me with a scaled score of 42 in the verbal section. I scored 740 on the GMAT after MLIC prep. Thanks, MLIC.          --  Sou K. Marty,  , GMAT PREP Course, Chicago, January 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 02/2008 .""    ""I took the MLIC prep class in Munich during April 2008 and my friend registered to take the Veritas prep weekend course. Sadly, Veritas prep canceled their classes because they had just one person registered. MLIC course went ahead with 7 participants. The course was intensive and put us through the paces in terms of techniques and concepts. I found the verbal drills particularly useful to me. I scored a 690 when I took the test on the 25th, barely three days after the class. Thanks, MLIC!          -- Stefanja Matonis  , GMAT PREP Course, Munich, April 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 05/2008 .""   ""Following your GMAT Turboprep course in Manhattan, I took the GMAT on June 27th, and scored a 680 (a huge 230 point improvement from the 450 I was making in the practice tests after I took the Veritas Elite prep course), landing myself in the 89th percentile. I also scored a  5.5 on the AWA section for 87th percentile ranking. Your GMAT prep course was a major factor in my success, and I must thank you for the thorough preparation you offered. I believe that I now have a competitive shot at admission to Columbia Business school.     As you are aware, I took the Veritas Elite GMAT course in Washington D.C. in Oct/Nov. 2005, and I felt that the Veritas Elite  Prep course lacked the necessary tools and methodology that could help me successfully prepare for the GMAT test.  When I first received your pre-class GMAT training files, I realized that your GMAT course was undoubtedly better than that offered by Veritas Elite! Although the majority of the information i had studied did not show up on the test, i felt prepared to deal with any problem that could have been thrown at me.  Veritas only prepared me for the most common problems which could be asked.  I also want to let you know that the incredible detail you pack into each GMAT study and training file allowed me to prepare for each GMAT section in the required depth.  Veritas Prep just put out some stuff out there and forced you to memorize concepts, hoping its crash course would provide enough of the tools necessary to solve most of the problems.   Veritas prep materials also lacked the depth and quality of training that MLIC offered. I strongly recommend MLIC GMAT prep course to anyone serious about getting a score in the 90th percentile range. Thanks again.

Our Turboprep GMAT course participant writes: ""A lawyer admitted to the bar in Munich Germany, I attempted to take the GMAT, knowing that my challenge was in the GMAT Math area. I took a GMAT prep course conducted by a German testpreparation company in Frankfurt and found that the level of teaching involved very simple GMAT problems, even worse than those taught in Kaplan GMAT prep or Princeton Review GMAT classes. After scoring 570 on the GMAT in my first attempt, I researched on the Internet GMAT prep courses and enrolled in the GMAT prep class offered by an American testpreparation Company, MLIC, New York. MLIC GMAT preparation course, besides offering excellent GMAT study and GMAT training materials, also reinforces the learning process with original GMAT questions. The individual attention received from dedicated instructor in the MLIC GMAT class helps one overcome his or her weakness in Mathematics and in Verbal areas of GMAT. Result: I scored 670 on the GMAT. Anyone whose GMAT Mathematics and Verbal skills are rusty should take the GMAT prep course such as the one offered by MLICETS.""--  Handelsblatt, DE, Germany's leading Business Daily  (Freitag/Samstag/Sonntag, 18/19/20.2.2005).""          WHAT IS GMAT® CAT?                  GMAT® , acronym for  G raduate  M anagement  A dmission  T est, is administered by Pearson Vue® on behalf of GMAC® and is required by all  G raduate  S chools of  B usiness for admission purposes.               The GMAT, according to  GMAC                (Graduate Management Admission Council that owns the trademarks GMAT®  and GMAT CAT®, is one measure of your ability to successfully              complete the first year of graduate study program (MBA degree program) at a Graduate School of Business.However, effective January 2006, the paper and pencil version of the GMAT test is no longer offered anywhere in the world. GMATis              administered in a CAT(Computer Adaptive) format in which the GMAT test'adapts' the              difficulty level of GMAT questions to your GMAT-specific 'comfort level', with 'higher              difficulty level GMAT questions' carrying higher GMAT raw scores (GMAT Scaled              Scores) than do 'lower difficulty level' GMAT questions. The              GMAT tests your Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning skills, and your ability (i) to process information in context, (ii) to make necessarily true and probable interpretations of information presented, and (iii) to test different scenarios for consistency of decisions. The test also is about your ability to determine whether GMAT sentences are logically, clearly, correctly, and effectively written.  The GMAT  has three              assessment areas:    AWA  (Analytical Writing Assessment)              that requires you to write Two essays, one analyzing an Issue              and the other analyzing an Argument. This first essay section on the GMAT is not 'adaptive'              and receives a separate score of between 0 and 6.   GMAT Quantitative Assessment  is the first              of the two 'adaptive' sections on the GMAT and follows the Analytical Writing section, and requires that you              answer 37 questions in problem solving and in Data Sufficiency in 75 minutes. Following the GMAT Quantitative section, you will be required to work on the last 'adaptive' section on              the GMAT is  Verbal              Assessment , which requires that you answer 41              questions in 75 minutes. The GMAT Verbal assessment includes three sections: GMAT Critical Reasoning, GMAT Sentence Correction, and GMAT Reading Comprehension. GMAT adaptive sections also include              experimental questions, at least 9 in GMAT Quantitative assessment and 11              in GMAT Verbal assessment. The two adaptive sections on the GMAT receive a combined             score of between 200 and 800. Most A-List Business Schools rated in the top-10 will              require a GMAT test score of at least 650 in order for you to be              competitive. Your best chance for success lies in your ability to              take the GMAT exam at the high difficulty level throughout. The MLICETS GMAT prep              courses offer the best GMAT test training, using the  most recent and high difficulty level questions that are live on the GMAT  so that              you can competently and confidently take the GMAT test in a timed-environment.

TESTIMONIALS ABOUT MLIC GMAT COURSES  ""I had taken Kaplan course for the GMATs and enrolled in MLIC's preparatory course in London after scoring a miserable 480. Here is my experience with both programmes:  Kaplan course was run by an instructor who taught a few tricks and showed how they worked with a couple of problems from the book and moved on. MLIC course had a professional instructor who was highly knowledgeable and who put us through the paces in respect of procedures and concepts, and was able to help each one of us in our weak areas. MLIC training materials for the GMAT were more thorough and covered some of the areas actually tested on the GMAT: sequences, patterns, permutations and combinations, and parabolas that actually showed up on my test.  There are massive differences between the Kaplan course and that offered by MLIC, and my experience is that MLIC is vastly superior. My score improved from 480 to 670 after the MLIC class. I have no hesitation in recommending MLIC course for the GMAT.            --  David Hanfil , GMAT TURBOPREP® Course, London Paddington, April 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 05/08 .""   ""I was a trainee in your Gmat turboprep course in London during January 2008, and received a score of 710 when I took the exam 10 days after the course. Having worked through other prep materials available from book stores, I was impressed with your study guides and training materials that covered the Gmat sections in great depth. Your training methods and strategies for verbal sections were brilliant. Last but not least, your Gmat trainer was witty and competent, and explained how different areas of the Gmat test the same skills.  Your prep methods work.

PRE-CLASS GMAT TRAINING   OBJECTIVE OF PRE-COURSE TRAINING  The objective of pre-course training lasting about 50 to 60 hours is to provide a highly structured approach to GMAT training, and to have the registered participants begin to review GMAT-critical concepts and procedures that are critical to taking the GMAT confidently and competently. The pre-course training is also structured to provide remedial training in areas such as algebra, statistics, and sentence correction grammar and idiom rules, and to create a diagnostic baseline for the in-class training. The pre-course training is also meant to help participants unlearn some of the bad habits that they may have picked up from reading useless GMAT prep materials that can be bought in book stores (materials such as those published by Barrons, Arco, GMAT for dummies, to name a few) or obtained from other me-too prep companies (such as Kaplan, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Veritas Prep, Testmasters, 800score.com and others) that have no proven competencies in GMAT training. The pre-course GMAT training is expected to require a commitment of about 50 to 60 hours before you attend the in-class training sessions and provides the required depth of understanding in all the GMAT concepts areas so that you can leverage the in-class training.

Review of Analytical Writing basics and completion of 5 writing tasks covering GMAT Analysis of an Issue and GMAT Analysis of an Argument.   Review of Sentence Correction Grammar and Idiom rules tested on the GMAT, and completion of a short assignment testing your understanding of the critical rules in Sentence Correction.   Review of Subject-Scope-Qualifier strategy for GMAT Critical Reasoning, and review of Illogical and Logical Arguments; Review of types of questions tested in critical reasoning and the procedures for answering them; Review of Hit List of phrases that will spell trouble in Critical Reasoning answer choices.   Review of Anchor-Phrase Strategy for GMAT Reading Comprehension, and procedures for making Logical interpretation of context-specific information relevant to the question.

The  SAT Reasoning Test  (formerly  Scholastic Aptitude Test  and  Scholastic Assessment Test ) is a  standardized test  for  college admissions  in the  United States . The SAT is owned, published, and developed by the  College Board , a  non-profit organization  in the United States, and was once developed, published, and scored by the  Educational Testing Service  (ETS). [ 1 ]  ETS now administers the exam.   The current SAT Reasoning Test is administered in about four and one half hours and costs $50 ($71 International), excluding late fees. [ 2 ]  Since the SAT's introduction in 1901, its name and scoring has changed several times. In 2005, the test was renamed as ""SAT Reasoning Test"" with possible scores from 600 to 2400 combining test results from three 800-point sections (math, critical reading, and writing), along with other subsections scored separately.

They state that the SAT assesses how well the test takers analyze and solve problemsskills they learned in school that they will need in college. The SAT is typically taken by  high school   juniors  and  seniors . [ 3 ]  Specifically, the College Board states that use of the SAT in combination with high school grade point average (GPA) provides a better indicator of success in college than high school grades alone, as measured by college freshman  GPA . Various studies conducted over the lifetime of the SAT show a statistically significant increase in  correlation  of high school grades and freshman grades when the SAT is factored in. [ 4 ]   There are substantial differences in funding, curricula, grading, and difficulty among U.S. secondary schools due to American  federalism , local control, and the prevalence of private, distance, and  home schooled  students. SAT (and  ACT ) scores are intended to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local datasuch as course work, grades, and class rankin a national perspective. [ 5 ]   Historically, the SAT has been more popular among colleges in the coasts and the ACT more popular in the Midwest and South. There are some colleges that require the ACT to be taken for college course placement, and a few schools that do not accept the SAT at all.  [ 6 ]   Certain high IQ societies, like  Mensa  and the  Triple Nine Society , use scores from certain years as one of their admission tests. For instance, the  Triple Nine Society  accepts scores of 1450 on tests taken before April 1995, and scores of at least 1520 on tests taken between April 1995 and February 2005.     [ edit ]   Structure   SAT consists of three major sections: Critical  Reading ,  Mathematics , and  Writing . Each section receives a score on the scale of 200800. All scores are multiples of 10. Total scores are calculated by adding up scores of the three sections. Each major section is divided into three parts. There are 10 sub-sections, including an additional 25-minute experimental or ""equating"" section that may be in any of the three major sections. The experimental section is used to  normalize  questions for future administrations of the SAT and does not count toward the final score. The test contains 3 hours and 45 minutes of actual timed sections, [ 7 ]  although most administrations, including orientation, distribution of materials, completion of biographical sections, and eleven minutes of timed breaks, run about four and a half hours long.     [ edit ]   Critical Reading   The Critical Reading, formerly verbal, section of the SAT is made up of three scored sections, two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, with varying types of questions, including sentence completions and questions about short and long reading passages. Critical Reading sections normally begin with 5 to 8 sentence completion questions; the remainder of the questions are focused on the reading passages. Sentence completions generally test the student's  vocabulary  and understanding of sentence structure and organization by requiring the student to select one or two words that best complete a given sentence. The bulk of the Critical Reading questions is made up of questions regarding reading passages, in which students read short excerpts on social sciences, humanities, physical sciences, or personal narratives and answer questions based on the passage. Certain sections contain passages asking the student to compare two related passages; generally, these consist of short reading passages as well as longer passages. Since this is a timed test, the number of questions about each passage is proportional to the length of the passage.     [ edit ]   Mathematics   The  Mathematics  section of SAT is widely known as Quantitative Section. Mathematics section consists of three scored sections. There are two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, as follows:     One of the 25-minute sections is entirely multiple choice, with 20 questions.   The other 25-minute section contains 8 multiple choice questions and 10 grid-in questions.   The 20-minute is all multiple choice, with only 16 questions.     Notably, the SAT has done away with quantitative comparison questions on the math section, leaving only questions with straightforward  symbolic  or  numerical  answers. Since the quantitative comparison questions were well-known for their deceptive natureoften turning on the student's recognition of a single exception to a rule or patternthis choice has been equated to a philosophical shift away from ""trickery"" and toward ""straight math"" on the SAT. Also, many test experts have attributed this change, like the addition of the new writing section, to an attempt to make the SAT more like the  ACT . Indeed, there is a correlation between ACT scores and SAT scores. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Writing          Page 1 of an SAT essay. This student received a 7/12 from two judges, one giving 3/6 and the other giving 4/6.              Page 2 of the same essay.       The writing section of the SAT, based on but not directly comparable to the old SAT II subject test in writing, includes multiple choice questions and a brief essay. The essay subscore contributes about 30% towards the total writing score, with the multiple choice questions contributing 70%. This section was implemented in March 2005 following complaints from colleges about the lack of uniform examples of a student's writing ability.   The multiple choice questions include error identification questions, sentence improvement questions, and paragraph improvement questions. Error identification and sentence improvement questions test the student's knowledge of grammar, presenting an awkward or grammatically incorrect sentence; in the error identification section, the student must locate the word producing the source of the error or indicate that the sentence has no error, while the sentence improvement section requires the student to select an acceptable fix to the awkward sentence. The paragraph improvement questions test the student's understanding of logical organization of ideas, presenting a poorly written student essay and asking a series of questions as to what changes might be made to best improve it.   The essay section, which is always administered as the first section of the test, is 25 minutes long. All essays must be in response to a given prompt. The prompts are broad and often philosophical and are designed to be accessible to students regardless of their educational and social backgrounds. For instance, test takers may be asked to expound on such ideas as their opinion on the value of work in human life or whether technological change also carries negative consequences to those who benefit from it. No particular essay structure is required, and the College Board accepts examples ""taken from [the student's] reading, studies, experience, or observations."" Two trained readers assign each essay a score between 1 and 6, where a score of 0 is reserved for essays that are blank, off-topic, non-English, not written with a Number 2 pencil, or considered illegible after several attempts at reading. The scores are summed to produce a final score from 2 to 12 (or 0). If the two readers' scores differ by more than one point, then a senior third reader decides. The average time each reader/grader spends on each essay is less than 3 minutes.  [ 10 ]   Despite the  College Board 's claims that the SAT Essay is a nonbiased assessment of a student's writing ability, many different claims of bias have surfaced, including claims that readers give higher points to those who write in cursive, writers who write about personal experiences are less likely to get higher scores, and that topics favor the higher social classes. [ citation needed ]  The College Board strictly denies any forms of bias on all portions of the SAT Reasoning Exam. In addition, essays with factual errors were not penalized for the errors.   In March 2004 Dr. Les Perelman analyzed 15 scored sample essays contained in the College Board's Score Write book and found that 90% of essays that contained more than 400 words got the highest score of 12 and that the essays with 100 words or fewer got the lowest grade of 1. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Questions   Most of the questions on the SAT are  multiple choice ; all multiple-choice questions have five answer choices, one of which is correct. The questions of each section of the same type are generally ordered by difficulty. However, an important exception exists: Questions that follow the long and short reading passages are organized chronologically, rather than by difficulty. Ten of the questions in one of the math sub-sections are not multiple choice. They instead require the test taker to bubble in a number in a four-column grid.   The questions are weighted equally. For each correct answer, one raw point is added. For each incorrect answer one-fourth of a point is deducted. [ 11 ]  No points are deducted for incorrect math grid-in questions. This ensures that a student's  mathematically expected gain  from guessing is zero. The final score is derived from the raw score; the precise conversion chart varies between test administrations.   The SAT therefore recommends only making educated guesses, that is, when the test taker can eliminate at least one answer he or she thinks is wrong. Without eliminating any answers one's probability of answering correctly is 20%. Eliminating one wrong answer increases this probability to 25%; two, a 33.3% probability; three, a 50% probability of choosing the correct answer and thus earning the full point for the question.

The test is typically offered on the first Saturday of the month for the November, December, May, and June administrations. In other countries, the SAT is offered on the same dates as in the  United States  except for the first spring test date (i.e., March or April), which is not offered. In 2006, the test was taken 1,465,744 times. [ 12 ]   Candidates may either take the SAT Reasoning Test or up to three  SAT Subject Tests  on any given test date, except the first spring test date, when only the SAT Reasoning Test is offered. Candidates wishing to take the test may register online at the College Board's website, by mail, or by telephone, at least three weeks before the test date.   The SAT Subject Tests are all given in one large book on test day. Therefore, it is actually immaterial which tests, and how many, the student signs up for; with the possible exception of the language tests with listening, the student may change his or her mind and take  any  tests, regardless of his or her initial sign-ups. Students who choose to take more subject tests than they signed up for will later be billed by College Board for the additional tests and their scores will be withheld until the bill is paid. Students who choose to take fewer subject tests than they signed up for are not eligible for a refund.   The SAT Reasoning Test costs $45 ($71 International). For the Subject tests, students pay a $20 Basic Registration Fee and $9 per test (except for language tests with listening, which cost $20 each). [ 2 ]  The College Board makes fee waivers available for low income students. Additional fees apply for late registration, standby testing, registration changes, scores by telephone, and extra score reports (beyond the four provided for free).   Candidates whose religious beliefs prevent them from taking the test on a Saturday may request to take the test on the following Sunday, except for the October test date in which the Sunday test date is eight days after the main test offering. Such requests must be made at the time of registration and are subject to denial.   Students with verifiable disabilities, including physical and learning disabilities, are eligible to take the SAT with accommodations. The standard time increase for students requiring additional time due to learning disabilities is 50%.     [ edit ]   Raw scores, scaled scores, and percentiles   Students receive their online score reports approximately three weeks after test administration (six weeks for mailed, paper scores), with each section graded on a scale of 200800 and two sub scores for the writing section: the essay score and the multiple choice sub score. In addition to their score, students receive their  percentile  (the percentage of other test takers with lower scores). The raw score, or the number of points gained from correct answers and lost from incorrect answers (ranges from just under 50 to just under 60, depending upon the test), is also included. [ 13 ]  Students may also receive, for an additional fee, the Question and Answer Service, which provides the student's answer, the correct answer to each question, and online resources explaining each question.   The corresponding percentile of each scaled score varies from test to testfor example, in 2003, a scaled score of 800 in both sections of the SAT Reasoning Test corresponded to a percentile of 99.9, while a scaled score of 800 in the SAT Physics Test corresponded to the 94th percentile. The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are because of the content of the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to intensive study (often in the form of an  AP , which is relatively more difficult), and only those who know they will perform well tend to take these tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores.   The percentiles that various SAT scores for college-bound seniors correspond to are summarized in the following chart: [ 14 ] [ 12 ]       Percentile   Score, 1600 Scale  (official, 2006)   Score, 2400 Scale  (official, 2006)       99.93/99.98*   1600   2400       99+   1550   2300       99   1480   2200       98   1450   2140       97   1420   2100       88   1380   1900       83   1280   1800       78   1200   1770       72   1150   1700       61   1090   1600       48   1010   1500       36   950   1400       15   810   1200       4   670   1010       1   520   790       * The percentile of the perfect score was 99.98 on the 2400 scale and 99.93 on the 1600 scale.       The older SAT (before 1995) had a very high ceiling. In any given year, only seven of the million test-takers scored above 1580. A score above 1580 was equivalent to the 99.9995 percentile.

Although there is no official conversion chart between the SAT and its biggest rival, the  ACT , the College Board released an unofficial chart based on results from 103,525 test takers who took both tests between October 1994 and December 1996  here ; however, both tests have changed since then. Several colleges have also issued their own charts. The following is based on the University of California's conversion chart.

[ edit ]   1901 test   The College Board began on June 17, 1901, when 973 students took its first test, across 67 locations in the United States, and two in Europe. Although those taking the test came from a variety of backgrounds, approximately one third were from  New York ,  New Jersey , or  Pennsylvania . The majority of those taking the test were from private schools, academies, or endowed schools. About 60% of those taking the test applied to  Columbia University . The test contained sections on English,  French ,  German ,  Latin ,  Greek , history, mathematics,  chemistry , and  physics . The test was not multiple choice, but instead was evaluated based on essay responses as ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""doubtful,"" ""poor,"" or ""very poor.""  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   1926 test   The first administration of the SAT occurred on June 23, 1926, when it was known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of  definitions ,  arithmetic , classification, artificial language,  antonyms , number series,  analogies ,  logical inference , and paragraph reading. It was administered to over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to  Yale University  and  Smith College  respectively.  [ 20 ]  The test was paced rather quickly, test-takers being given only a little over 90 minutes to answer 315 questions. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1928 and 1929 tests   In 1928 the number of verbal sections was reduced to 7, and the time limit was increased to slightly under two hours. In 1929 the number of sections was again reduced, this time to 6. These changes in part loosened time constraints on test-takers. Math was eliminated entirely for these tests, instead focusing only on verbal ability. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1930 test and 1936 changes   In 1930 the SAT was first split into the verbal and math sections, a structure that would continue through 2004. The verbal section of the 1930 test covered a more narrow range on content than its predecessors, examining only antonyms, double definitions (somewhat similar to sentence completions), and paragraph reading. In 1936, analogies were re-added. Between 1936 and 1946, students had between 80 and 115 minutes to answer 250 verbal questions (over a third of which were on antonyms). The mathematics test introduced in 1930 contained 100 free response questions to be answered in 80 minutes, and focused primarily on speed. From 1936 to 1941, like the 1928 and 1929 tests, the mathematics section was eliminated entirely. When the mathematics portion of the test was re-added in 1942, it consisted of multiple choice questions. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1946 test and associated changes   Paragraph reading was eliminated from the verbal portion of the SAT in 1946, and replaced with reading comprehension, and ""double definition"" questions were replaced with sentence completions. Between 1946 and 1957 students were given 90 to 100 minutes to complete 107 to 170 verbal questions. Starting in 1958 time limits became more stable, and for 17 years, until 1975, students had 75 minutes to answer 90 questions. In 1959 questions on data sufficiency were introduced to the mathematics section, and then replaced with quantitative comparisons in 1974. In 1974 both verbal and math sections were reduced from 75 minutes to 60 minutes each, with changes in test composition compensating for the decreased time. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1980 test and associated changes   The inclusion of the ""Strivers"" Score study was implemented. This study was introduced by The Educational Testing Service, which administers the SAT, and has been conducting research on how to make it easier for minorities and individuals who suffer from social and economic barriers. The original ""Strivers"" project, which was in the research phase from 19801994, awarded special ""Striver"" status to test-takers who scored 200 points higher than expected for their race, gender and income level. The belief was that this would give minorities a better chance at being accepted in to a college of higher standard, i.e. an Ivy League school. In 1992, the Strivers Project was leaked to the public; as a result the Strivers Project was terminated in 1993. After Federal Courts heard arguments from the ACLU, NAACP and the Educational Testing Service, the courts ordered the study to alter its data collection process, stating that only the age, race and zip code could be used to determine the test-takers eligibility for ""Strivers"" points. These changes were introduced to the SAT effective in 1994.     [ edit ]   1994 changes   In 1994 the verbal section received a dramatic change in focus. Among these changes were the removal of  antonym  questions, and an increased focus on passage reading. The mathematics section also saw a dramatic change in 1994, thanks in part to pressure from the  National Council of Teachers of Mathematics . For the first time since 1935, the SAT asked some non-multiple choice questions, instead requiring students to supply the answers. 1994 also saw the introduction of calculators into the mathematics section for the first time in the test's history. The mathematics section introduced concepts of probability, slope, elementary statistics, counting problems, median and mode. [ 19 ]   The average score on the 1994 modification of the SAT I was usually around 1000 (500 on the verbal, 500 on the math). The most selective schools in the United States (for example, those in the  Ivy League ) typically had SAT averages exceeding 1400 on the old test.     [ edit ]   2002 changes - Score Choice   In October 2002, the College Board dropped the Score Choice Option. Under this option, scores were not released to colleges until the student saw and approved of the score. [ 21 ]  The reasoning was that the option benefited wealthier students who could afford to take it multiple times. The College Board has since decided to re-implement Score Choice in the spring of 2009. It is described as optional, and it is not clear if the reports sent will indicate whether or not this student has opted-in or not. A number of highly selective colleges and universities have accounced they will require applicants to submit all scores, including Harvard, Cornell, Yale and Stanford. Others, such as MIT, have embraced Score Choice.     [ edit ]   2005 changes   In 2005, the test was changed again, largely in response to criticism by the  University of California system . [ 22 ]  Because of issues concerning ambiguous questions, especially  analogies , certain types of questions were eliminated (the analogies from the verbal and quantitative comparisons from the Math section). The test was made marginally harder, as a corrective to the rising number of perfect scores. A new writing section, with an essay, based on the former SAT II Writing Subject Test, was added, in part to increase the chances of closing the opening gap between the highest and midrange scores. Other factors included the desire to test the writing ability of each student in a personal manner; hence the essay. The New SAT (known as the SAT Reasoning Test) was first offered on March 12, 2005, after the last administration of the ""old"" SAT in January of 2005. The Mathematics section was expanded to cover three years of high school mathematics. The Verbal section's name was changed to the Critical Reading section.     [ edit ]   2008 changes   In 2008, or rather for the late 2008, 2009 testing, a new variable came into play. Before, it was required for applicants to most colleges to submit all scores with some colleges who embraced Score Choice to allow their students to do so. However, this year, applicants now have the choice to submit their best score (in theory one could send any score they wish to send) to the college of their choice, no matter the college. Designed to reduce stress to applicants as well as make the overall process easier, students in many schools have embraced this change with a sigh of relief.     [ edit ]   Name changes and recentered scores   Although originally standing for ""Scholastic Aptitude Test"" [ 23 ] , in 1990, because of uncertainty about the SAT's ability to function as an  intelligence test , the name was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test. In 1993 the name was changed to SAT I: Reasoning Test (with the  letters not standing for anything ) to distinguish it from the  SAT II: Subject Tests [ 23 ] . In 2004, the roman numerals on both tests were dropped, and the SAT I renamed the SAT Reasoning Test [ 23 ] . The scoring categories are now the following: Critical Reading (comparable to some of the Verbal portions of the old SAT I), Mathematics, and Writing. The writing section now includes an essay, whose score is involved in computing the overall score for the Writing section, as well as grammar sections (also comparable to some Verbal portions of the previous SAT).   The test scoring was initially scaled to make 500 the mean score on each section with a  standard deviation  of 100. [ 24 ]  As the test grew more popular and more students from less rigorous schools began taking the test, the average dropped to about 428 Verbal and 478 Math. The SAT was ""recentered"" in 1995, and the average ""new"" score became again close to 500. Scores awarded after 1994 and before October 2001 are officially reported with an ""R"" (e.g. 1260R) to reflect this change. Old scores may be recentered to compare to 1995 to present scores by using official College Board tables [ 25 ]  , which in the middle ranges add about 70 points to Verbal and 20 or 30 points to Math. In other words, current students have a 100 (70 plus 30) point advantage over their parents.     [ edit ]   Controversy     [ edit ]   Scoring problems of October 2005 tests   In March 2006, it was announced that a small percentage of the SATs taken in October 2005 had been scored incorrectly due to the test papers being moist and not scanning properly, and that some students had received substantially erroneous scores. The College Board announced they would change the scores for the students who were given a lower score than they earned, but at this point many of those students had already applied to colleges using their original scores. The College Board decided not to change the scores for the students who were given a higher score than they earned. A lawsuit was filed in 2005 by about 4,400 students who received an incorrect low score on the SAT. The class-action suit was settled in August 2007 when The College Board and another company that administers the college-admissions test announced they would pay $2.85 million to over 4,000 students. Under the agreement each student can either elect to receive $275 or submit a claim for more money if he or she feels the damage was even greater. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Criticism     [ edit ]   Bias                        As depicted above, SAT scores vary according to race, income, and parental educational background.       A famous example of alleged bias in the SAT I was the  oarsman - regatta  analogy question. [ 27 ]  The object of the question was to find the pair of terms that have the relationship most similar to the relationship between ""runner"" and ""marathon."" The correct answer was ""oarsman"" and ""regatta."" Choice of the correct answer presupposed students' familiarity with a sport popular with the wealthy, and so upon their knowledge of its structure and terminology. Fifty-three percent (53%) of white students - who in greater numbers come from higher income households - correctly answered the question, while only 22% of black students - who disproportionately came from lower income households - also scored correctly. [ 28 ]  Analogy questions have since been replaced by short reading passages.     [ edit ]   Dropping SAT   A growing number of  liberal arts colleges  have responded to this criticism by joining the  SAT optional movement . These colleges do not require the SAT for admission.   In a 2001 speech to the  American Council on Education ,  Richard C. Atkinson , then president of the  University of California , urged dropping the SAT Reasoning Test as a college admissions requirement:     ""Anyone involved in education should be concerned about how overemphasis on the SAT is distorting educational priorities and practices, how the test is perceived by many as unfair, and how it can have a devastating impact on the self-esteem and aspirations of young students. There is widespread agreement that overemphasis on the SAT harms American education."" [ 29 ]     In response to threats by the University of California to drop the SAT as an admission requirement, the College Entrance Examination Board announced the restructuring of the SAT, to take effect in March 2005, as detailed above.     [ edit ]   Essay   In 2005,  MIT  Writing Director  Les Perelman  plotted essay length versus essay score on the new SAT from released essays and found a high correlation between them. After studying 23 graded essays he found that the longer the essay was the higher the score. He also discovered that several of these essays were full of factual errors. However, the official SAT guide for scorers state that the essays should be scored according to their quality of writing and not factual accuracy. The National Council of Teachers of English also criticize the 25-minute writing section of the test, arguing that the basic principles of writing encourage the revision of written material several times. They say that the amount of time allowed for the test pushes schools to develop a formulaic system of writing. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Test preparation   Many companies and organizations offer test preparation in the form of books, classes, online courses, tutoring and only recently, board games. Large organizations include  Kaplan ,  the Princeton Review , PowerScore, Barron's, Elite Educational Institute, Revolution Prep, Ivy Insiders, Testmasters, SAT Solutions, and College Board (the test makers), as well as some boutique organizations such as Los Angeles-based College Prep Review. Some have criticized the SAT test because preparation often can lead to much higher scores, but some have embraced the opportunity to improve their scores.

(February 2009)       The  SAT Reasoning Test  (formerly  Scholastic Aptitude Test  and  Scholastic Assessment Test ) is a  standardized test  for  college admissions  in the  United States . The SAT is owned, published, and developed by the  College Board , a  non-profit organization  in the United States, and was once developed, published, and scored by the  Educational Testing Service  (ETS). [ 1 ]  ETS now administers the exam.   The current SAT Reasoning Test is administered in about four and one half hours and costs $50 ($71 International), excluding late fees. [ 2 ]  Since the SAT's introduction in 1901, its name and scoring has changed several times. In 2005, the test was renamed as ""SAT Reasoning Test"" with possible scores from 600 to 2400 combining test results from three 800-point sections (math, critical reading, and writing), along with other subsections scored separately.

They state that the SAT assesses how well the test takers analyze and solve problemsskills they learned in school that they will need in college. The SAT is typically taken by  high school   juniors  and  seniors . [ 3 ]  Specifically, the College Board states that use of the SAT in combination with high school grade point average (GPA) provides a better indicator of success in college than high school grades alone, as measured by college freshman  GPA . Various studies conducted over the lifetime of the SAT show a statistically significant increase in  correlation  of high school grades and freshman grades when the SAT is factored in. [ 4 ]   There are substantial differences in funding, curricula, grading, and difficulty among U.S. secondary schools due to American  federalism , local control, and the prevalence of private, distance, and  home schooled  students. SAT (and  ACT ) scores are intended to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local datasuch as course work, grades, and class rankin a national perspective. [ 5 ]   Historically, the SAT has been more popular among colleges in the coasts and the ACT more popular in the Midwest and South. There are some colleges that require the ACT to be taken for college course placement, and a few schools that do not accept the SAT at all.  [ 6 ]   Certain high  IQ  societies, like  Mensa  and the  Triple Nine Society , use scores from certain years as one of their admission tests. For instance, the  Triple Nine Society  accepts scores of 1450 on tests taken before April 1995, and scores of at least 1520 on tests taken between April 1995 and February 2005.     [ edit ]   Structure   SAT consists of three major sections: Critical  Reading ,  Mathematics , and  Writing . Each section receives a score on the scale of 200800. All scores are multiples of 10. Total scores are calculated by adding up scores of the three sections. Each major section is divided into three parts. There are 10 sub-sections, including an additional 25-minute experimental or ""equating"" section that may be in any of the three major sections. The experimental section is used to  normalize  questions for future administrations of the SAT and does not count toward the final score. The test contains 3 hours and 45 minutes of actual timed sections, [ 7 ]  although most administrations, including orientation, distribution of materials, completion of biographical sections, and eleven minutes of timed breaks, run about four and a half hours long.     [ edit ]   Critical Reading   The Critical Reading, formerly verbal, section of the SAT is made up of three scored sections, two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, with varying types of questions, including sentence completions and questions about short and long reading passages. Critical Reading sections normally begin with 5 to 8 sentence completion questions; the remainder of the questions are focused on the reading passages. Sentence completions generally test the student's  vocabulary  and understanding of sentence structure and organization by requiring the student to select one or two words that best complete a given sentence. The bulk of the Critical Reading questions is made up of questions regarding reading passages, in which students read short excerpts on social sciences, humanities, physical sciences, or personal narratives and answer questions based on the passage. Certain sections contain passages asking the student to compare two related passages; generally, these consist of short reading passages as well as longer passages. Since this is a timed test, the number of questions about each passage is proportional to the length of the passage.     [ edit ]   Mathematics   The  Mathematics  section of SAT is widely known as Quantitative Section. Mathematics section consists of three scored sections. There are two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, as follows:     One of the 25-minute sections is entirely multiple choice, with 20 questions.   The other 25-minute section contains 8 multiple choice questions and 10 grid-in questions.   The 20-minute is all multiple choice, with only 16 questions.     Notably, the SAT has done away with quantitative comparison questions on the math section, leaving only questions with straightforward  symbolic  or  numerical  answers. Since the quantitative comparison questions were well-known for their deceptive natureoften turning on the student's recognition of a single exception to a rule or patternthis choice has been equated to a philosophical shift away from ""trickery"" and toward ""straight math"" on the SAT. Also, many test experts have attributed this change, like the addition of the new writing section, to an attempt to make the SAT more like the  ACT . Indeed, there is a correlation between ACT scores and SAT scores. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Writing          Page 1 of an SAT essay. This student received a 7/12 from two judges, one giving 3/6 and the other giving 4/6.              Page 2 of the same essay.       The writing section of the SAT, based on but not directly comparable to the old SAT II subject test in writing, includes multiple choice questions and a brief essay. The essay subscore contributes about 30% towards the total writing score, with the multiple choice questions contributing 70%. This section was implemented in March 2005 following complaints from colleges about the lack of uniform examples of a student's writing ability.   The multiple choice questions include error identification questions, sentence improvement questions, and paragraph improvement questions. Error identification and sentence improvement questions test the student's knowledge of grammar, presenting an awkward or grammatically incorrect sentence; in the error identification section, the student must locate the word producing the source of the error or indicate that the sentence has no error, while the sentence improvement section requires the student to select an acceptable fix to the awkward sentence. The paragraph improvement questions test the student's understanding of logical organization of ideas, presenting a poorly written student essay and asking a series of questions as to what changes might be made to best improve it.   The essay section, which is always administered as the first section of the test, is 25 minutes long. All essays must be in response to a given prompt. The prompts are broad and often philosophical and are designed to be accessible to students regardless of their educational and social backgrounds. For instance, test takers may be asked to expound on such ideas as their opinion on the value of work in human life or whether technological change also carries negative consequences to those who benefit from it. No particular essay structure is required, and the College Board accepts examples ""taken from [the student's] reading, studies, experience, or observations."" Two trained readers assign each essay a score between 1 and 6, where a score of 0 is reserved for essays that are blank, off-topic, non-English, not written with a Number 2 pencil, or considered illegible after several attempts at reading. The scores are summed to produce a final score from 2 to 12 (or 0). If the two readers' scores differ by more than one point, then a senior third reader decides. The average time each reader/grader spends on each essay is less than 3 minutes.  [ 10 ]   Despite the  College Board 's claims that the SAT Essay is a nonbiased assessment of a student's writing ability, many different claims of bias have surfaced, including claims that readers give higher points to those who write in cursive, writers who write about personal experiences are less likely to get higher scores, and that topics favor the higher social classes. [ citation needed ]  The College Board strictly denies any forms of bias on all portions of the SAT Reasoning Exam. In addition, essays with factual errors were not penalized for the errors.   In March 2004 Dr. Les Perelman analyzed 15 scored sample essays contained in the College Board's Score Write book and found that 90% of essays that contained more than 400 words got the highest score of 12 and that the essays with 100 words or fewer got the lowest grade of 1. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Questions   Most of the questions on the SAT are  multiple choice ; all multiple-choice questions have five answer choices, one of which is correct. The questions of each section of the same type are generally ordered by difficulty. However, an important exception exists: Questions that follow the long and short reading passages are organized chronologically, rather than by difficulty. Ten of the questions in one of the math sub-sections are not multiple choice. They instead require the test taker to bubble in a number in a four-column grid.   The questions are weighted equally. For each correct answer, one raw point is added. For each incorrect answer one-fourth of a point is deducted. [ 11 ]  No points are deducted for incorrect math grid-in questions. This ensures that a student's  mathematically expected gain  from guessing is zero. The final score is derived from the raw score; the precise conversion chart varies between test administrations.   The SAT therefore recommends only making educated guesses, that is, when the test taker can eliminate at least one answer he or she thinks is wrong. Without eliminating any answers one's probability of answering correctly is 20%. Eliminating one wrong answer increases this probability to 25%; two, a 33.3% probability; three, a 50% probability of choosing the correct answer and thus earning the full point for the question.

The test is typically offered on the first Saturday of the month for the November, December, May, and June administrations. In other countries, the SAT is offered on the same dates as in the  United States  except for the first spring test date (i.e., March or April), which is not offered. In 2006, the test was taken 1,465,744 times. [ 12 ]   Candidates may either take the SAT Reasoning Test or up to three  SAT Subject Tests  on any given test date, except the first spring test date, when only the SAT Reasoning Test is offered. Candidates wishing to take the test may register online at the College Board's website, by mail, or by telephone, at least three weeks before the test date.   The SAT Subject Tests are all given in one large book on test day. Therefore, it is actually immaterial which tests, and how many, the student signs up for; with the possible exception of the language tests with listening, the student may change his or her mind and take  any  tests, regardless of his or her initial sign-ups. Students who choose to take more subject tests than they signed up for will later be billed by College Board for the additional tests and their scores will be withheld until the bill is paid. Students who choose to take fewer subject tests than they signed up for are not eligible for a refund.   The SAT Reasoning Test costs $45 ($71 International). For the Subject tests, students pay a $20 Basic Registration Fee and $9 per test (except for language tests with listening, which cost $20 each). [ 2 ]  The College Board makes fee waivers available for low income students. Additional fees apply for late registration, standby testing, registration changes, scores by telephone, and extra score reports (beyond the four provided for free).   Candidates whose religious beliefs prevent them from taking the test on a Saturday may request to take the test on the following Sunday, except for the October test date in which the Sunday test date is eight days after the main test offering. Such requests must be made at the time of registration and are subject to denial.   Students with verifiable disabilities, including physical and learning disabilities, are eligible to take the SAT with accommodations. The standard time increase for students requiring additional time due to learning disabilities is 50%.     [ edit ]   Raw scores, scaled scores, and percentiles   Students receive their online score reports approximately three weeks after test administration (six weeks for mailed, paper scores), with each section graded on a scale of 200800 and two sub scores for the writing section: the essay score and the multiple choice sub score. In addition to their score, students receive their  percentile  (the percentage of other test takers with lower scores). The raw score, or the number of points gained from correct answers and lost from incorrect answers (ranges from just under 50 to just under 60, depending upon the test), is also included. [ 13 ]  Students may also receive, for an additional fee, the Question and Answer Service, which provides the student's answer, the correct answer to each question, and online resources explaining each question.   The corresponding percentile of each scaled score varies from test to testfor example, in 2003, a scaled score of 800 in both sections of the SAT Reasoning Test corresponded to a percentile of 99.9, while a scaled score of 800 in the SAT Physics Test corresponded to the 94th percentile. The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are because of the content of the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to intensive study (often in the form of an  AP , which is relatively more difficult), and only those who know they will perform well tend to take these tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores.   The percentiles that various SAT scores for college-bound seniors correspond to are summarized in the following chart: [ 14 ] [ 12 ]       Percentile   Score, 1600 Scale  (official, 2006)   Score, 2400 Scale  (official, 2006)       99.93/99.98*   1600   2400       99+   1540   2290       99   1480   2200       98   1450   2140       97   1420   2100       88   1380   1900       83   1280   1800       78   1200   1770       72   1150   1700       61   1090   1600       48   1010   1500       36   950   1400       15   810   1200       4   670   1010       1   520   790       * The percentile of the perfect score was 99.98 on the 2400 scale and 99.93 on the 1600 scale.       The older SAT (before 1995) had a very high ceiling. In any given year, only seven of the million test-takers scored above 1580. A score above 1580 was equivalent to the 99.9995 percentile. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   SAT-ACT score comparisons          Map of states according to preferred exam of 2006 high school graduates. States in orange had more students taking the SAT than the  ACT .       Although there is no official conversion chart between the SAT and its biggest rival, the  ACT , the College Board released an unofficial chart based on results from 103,525 test takers who took both tests between October 1994 and December 1996  here ; however, both tests have changed since then.

[ edit ]   1901 test   The College Board began on June 17, 1901, when 973 students took its first test, across 67 locations in the United States, and two in Europe. Although those taking the test came from a variety of backgrounds, approximately one third were from  New York ,  New Jersey , or  Pennsylvania . The majority of those taking the test were from private schools, academies, or endowed schools. About 60% of those taking the test applied to  Columbia University . The test contained sections on English,  French ,  German ,  Latin ,  Greek , history, mathematics,  chemistry , and  physics . The test was not multiple choice, but instead was evaluated based on essay responses as ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""doubtful,"" ""poor,"" or ""very poor.""  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   1926 test   The first administration of the SAT occurred on June 23, 1926, when it was known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of  definitions ,  arithmetic , classification, artificial language,  antonyms , number series,  analogies ,  logical inference , and paragraph reading. It was administered to over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to  Yale University  and  Smith College  respectively.  [ 20 ]  The test was paced rather quickly, test-takers being given only a little over 90 minutes to answer 315 questions. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1928 and 1929 tests   In 1928 the number of verbal sections was reduced to 7, and the time limit was increased to slightly under two hours. In 1929 the number of sections was again reduced, this time to 6. These changes in part loosened time constraints on test-takers. Math was eliminated entirely for these tests, instead focusing only on verbal ability. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1930 test and 1936 changes   In 1930 the SAT was first split into the verbal and math sections, a structure that would continue through 2004. The verbal section of the 1930 test covered a more narrow range on content than its predecessors, examining only antonyms, double definitions (somewhat similar to sentence completions), and paragraph reading. In 1936, analogies were re-added. Between 1936 and 1946, students had between 80 and 115 minutes to answer 250 verbal questions (over a third of which were on antonyms). The mathematics test introduced in 1930 contained 100 free response questions to be answered in 80 minutes, and focused primarily on speed. From 1936 to 1941, like the 1928 and 1929 tests, the mathematics section was eliminated entirely. When the mathematics portion of the test was re-added in 1942, it consisted of multiple choice questions. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1946 test and associated changes   Paragraph reading was eliminated from the verbal portion of the SAT in 1946, and replaced with reading comprehension, and ""double definition"" questions were replaced with sentence completions. Between 1946 and 1957 students were given 90 to 100 minutes to complete 107 to 170 verbal questions. Starting in 1958 time limits became more stable, and for 17 years, until 1975, students had 75 minutes to answer 90 questions. In 1959 questions on data sufficiency were introduced to the mathematics section, and then replaced with quantitative comparisons in 1974. In 1974 both verbal and math sections were reduced from 75 minutes to 60 minutes each, with changes in test composition compensating for the decreased time. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1980 test and associated changes   The inclusion of the ""Strivers"" Score study was implemented. This study was introduced by The Educational Testing Service, which administers the SAT, and has been conducting research on how to make it easier for minorities and individuals who suffer from social and economic barriers. The original ""Strivers"" project, which was in the research phase from 19801994, awarded special ""Striver"" status to test-takers who scored 200 points higher than expected for their race, gender and income level. The belief was that this would give minorities a better chance at being accepted in to a college of higher standard, i.e. an Ivy League school. In 1992, the Strivers Project was leaked to the public; as a result the Strivers Project was terminated in 1993. After Federal Courts heard arguments from the ACLU, NAACP and the Educational Testing Service, the courts ordered the study to alter its data collection process, stating that only the age, race and zip code could be used to determine the test-takers eligibility for ""Strivers"" points. These changes were introduced to the SAT effective in 1994.     [ edit ]   1994 changes   In 1994 the verbal section received a dramatic change in focus. Among these changes were the removal of  antonym  questions, and an increased focus on passage reading. The mathematics section also saw a dramatic change in 1994, thanks in part to pressure from the  National Council of Teachers of Mathematics . For the first time since 1935, the SAT asked some non-multiple choice questions, instead requiring students to supply the answers. 1994 also saw the introduction of calculators into the mathematics section for the first time in the test's history. The mathematics section introduced concepts of probability, slope, elementary statistics, counting problems, median and mode. [ 19 ]   The average score on the 1994 modification of the SAT I was usually around 1000 (500 on the verbal, 500 on the math). The most selective schools in the United States (for example, those in the  Ivy League ) typically had SAT averages exceeding 1400 on the old test.     [ edit ]   2002 changes - Score Choice   In October 2002, the College Board dropped the Score Choice Option. Under this option, scores were not released to colleges until the student saw and approved of the score. [ 21 ]  The reasoning was that the option benefited wealthier students who could afford to take it multiple times. The College Board has since decided to re-implement Score Choice in the spring of 2009. It is described as optional, and it is not clear if the reports sent will indicate whether or not this student has opted-in or not. A number of highly selective colleges and universities have announced they will require applicants to submit all scores, including  Harvard ,  Cornell ,  Yale  and  Stanford . Others, such as  MIT , have embraced Score Choice.     [ edit ]   2005 changes   In 2005, the test was changed again, largely in response to criticism by the  University of California system . [ 22 ]  Because of issues concerning ambiguous questions, especially  analogies , certain types of questions were eliminated (the analogies from the verbal and quantitative comparisons from the Math section). The test was made marginally harder, as a corrective to the rising number of perfect scores. A new writing section, with an essay, based on the former SAT II Writing Subject Test, was added, in part to increase the chances of closing the opening gap between the highest and midrange scores. Other factors included the desire to test the writing ability of each student in a personal manner; hence the essay. The New SAT (known as the SAT Reasoning Test) was first offered on March 12, 2005, after the last administration of the ""old"" SAT in January 2005. The Mathematics section was expanded to cover three years of high school mathematics. The Verbal section's name was changed to the Critical Reading section.     [ edit ]   2008 changes   In 2008, or rather for the late 2008, 2009 testing, a new variable came into play. Before, it was required for applicants to most colleges to submit all scores with some colleges who embraced Score Choice to allow their students to do so. However, this year, an initiative to make Score Choice universal began, with some opposition from colleges desiring to maintain score report practices. While students theoretically now have the choice to submit their best score (in theory one could send any score they wish to send) to the college of their choice, some popular colleges and universities, such as Cornell, ask that students send all test scores. [ 23 ]  This had led the College Board to display on their web site which colleges agree with or dislike Score Choice, with continued claims that students will still never have scores submitted against their will.     [ edit ]   Name changes and recentered scores   Although originally standing for ""Scholastic Aptitude Test"" [ 24 ] , in 1990, because of uncertainty about the SAT's ability to function as an  intelligence test , the name was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test. In 1993 the name was changed to SAT I: Reasoning Test (with the  letters not standing for anything ) to distinguish it from the  SAT II: Subject Tests [ 24 ] . In 2004, the roman numerals on both tests were dropped, and the SAT I renamed the SAT Reasoning Test [ 24 ] . The scoring categories are now the following: Critical Reading (comparable to some of the Verbal portions of the old SAT I), Mathematics, and Writing. The writing section now includes an essay, whose score is involved in computing the overall score for the Writing section, as well as grammar sections (also comparable to some Verbal portions of the previous SAT).   The test scoring was initially scaled to make 500 the mean score on each section with a  standard deviation  of 100. [ 25 ]  As the test grew more popular and more students from less rigorous schools began taking the test, the average dropped to about 428 Verbal and 478 Math. The SAT was ""recentered"" in 1995, and the average ""new"" score became again close to 500. Scores awarded after 1994 and before October 2001 are officially reported with an ""R"" (e.g. 1260R) to reflect this change. Old scores may be recentered to compare to 1995 to present scores by using official College Board tables [ 26 ]  , which in the middle ranges add about 70 points to Verbal and 20 or 30 points to Math. In other words, current students have a 100 (70 plus 30) point advantage over their parents.     [ edit ]   Controversy     [ edit ]   Scoring problems of October 2005 tests   In March 2006, it was announced that a small percentage of the SATs taken in October 2005 had been scored incorrectly due to the test papers being moist and not scanning properly, and that some students had received substantially erroneous scores. The College Board announced they would change the scores for the students who were given a lower score than they earned, but at this point many of those students had already applied to colleges using their original scores. The College Board decided not to change the scores for the students who were given a higher score than they earned. A lawsuit was filed in 2005 by about 4,400 students who received an incorrect low score on the SAT. The class-action suit was settled in August 2007 when The College Board and another company that administers the college-admissions test announced they would pay $2.85 million to over 4,000 students. Under the agreement each student can either elect to receive $275 or submit a claim for more money if he or she feels the damage was even greater. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Criticism     [ edit ]   Bias                        As depicted above, SAT scores vary according to race, income, and parental educational background.       A famous example of alleged bias in the SAT I was the  oarsman - regatta  analogy question. [ 28 ]  The object of the question was to find the pair of terms that have the relationship most similar to the relationship between ""runner"" and ""marathon."" The correct answer was ""oarsman"" and ""regatta."" Choice of the correct answer presupposed students' familiarity with a sport popular with the wealthy, and so upon their knowledge of its structure and terminology. Fifty-three percent (53%) of white students - who in greater numbers come from higher income households - correctly answered the question, while only 22% of black students - who disproportionately came from lower income households - also scored correctly. [ 29 ]  Analogy questions have since been replaced by short reading passages.     [ edit ]   Dropping SAT   A growing number of  liberal arts colleges  have responded to this criticism by joining the  SAT optional movement . These colleges do not require the SAT for admission.   In a 2001 speech to the  American Council on Education ,  Richard C. Atkinson , then president of the  University of California , urged dropping the SAT Reasoning Test as a college admissions requirement:     ""Anyone involved in education should be concerned about how overemphasis on the SAT is distorting educational priorities and practices, how the test is perceived by many as unfair, and how it can have a devastating impact on the self-esteem and aspirations of young students. There is widespread agreement that overemphasis on the SAT harms American education."" [ 30 ]     In response to threats by the University of California to drop the SAT as an admission requirement, the College Entrance Examination Board announced the restructuring of the SAT, to take effect in March 2005, as detailed above.     [ edit ]   Essay   In 2005,  MIT  Writing Director  Les Perelman  plotted essay length versus essay score on the new SAT from released essays and found a high correlation between them. After studying 23 graded essays he found that the longer the essay was the higher the score. He also discovered that several of these essays were full of factual errors. However, the official SAT guide for scorers state that the essays should be scored according to their quality of writing and not factual accuracy. The National Council of Teachers of English also criticize the 25-minute writing section of the test, arguing that the basic principles of writing encourage the revision of written material several times. They say that the amount of time allowed for the test pushes schools to develop a formulaic system of writing. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Test preparation   Many companies and organizations offer test preparation in the form of books, classes, online courses, tutoring and only recently, board games [ 32 ] . Large organizations include  Kaplan  and  the Princeton Review . Some have criticized the SAT because preparation often can lead to much higher scores, but some have embraced the opportunity to improve their scores.

clueweb09-en0008-56-39562	"Diversity Panel NAML Fall 2001 Meeting Hatfield Marine Science Center, Newport, OR Oct. 4-6, 2001   Foreword   The Southern Association of Marine Labs (SAML) has maintained a keen interest and involvement in increasing diversity in marine science careers, in general, and at marine labs, in particular since its founding in 1985.  During the late 1980's SAML received an NSF grant to determine possible ways of increasing diversity, and during the 1990's produced two videos for encouraging minority participation in marine sciences.  Drs. Matt Gilligan and Sue Cook of Savannah State University and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, respectively, led in the production and distribution of these videos.   When National Association of Marine Laboratories (NAML) President, Dr. Lavern Weber (2000-2001), expressed that one of his goals during his presidency would be to focus on marine education, I thought as SAML President (2000-2001), that we should share our SAML diversity expertise at the NAML Biennial Mtg.  After SAML Board of Directors and Membership discussions, Matt Gilligan, SAML Education Committee Chair, accepted the challenge.  He subsequently formed a blue-ribbon panel of diversity experts for the meeting at the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, Oregon, 4-6 October 2001.  The panel presentation was entitled ""Marine Education Diversity, Retention, and Recruitment"", and panelists included:  Dr. Benjamin Cuker, Hampton University; Dr. Judith Vergun, Oregon State University; Dr. Brian Bingham, Western Washington University; Dr. Dionne Hoskins, NMFS, NOAA, Savannah State University; and, Dr. Brad Brown, NMFS, NOAA, Miami, Florida.  SAML funded the travel for these five national diversity leaders to the Oregon meeting.   On behalf of SAML and NAML, I gratefully acknowledge and thank Dr. Matt Gilligan and all five panelists for their participation and documentation of this significant issue.   Wes Tunnell        SAML President        (2000-2001)    Transcript  Gilligan:  Thanks, Wes.  I'm happy to be here to moderate this panel discussion on strategies to increase minority participation at marine laboratories and in marine sciences.  We have an hour this morning and we will have a half hour after lunch for the session.  It is our hope that perhaps the presentations this morning can be used to help focus discussion groups, chaired by panelists during lunch.  Since we won't have a lot of time for much discussion this morning, I ask you to save questions until lunch or the afternoon session. The panelists will summarize the lunchtime discussions during the session after lunch.  The proceedings are being taped and we hope to turn it into a report for the membership. What you have in the handout are literature and other resources that this panel has helped put together.  It includes the SAML video on CD ROM entitled ""Bridging the Gap: Minorities in Marine Science"". It was a very popular item at a National Marine Education Association meeting and is distributed directly to teachers and others, especially to places that do not have staff in Marine Science, Ocean Science, or Natural Science areas by Savannah State University. It includes Ben Cuker's recent article in the ASLO bulletin ""Steps to increase minority participation in aquatic Sciences"", and a 1996 article by me, ""Promoting Diversity in Fisheries Profession"".  Also included are highlights from the most recent Expanding Opportunities Conference at Jackson State University coordinated by Ambrose Gerald.  Reports from all of the annual conferences can be obtained through him, at the NOAA Fisheries Northeast Science Center in Woods Hole. Finally, two emails are included: one from Sue Weiler who has put together a Minorities in Aquatic Science (MAS) database and web page at the ASLO website and one from Kelly Clark, at Morgan State University who is putting together a website on minorities in marine and environmental sciences.   Our distinguished panelists today include from right to left, Dr. Benjamin Cuker, Hampton University; Dr. Brian Bingham, Western Washington University; Dr. Bradford Brown, NOAA Fisheries and President of the Miami-Dade chapter of the NAACP; Dr. Judith Vergun, Oregon State University; and Dr. Dionne Hoskins, NOAA Fisheries, Galveston and Savannah State University. With that very brief introduction, I now ask each of the panelists to address the issue from their perspectives responding, specifically, to some of the questions that are on in the handout.  Brown:  I am with NOAA Fisheries Service and currently serve as the Senior Advisor to the Director of National Marine Fishery Service and this includes a series of areas of special responsibility, one of them being the Fisheries Service's responsibilities in NOAA's Minority Serving Institution Initiative.  Prior to that I served for over a decade as the Director of South East Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fishery Service which is the equivalent of the North West Center which has a unit here in Newport.  Prior to that, I was the Deputy Director and before that I spent most of my career in the National Marine Fisheries Laboratory in Woods Hole where I dealt with stock assessment issues.  I also spent 5 years as assistant professor of Zoology and Assistant Leader of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Cooperative Fisheries Unit at Oklahoma State University.  And in all of that time, I have been involved in efforts to increase diversity in fisheries.   I would like to let you know some of the background of today's efforts and also some of the things that have not changed.  As far as I know, the very first African American summer hire at a Federal marine fisheries lab was in 1962. He came the same year I started with the then Bureau of Commercial Fisheries.  In those days, summer hires in Federal Laboratories were political referrals. This referral came from the newly elected President John F. Kennedy who had an interest in the marine area.  As you may remember he watched his inaugural parade and saw an all white Coast Guard Unit, as a result, he made sure he got folks into the Coast Guard Academy.  He also saw that we had a summer hire at the Federal Marine Fisheries Laboratory in Woods Hole, a student from a very distinguished family, graduated from a private school and heading on to Harvard.  The interesting thing, and I think often it is still true, the only person he visited with outside of the laboratory, in that entire summer was me.  He had a lot more money than I did right out of graduate school.  I was still with my orange crate furniture and bookcases, but never the less I was the only one in that entire laboratory that reached out.  The opportunity to have to gotten him interested in going on into marine science was basically lost because of that.    I want to jump ahead a little bit; this is not the first panel I have been on regarding this subject.  That was at the American Fisheries Society in 1981, and again at the Oceans 82 conference.  I just want to read what I wrote in the Marine Technology Journal in 1983 (Hannaham, 1983), following that conference.  ""The fundamental principle regarding the role of minorities in marine affairs is the observation that while a number of minorities, Black Americans in particular, have had a long history of involvement in the maritime and marine sectors of the economy of the United States being represented in the merchant marine, on the docks, whaling vessels, in fish processing plants, etc., they have only miniscule representation in those areas in the marine sectors that involve professional and scientific management and marine policy.  It is axiomatic that the lack of involvement at the latter levels of the economy have both robbed the United States of an important segment of potential talent needed to address critical problems but it also sets the stage for decisions to be made that may directly or more insidiously indirectly adversely affect those components of society not represented at the table.  Historically, minorities have not been welcomed in marine professions, or at many of the institutions which train people for these professions.  Furthermore this history creates a vicious cycle that perpetuates itself both by ensuring that the incoming generation is made ignorant of the opportunities available in marine areas.  This lack of role models can become critical"".  I dare say this is not outdated, even though it is 20 years old.   I just want to give a little more history.  Not so long ago, I took a look at the Class of 1958 year book from Burke High School in Charleston, South Carolina, the historic Black High School.  The Valedictorian and the Salutatorian, both were listed as wanting to be scientists, both of them ended up being high school science teachers.  When they graduated from South Carolina State University (SCSU) in the early 60's, they were never informed that the only requirement for getting a job with the Federal Government as a biologist was to fill out a form and send in your transcript.  And in those days we had a shortage of fishery biologists!  We were grabbing people to come into the field who had general biology backgrounds.  With a fisheries background and a master's degree, I got written job offers from maybe 10 laboratories spread throughout the country. Many others who were hired didn't have a fisheries background.  All the SCSU students were told was that they could take the Federal Services Entrance Exam and go into Administration probably in D.C.  So we deliberately kept people out at a time when it would have been so easy to bring persons into the system.    If we look at current imperatives, I think we need to be sure that we are honestly aware of the population demographics changing in this country. It is true in our professions we have a long lag time, as we are not hiring persons right out of high school.  Thus the time the population changes impact people getting PhD's is a long time after the shifts we see in the public school system, but never the less, it is coming.  We already are seeing it, in the changes in Congress and State Legislatures.    I would like to tell another story of the first African American woman who was hired by Fisheries to go to sea in Miami.  As soon as she was hired, she was taken aboard an old vessel, shown a common living space with an open shower and told if she did not like it, she ought to quit right then.  When she complained about this treatment it was suggested that she take a non-sea going job.  When she was sent to her location assignment, her new supervisor suggested that the job was boring and they were never able to keep scientists at it, but if he was ordered to take her he would.  So that is the history that we come from not too many years ago.    We are seeing changes of course, particularly in the political structure.  I see it very clearly in some of the efforts that I am involved in South Florida's ecosystem restoration in which we are planning to spend 8 billion dollars to ""Restore the Everglades Ecosystem"".   The local people have to vote for it.  We have had a system that has been driven primarily by white environmentalists often opposed by agriculture, developers and the power and water supply folks, etc., and yet you have virtually no representation of our large African American and Hispanic groups in this process and one questions how successfully will support for restoration be maintained unless we make a major effort towards inclusion. Those who are looking for legislators and for others to be sympathetic towards ecological concerns and receiving their political support need to break through the diversity barrier for success.   In a presentation made to the American Fishery Society back in 1992 right after the release of the 1990 Census, Essie Duffie and I said that anyone who looks at candidates running in this years election realizes that we are living in a era where women are seeking office in impressive numbers and that the recent redistricting greatly increases the representation of African American and Hispanics in the legislatures.   How are fisheries agencies going to fare? How are natural resources going to fare, especially if our presentations to elected officials are made by mostly white males?   Today we have made a break through to a significant degree where we at least can send white females out from many Federal agencies.  But we still send all white delegations.  Well we have got to change some of our strategies, we have got to get people on our staff or our issues will be in peril if we don't.    The cardinal thing that we have to do is realize that (I am speaking specifically about African Americans now,) potential employees are available.  This is different from what the situation was not too many years ago, thanks to the work of people like Dr. Gilligan and Dr. Cuker.  But there are not enough available to saturate the market so that in order to make breakthroughs you have to essentially find a position for a person rather than a person for the position.  If we wait until we advertise for the position, the chances are, we will not find anybody on the application list.  What I mean by the first is that if I ask somebody in one of our laboratories, say Galveston, to list what new staff they need, they would come up with probably at least a 50% increase in their scientific staff that they absolutely have to have to be able to meet the demands that are placed on them by the fishery managers.  However they have limited funds so they are filling only one position.  If you were to say that if we find an African American, or a Hispanic, who can make a significant contribution in one of those other positions that are further down the list of priorities but are still needed in the system, and hired them, we could dramatically increase the representation in the work force.  It does not take much to dramatically increase it. If one brings in new people who can reach out and involve other people previously left out, there is a cascading effect.    There is also the availability of African and Caribbean marine scientists coming to our institutions particularly at the graduate student level.  I have talked in Africa to people who are fascinated by, and have great interest in Black America yet when they come here they never see anybody because they are completely isolated.  You have got to be able to find, and make the opportunities so those links can be made. There are many individuals who would be grateful for that link to individuals in the Black communities of this country.    Finally I want to say that we have got to take advantage of the NOAA Minority Serving Institute (MSI) Initiative.  NOAA has just released funding for Science Centers, 2.5 million each. The plan is that if the money is renewed in Congress it will go for 3 years and probably be renewed for another 3 years at the same schools.  These are in Atmospheric, Remote Sensing, Marine Environment and Living Marine Resources.  The schools that are involved in the in the last two are Hampton, Savannah, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Delaware State, Jackson State, Morgan State, South Carolina State and Florida A&M Universities.  They are basically the schools that had taken a step forward in this area, and now they are getting a significant infusion of funds.  One can piggyback those activities.  NOAA also has an Environmental Entrepreneurship Program which is giving $300,000 grants each, to about 12 schools.  This is an annual program and provides another opportunity for linkages.  One of the places to look for a model of success is the National Council for Minorities in Engineering, (NACME).  I will end with a conclusion from one of NACME's studies giving the requisites for progress. ""Strong institutional commitment as evidenced by attitudes of faculty and staff, integral minority engineering programs and allocation of resources"".  This further points out that you need support at the top but you have got to avoid the sabotage down below.  Efforts all along these lines are needed for science to diversify.  Bingham:   I am here because of my connection with the Minorities in Marine Science Undergraduate Program (MIMSUP) administered through the Shannon Point Marine Center.  The program was started in 1991 by Dr. Steve Sulkin. He can provide advice on how a marine center can get such a program launched.  In the short time I have, I would like to tell you about our program and some of the lessons we have learned over the past 11 years.  MIMSUP is unique for a couple of reason.  First, it is an academic year program rather than a summer internship.  We recruit students out of their home institutions and invite them to come to Washington State for 5 months.  This can raise difficulties because students are generally in an academic track working through predetermined course sequences.  They have to be willing and able to jump out of those tracks for two quarters.  The second unusual feature of MIMSUP is that we are running a program for underrepresented groups in an area that doesn't have a large resident minority population to draw from. We have to attract students from other institutions and have faced the recruiting challenges shared by many people working with underrepresented students.  Some believe that there are simply not enough qualified people to fill the positions. We have faced some significant challenges, but have seen great success with our students. I would like to share some ideas with you, focusing on what has worked, and not worked, for us.  MIMSUP is 2 full quarters long, running from January to June. In the first quarter we work to accomplish four things:  1. We give the students coursework in basic marine science.  This is accomplished through a focused oceanography course that includes lecture and lab with an active experiential field component.  2. We work on remediation with participants who may not be completely prepared for our courses. We focus on math and writing, using a tutorial approach, to get them up to speed. They need to be prepared to successfully step into senior-level courses during the second quarter.    3. We work with them to build up their resumes/CVs. When students leave MIMSUP, they have things on their CV that make them competitive for REU programs or graduate school. As part of the CV building, the students complete an independent research project that is structured as a mini-graduate experience. The process includes interviewing potential advisors, developing a research proposal and carrying out a project.  4. We give them a realistic view of what marine science really is and what job opportunities are available. We take them to potential employers in all sectors including government, academia, private consulting, non-governmental organizations and aquaria. Over the years, we have developed a group of supportive individuals who will sit down and frankly tell the students what is good about the job, what is bad, what the salaries and benefits are, how they prepared for their positions and what they wish they had done differently.  When we are done, the students have a good overview of the possible places they can go with a marine science degree.  This all happens in the first quarter. It is an extremely focused and time-consuming effort on the part of the faculty and staff of the marine center.  To be successful, a program like this has to be a priority for everyone. It helps enormously to have many people involved and contributing. With that kind of support network, you can accomplish great things with the students.    In the second quarter, the students take specialty courses with other students from the general Western Washington University student body; they are thus incorporated into a larger community.  They also take a course where we teach them scientific communication skills, focusing on writing and speaking. We built the course around the research the MIMSUP students completed in the first quarter.  When we have finished, the students have written up their research as a manuscript article, they have created and presented their work as a scientific poster and they have given a research talk in a mini-symposium. The culmination of their scientific communication training is a trip to a regional or national scientific meeting where they again present their posters and talks. This is an extremely important experience that demonstrates to them that they can participate in broad scientific arenas.  At the same time, it is an important CV-building exercise.    That is a brief overview of what we do.  I would raise a few helpful points we have learned. First, a small lab with no resident minority population can make a difference.  It does not necessarily require a close connection with a minority institution or with a majority institution housing a large population of underrepresented students.  All it really takes is a commitment on the part of individuals to spend serious time working with students. The outcomes can be outstanding. We are seeing many of our program alumni going into graduate programs in the marine and environmental sciences.  I believe MIMSUP is making a difference.  Second, any program of this type is going to have enormous challenges.  For example, student participants may have very different backgrounds and levels of preparation. Some, on paper, don't look very good and would not be competitive for jobs or graduate programs.  Yet we find, when we work to understand the student's background and weaknesses, we can really take them places.  Finding these promising students may require rethinking how we evaluate applications.  Applicants for whom we can do the most good are not likely to be the 3.8 students with extensive marine experience. Instead he/she may be a 2.8 student who has never been out of southern Texas. In many cases, the students have simply never been in the right situation to realize their potential.  When you bring them in, work with them and give them opportunities, you see amazing things happen.    Strengthening these students may require that we build some remediation into our programs.  Our decisions to include more writing and math in what we do came out of our experiences in the first few years.  We tried to give early participants a great program but they were simply unprepared to assimilate it. You can not teach a student oceanography without a good math base; we had to back up a bit and do some catching up.    A challenge we often see with our students is a simple lack of confidence.  In reality, we can't teach confidence. However, we can give students the tools to make them successful.  Success breeds confidence.  Our students are isolated in the woods of northwest Washington in an environment that is totally foreign biologically, culturally, socially and academically. It can be a daunting challenge and not one that would necessarily inspire self-confidence. But, as our faculty and staff, who are genuinely interested in the students, work with them daily, helping them develop skills and building their resumes, we begin to see changes. They become more confident and motivated.  It is a wonderful process  The major challenge to our program over the years has been recruiting.  When people ask, ""How do you recruit?"" we answer, ""Any way we possibly can"". When we started the program, we took the logical, generally accepted approach of sending out mass mailings. In fact, that turned out to be the least effective way to find applicants.  We continue to do mass mailings in the hope that the information will reach potential applicants, but it is not a terribly effective way to recruit.    What HAS worked for the past decade is to get on the phone and call our professional colleagues asking, ""Do you have a student?"" Successful recruiting requires someone to go out in the hall, the classroom or the lab, grab a student by the arm, pull them into the office and ask, ""Have you thought of this?"" Conversations with our alumni indicate that many had seen our flyers but thought, ""Oh, I can't do that. My GPA is not high enough.  I don't have any experience. I would never get in"".  Fortunately, we have found faculty champions in a few universities and marine labs who really make an effort to look around and encourage students. They are making a difference for our program and for these students.  Q:  Do you have a website?  A:  We have had a website for 9 years. It is a well-designed site with everything from program description and student research to student outcomes. We have not tracked the number of hits the page receives. However, this year we added an on-line application and found that our applications came in much sooner. We know, therefore, that we are reaching students. It appears that allowing students to apply on line is going to help our recruiting.  We are still not getting large numbers of applications, but we do seem to be reaching people a little easier.   Q:  So just having information on the website is important, but just as important is having the means to apply on the site?  A:  Yes. That has been an important improvement for us.   Q:   About how many students do you bring into this program?  A:  We bring in 8 students a year. That allows us to work closely with individual students.  Q:  Do you track to see what happens after students leave the program?  A:  Yes, we track them very closely. Students in our program find themselves in a small field laboratory, generally far from home.  In these circumstances, they really bond to one another and to the laboratory.  We don't have to put a lot of effort into tracking them.  They are our friends and friends stay in touch.  We hear from most of them regularly; they have been very successful.  Of our 87 alumni, 2 have completed PhD's and are currently in post-doctoral positions. Six more are currently working on PhD's. Twelve alumni have finished MS degrees and 17 more are currently in MS program.  A number of the remaining students are still working on undergraduate degrees and several are currently applying for graduate programs.  Vergun  I am a professor in the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University  (OSU) in Corvallis, Oregon. I am a scientist - a plant community ecologist. Most of the work I do focuses on Native American programs such as research in natural resources, education, and traditional ecological knowledge on reservations and ceded lands also working in Native America on the Mainland and in Alaska and Hawaii.  The Native Americans in Marine and Space Sciences Program, our parent program began about 12 years ago because we were interested in increasing the number of Native students in Marine Sciences. Our initial and sustaining funding is from the National Science Foundation Ocean Sciences Division. When OSU became a NASA Space Grant institution and I became Oregon Space Grant Associate Director, we dedicated funds to expand our Native programs. What that really means is that we provide paid internships for Native undergraduates in all science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines - anything slightly wet, slightly salty, anything to do with the environment - which is just about everything!  Students in our program at OSU participate in full year research experiences for undergraduates. During the academic year, they are allowed to work up to 20 hours a week in a research experience of there own choice, with a mentor of their own choice then full time during summers and holidays, if they wish.  This program is offered to Native students who are enrolled in Oregon State University but participate in programs in other institutions, especially Brian Bingham's and Ben Cuker's. This is one of the really valuable things - networking with other strong programs that support minorities. Please take a look at the sheet I've handed out to you. It is a description of our programs and a chart that shows our parent program, the Native Americans in Marine and Space Sciences Program, and the outreach in three areas: Pre-college Programs, Education, and Community Projects with links to our Pacific Traditional Ecological Knowledge Program for Native graduate students.    We developed this program network because it was immediately apparent, when we began our NAMSS program almost 12 years ago, that it didn't do any good to have a wonderful program for Native students at the university if almost no Native students were attending the university!  Therefore, we served the few students who were then attending OSU while we quickly developed an outreach strategy to bring more Native youth to our university.    Also important to remember, is that once students are enrolled in the university, they need to feel a sense of belonging. Students are not comfortable in a learning institution where their cultures are marginalized or invisible in the curricula. Therefore we design and continue to teach coursework that is culturally competent and that attains Native community 'buy in' to our post-secondary education.  We continue to develop these courses through our Intertribal Programs Office in the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences to serve the whole university.  Native undergraduates in our program are working with the Native youth in all of these outreach programs in many communities, therefore, they are visible role models. And we keep in touch with everyone - students and community throughout the years. In other words, we track our students beyond graduation at OSU.  Also, we have mentors from not only the scientific arena and engineering at our university but also from Federal and state agencies and private corporations. We have a real breadth of opportunity for our students to understand what is going on out there in the world and get some ideas for their career choices - most students don't have an idea of what choices they have and, therefore, cannot make very good choices. They are limited in their own environment.  To a certain degree, I think that this is true for most students but especially for Native youth from reservations or isolated, rural settings. They have a harder time because they see that life only and it is not always the bigger picture of the world and all the opportunities that exist.  So that is why we have this huge network of programs and opportunities - to introduce students to a broad array of choices.  Many different foundations fund us and we are working with many different organizations to put this whole outreach program together and keep it running.  We probably have approximately 400 people on staff throughout this whole network; therefore, we've provided a huge holistic network for K-12 and post-secondary and for communities. That is the main reason we have been successful.  Statistically, in 12 years, 98% of more than 100 students have earned Bachelor of Science degrees within 5 years or less. Forty-seven percent have continued in graduate programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  Many of our students are now employed as senior scientists in their fields.  Because we have this network of graduated NAMSS participants nation-wide, our current students have been able to participate in more and more opportunities nationally and go on exchanges to spend time with those peers. They become part of a bigger global family in a network larger than the one we provide in our home location.  These programs have been so successful that our African American and Chicano/a families asked us to develop the same opportunities for their students. So we developed the Diversity Internship Program (DIP) which has been on the ground here for five years with the same results. It has been really exciting!  A funny thing happened when we named the program. In our haste to name the program, we didn't notice that the acronym was DIP. So the students are DIPS!  But we've made it fun by having a theme song ""Dippity Do-Dah"" and chip-dip contests and things like that.  Effective programs need to be personal to create a family that works together and solves problems together.   My background? I have actually changed careers a couple of times. For 15 years I was in advertising, film and television.  I made television commercials, was involved in movie making and that sort of thing.  When my three daughters were very young, I decided I would like to change professions by going back to school and earning advanced degrees in something environmentally friendly, rather than continue to work in advertising all the products that were destroying the environment.  And I wanted a nice, safe, comfortable, affordable place for my children to grow up. I chose Oregon and we leased a farm near Corvallis, Oregon and Oregon State University. My temporary move here was in 1978!    I want to say something about growing up.  I'm American Indian on my father's side and my Mother is Scottish and Welsh.  My father was a Geologist and he would take me with him when he was working and he would tell me things about how to survive outdoors.  He taught me how to find water and food.  If you are really hungry in the winter, coyotes can help you hunt. I thought everybody learned that stuff growing up.  I thought that was Geology and when you go to school and you take Geology you learn that. There are all those sorts of things that he taught me in addition to what is taught in mainstream schools. So when I went to school and we were out on some of our field trips, some people were talking about how they did not like the red ants. I said, ""But they are good for finding water.""  And nobody understood what I meant. And I realized I was the only one who had the concept. Dad taught me to appreciate everything in nature, because everything in nature has its place. So if there is a red anthill in a very high dry desert area, you will find water underneath the anthill but you must not disturb their homeplace. Therefore you do not drill down through the anthill; you drill in diagonally at an angle that reaches just below their home.  You respect their home, thank them for showing you where the water is and don't disturb them - and otherwise, you might get stung!    Here's what I learned about the coyotes and hunting in the winter: if you are really, really hungry, and you are out in a winter camp, and you hear coyotes, you listen to which kind of call they use.  Are they teaching their young how to talk and how to communicate? Or are you hearing the sound of yapping because of a kill.  You need to learn the different sounds and what they mean. If the coyotes have gotten a deer or something and they are not that far from you, you can sneak up very quietly and surprise them quickly, run and grab a hunk of meat and run away really fast and they won't bother you. You just take a small amount and they won't follow you because they have all the rest for themselves. You have caught them by surprise and have a short window of time to run in and get something and leave.  Pack rats carry a lot of interesting things to their dens like nuts and seeds and other plant materials.  You can actually learn a lot about the ecosystem from this cache - or you can eat the nuts and the seeds!  These are the kind of things that I thought everybody knew. When I got into formal science courses I learned not to mention these things because I looked kind of ridiculous in those classes and people thought I was weird.  And the point of this is that, in fact, those things I learned from Dad are true. I grew up understanding science from that perspective.  And it is also true that most of our science curricula still do not include that indigenous perspective. I see that our Native or minority students are marginalized or completely invisible in most current curricula or educational programs.  For education, programs and organizations to be successful and diverse, different ways of knowing and thinking must be respected and incorporated in a relevant way. I just wanted to tell that personal story to demonstrate that how you feel about something or someplace is what's important. If you feel that you are silly or stupid, you don't want to stay.    Hoskins:  My name is Dionne Hoskins, as Matt said I am a fisheries biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service.  I am permanently stationed at Savannah State University.  I am not a temporary loan or a tenure-year track faculty; I am a permanent research scientist at a historically black serving university.  I completed my dissertation at the University of South Carolina and am a benthic ecologist by training.  I am particularly interested in the uptake of microbial extracellular polymeric secretions  (EPS) by deposit feeding invertebrates.  That is my research area.  My programmatic background is that I have participated in virtually every program that has been offered here except for Brian's.  I am a graduate of Savannah State University- I was taught by Matt Gilligan. I was in the first cohort of students who participated in the Hampton-ASLO partnership that Ben does, and I have participated in that student program since 1989.  I was a graduate assistant for the Bridge program that Savannah State offers with the NSF. I was a Southern Regional Education Board dissertation fellow. And I was a co-op student through Brad at the Charleston NOS laboratory.  So I have participated in a number of these programs.  And things that are geared to the success of minority students, and I think they work, for the most part.    Currently what I am doing at Savannah State, in addition to starting up my own research,  is continuing to work on microbial EPS. I am focusing on a local cyanobacterial mat. I want to characterize the sugars present.   But what I am doing programmatically is trying to increase the number of underrepresented minorities that get funneled into jobs into NOAA or into academia, or into other Government services.  One of the grants I have received to do so is a Sea Grant sponsored program. It is an aquaculture program that we are doing in partnership with the South Carolina Department of Natural Marine Resources and with the University of Georgia Marine Extension Service.  From that program we choose 4 interns per year, 2 interns go to MAREX UGA one stays on campus and works with me and one goes the Waddell Mariculture Center. On campus at Savannah State, to develop hands on learning in aquaculture, we have started a Spartina alterniflora greenhouse.  Savannah State University is on the Marsh.  Our back yard is total marsh, so what we are doing is using our back yard, and growing those plants, and cultivating them to get a renewable crop inside the green house that we can use for restoration.    Additionally, I have started a Minority Mentorship in Science Seminar series (MMISS), a program to bring minority scientists that look like me to Savannah State University.  One of the first things that I noticed when I got to campus was that the students were very hungry to not just see minority scientists but to see younger ones.  You just don't know how entertained they were to see me to be in the lab, washing glassware, listening to the same music as they were.  It was really, really interesting, for me to experience. So the MMISS program is designed to fly in at least one scientist per month. I have gotten such a strong response, even with limited funds, individuals are willing to come free, that it looks like I might be able to bring in 2-3 per month, between now and May.  Another program that we have started is the academic computing facility.  I got this program with a post doc who was at Savannah State University, Ashanti Johnson Pyrtle. And she and I were responding to the need for more technological growth for undergraduates.  We developed a computing facility in which students can come in with raw data on paper from their internships or from classes, enter them into excel or access and analyze the data.  If they have other types of geographical data they will be trained how to enter that into ArcView and use GIS.  They can come in with raw data, perform the analysis and get the product.  With a research poster, a power point presentation or anything of that nature, the purpose of this was to show students the beginning and the end of how science is done.  We are really happy with that.    Part of what I wanted to offer as part of my participation in this panel, is what we have talked about, that there are minorities available, that there are minority scientists, and that 20-30-40 years ago this was not the case.  We have talked about how there are programs that work in terms of preparing undergraduates to consider careers in Marine and Environmental sciences. And part of that is, what to do when someone has gotten an advanced degree, what do we do with them when they are ready to enter into the work force? How do we receive them so they have viability at a marine laboratory?  How do you get them to stay and to flourish versus getting there and getting turned off of research or getting there and feeling that it is an inhospitable environment?  One of the first things I would say is that there should be recognition and sensitivity to cultural differences.  That is very intuitive and often times difficult for a person to execute in a scientific community.  It is pretty homogeneous.  As a federal employee, one of the first things I noticed when I went to a federal lab is that diversity is assumed, it is automatically assumed, and that if you go to some academic institutions, diversity is ignored.  People enjoy the homogeneity of having all these scientists focusing on a single area like the microbial group or the ecology group of professors, or the physical oceanography group of professors. We don't really see the recognition, much less the celebration of diversity in that group.  But there should be recognition of the diversity and sensitivity that those individuals are bringing to a marine laboratory, and there should be an avoidance of the n=1 approach. I was looking for something else on the Internet and I bumped into an article that Dr. Clifford Poodry (who directs the minority outreach programs of NIH) had written about using n=1 as our sample size.    How we are going to handle minorities in a particular program? Sometimes someone like me is using her own personal experience to determine how she is going to develop programs. Or sometimes it's a laboratory or an academic institution that has only had one minority, or two minorities and they are using the experience of that minority to determine how they are going to handle others.  And I personally have seen situations, where one graduate student comes in and that graduate student sets a tone or has an experience and the faculty member thinks, "" I have a model. I am going to use what I have learned from working with this student and I'm going to work with the next students."" Look at  it from this perspective however, it is like having Denzel Washington as one student, and then Chris Rock comes in and you handle him the same way.  It does not work, it can't. Sarah Bernhardt and Winona Ryder? You cannot use the same system.  You can not use the same formulaic method to deal with those individuals. There has to be sensitivity to the growth that a faculty member or a lab may experience, by interaction with their first or first few minority researchers, but there is enough literature available on minority education in the sciences to give us an idea of what the broad-based strategy should be.  And then you can tailor those strategies to proceed with a productive investigation at your laboratory.  There is a dire need of intellectual engagement for minority scientists.   Its important that a researcher at any institution be engaged scientifically and not be placed in a situation where the only time that we [the minority] can talk to them [the peer scientists] when they have a new cutting social issue that they want to talk about.  ""Let's talk about affirmative action,"" ""No, I want to talk about bacterial slime."" Sometimes I do want to talk about the current issues that affect me, that affect the institution and are of national importance, but sometimes a scientist just wants to be engaged about his or her science.  If you are not regularly getting that, then basically you are being passively ostracized.  Not actively ostracized, because ""I don't want to talk to you"" but passively ostracized because you are being passed over when those kinds of conversations are happening.  That is frustrating and it creates a hostile environment and you don't see yourself putting roots down.  To yourself you say ""ok, this is temporary- I will be here 2, 3 years. I will be in this post doc, for one year, and I will leave and I will not consider applying for a position here"", or ""I will just be a visiting teaching position."" And then the minority scientist will leave, not feeling like a major contributor.   And this leads into the fact that minority researchers, minority students and researchers, need the same kind of faculty membership and directional development that every other brand new graduate and Ph.D. is going to need. They are going to need advice, input and support by individuals who have reached that same professional milestone and have gone past it, to understand ""How do you navigate your career?"" and ""How you engineer the career that you want to have?"" And this maybe in the form of guidance on office and scientific politics.  ""What editor of what journal do you not want to send your manuscript to because they have issues?""  Or ""what journal, if you really need a publication to come out this year, what journal do you not need to send it to vs. another journal because their turnover time is 6 or 9 months?""  For things of that nature we need an individual, or persons to call on for lack of a better term- Frentorship, the friendship and mentorship that helps us grow and become the productive scientists that they want to be.  This is a key to a person's sustainability regardless of their race.   I am going to add one resource to the list of books, texts and websites that is on the handout that was passed out earlier.  The book is called ""Succeeding in an Academic Career:  A Guide for Faculty of Color"" It was published in July of 2000 and was edited by Mildred Garcia (Garcia 2000).  I recently read this and it is a chapter-by-chapter guide on how to navigate your career if you are a faculty person of color, especially if you are at a majority institution.  It talks about issues of productivity and office politics; it also talks about issues of balance, if you are a person like me who is pulled in a direction to address issues of minority in sciences but is also very important to advance in the development of your own science.  It also addresses times and places where you have the obligation or feel compelled to mentor the students who come to you at universities, especially if you are the only minority person in your area- as I am at Savannah State University.  As some other faculty are at other universities.  You get pulled in all kinds of directions to be that voice of diversity.  This book has a chapter on how to be effective in being who you are, or how to continue to grow while at the same time contributing.  I have asked that the Vice President of Academic Affairs give this as a gift to all incoming faculty, saying ""Here use this guide, come to me with any questions.""  I would also like to say that I will be around for the rest of the meeting and happy to take questions.  Cuker:  I am Ben Cuker and I am from Hampton University.  Hampton is a historically black college, it started its marine sciences program in early 1980's and traces its beginning to the efforts of Anita Hall a woman who worked on her Ph.D. at Scripts but never got it, because of the politics of the era.  We have graduated over a 100 students now in Marine and Environmental Science all but 2-3 have been African American Students. Some have gone on for there Ph.D.' s and they are employed at the U.S. EPA and at several different universities and consulting firms.  It has been a successful program. Another thing I do is run the ASLO (American Society of Limnology and Oceanography).  This well known program goes back to 1989.   Prior to moving to Hampton in 1988, I spent 7 years working at Shaw University also an HBCU. When I used to go to ASLO meetings, the one or two black folks there would be visiting scientists from Africa.  So I whined about it a lot and got up and complained about it a lot at the ASLO business meetings, and wrote letters to the leadership.  Eventually one of the Presidents (and a former professor of mine from Michigan), Claire Schelske, appointed a committee with me as chair to address the diversity issue.   SAML played an essential role in this, because SAML in 1989 had NSF money to address the diversity issue, so the politics of this is that SAML wanted some more support from NSF, so NSF said 'do something about diversity'.   In response, they put together an excellent series of workshops.  It seems we reinvent wheels all the time.  If one goes back to that original SAML report, it is clear that the road map for building diversity is there.  The ASLO program brings about 70 minority students (undergraduate and graduate) and mentors to the annual meetings. We have a keynote speaker, a notable person of society help kickoff the pre-conference workshops. The ASLO president usually brings greetings too. We always have a field trip to an aquatic setting, and hold sessions on skill building for the students.  The students are assigned to ""meeting mentors"" who help them navigate the sessions and plan their participation. They have a workbook that they fill out to help in this process, and it includes places to critique talks and posters.  There is a student symposium where the students present work from REUs, or a proposal for the research that they do.  As the students grow they are expected, and do present their work in the regular sessions in subsequent years.   LAST SENTENCE UNCLEAR  There is another program I created called MAST , Minorities At Sea Together.  It's a program that I have run now for two years. I was fortunate enough to get a Pew Fellowship in Marine Conservation, basically for the ASLO work.  And I use this to bring in a dozen minority students from all over the U. S. we sail up to the Chesapeake bay for 3 weeks on a 53 foot ketch.  We do a combination of marine science, marine policy, African American Heritage on the water  (I have now also incorporated  some Native American Heritage as well), and of course sailing.  We spend 3 weeks sailing the entire length of the Chesapeake Bay with stops at all of the major laboratories, museums, governmental agencies, conservation groups, and ports. Three of our hosts belong to NAML, The Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, Horn Point Laboratory, and the Virginia Inst. of Marine Science. All are wonderful hosts.  I have a video made by a student who was a media arts major.    A lot of great points have been made so far.   I want to bring up the issue of graduate school transition.  Back when the original SAML meeting was convened we were really looking hard at getting undergraduates into aquatic sciences.  But since then we have been very successful with programs like those run by Dr. Gilligan, Dr. Vergun, and Dr. Bingham, with of course all the  behind the scenes work done by Dr. Brad Brown.  We see a living example right here with Dr. Dionne Hoskins, who went through Dr. Gilligan's programs as well as the ASLO program.  We are producing a substantial number of students who have environmental or marine backgrounds.   If you turn to page 19 of the article I had in the ASLO bulletin.  If you look at table 2, the percentage of 12th graders scoring below basic proficiency in Math, note for whites it is 21% and for minorities it is 50% and over. So we know right away that when minority students are coming out of High School there are going to be deficiencies in the quantitative sciences and this of course is a bellweather for the sciences in general with quantitative issues.  So programs must be prepared to address that when students come in.   In table  3,  Percentage of total college population, African Americans 11.1 % which is not bad, since the national black population is around 12%.  What happens as we proceed through degrees, when we get down to a very low % of Science and Engineering PhD's, only 2.9 %. For whites, percentages hold strong all the way through the advanced degrees.  So we know the students are going to college. Seven percent of Science and Engineering degrees and B.S. degrees are going to African Americans, that is not all that bad. These students are out there and they are poised to go on to graduate education, but we see it is really not happening in a big way.  And the numbers repeat for Hispanics and Natives Americans as well.    What are we going to do about this?  Well, a lot of the success and if you read Matt's article, on the success of his programs at Savannah State, a lot of it has to do with taking a focused approach.  Also to quote Matt, ""Traditional methods bring traditional results.""  If you keep on doing the same thing, we are going to keep on having the one ""Dionne"" here and there, but no real progress.  So, let's throw the old model out the window. Brad said something important. When students come out, it is not a matter of finding a position available for the student. It is matter of creating a position that matches where the student is.  This flies in the face of the ""meritocracy"" arguments.  If you embrace the meritocracy arguments and you take the California, or Texas position you are saying, ""When people apply we simply continue to take the best,"" expect the same traditional results. The numbers of minorities will stay low. We have got to throw that out. Yes, all students accepted must be capable of completing the program successfully.  But we have to look beyond traditional indicators of success.  Universities are social institutions that need to serve the needs of the society.  They do not serve these needs when they use admission policies that systematically block minority students.  The people that pay the taxes to support the universities include minorities. What we need to do is produce students to serve the entire society.  That means we need to get rid of criteria that try to sort out very fine differences, when what we really want to know is if a student can succeed in a program.  Will they be a good scientist when they are done?  The real question is not whether their GRE's or SAT's were higher than somebody else's, those are irrelevant in trying to produce students, it is can we find a program that can help them meet there full potential?  So you have got to throw out the meritocracy argument, and say, if the student has the ability, (let them in)..  You have got to work with your colleagues on that because it will always be, ""well, he got that because of affirmative action.""  That residue stays there at all times. We have got to get rid of that because diversity is important for the success of any program.  People like to affiliate. When 18-year-olds go to college, the first thing they do is find other people like themselves.  People like to affiliate in groups and distinguish themselves from others.  And that is just true.  So when you go into these marine laboratory centers, what you find is people affiliate, like Dionne said, Microbial groups get together, fish people group together, people don't get invited to parties just because of that.  This is the reality of the situation.    We have to move beyond this tendency to affiliate in exclusionary ways and instead embrace diversity.  Diversity is a good thing for the success of the laboratory and the success of the science.  We all know what happens when there is too much inbreeding in the science. The science does not go anywhere.  This is where diversity will promote the success of the science. The argument for diversity is not based upon social engineering, but rather on the success of the science. When you bring people in with different perspectives then you will help the science grow in different ways.  One thing we really need is to have the same kind of atmosphere available for minority students in graduate school that they find at these undergraduate programs where there is concentration of other minority students.  The University of Maryland, Eastern Shore (an HBCU) is in association with Horn Point Lab. They are starting to build a program.  But their graduate program historically, even though it's a minority serving institution has been mostly white.  They are working hard on changing that. The University of Puerto Rico has done some really great things, and we need to look at linking with them more closely.  What really needs to happen is that  more major institutions need to affiliate with minority serving institutions and create a focused program.  To have a place where minority students will be brought in together for their Ph.D., I'm not talking about Masters degrees, I'm talking about Ph.D.s.   If you look at the article on the next page, table 5, you will see results from a survey completed by the students participating in the ASLO program last February.   I asked them straight out, if you want to go to graduate school, would you prefer to go to a targeted program where there are going to be other minorities students and there will be a program tailored to your success, and where there is going to be cultural competency built in for the faculty as well as for the students.  If you look at the results it is overwhelming yes.  Now this is not a model for every single minority student. There are minority students who have gone through the majority schools and they have made it through and it is going to continue to be that way.  But the minority students are not coming through at a fast enough rate.  It is time for us to try a concentrated model like this.  I think we will have success. This is not my total invention here.  Maryland has a program in Mathematics, which they have done like this, unfortunately they have lost their funding because of the whole meritocracy issue in Maryland.  But once they hit critical mass, African American students go there now because they know they are going to get through the program with an excellent degree and they are going to succeed.   Now what this means is if you represent an institution that is not directly involved in this, you may think well, the minority students, are going to be siphoned off from your potential institution. Well tough, you have got to get out there and compete!  Support this and then you can go out and hire one of these men or woman to come to your program. So I guess maybe a Woods Hole might feel slighted by this sort of program, but they will benefit by being able to hire faculty coming out of this program.    Gilligan:  I offer a couple of examples of collaboration between Savannah State University, an historically- black unit of the University System of Georgia, and  two marine science institutions that have significantly increased minority participation.  The summer of 2002 will be the ninth year of a non-traditional collaborative research experiences for undergraduates program funded by NSF.  It targets what Sue Cook, Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (HBOI), and I thought were some of the key issues in the pathways to science careers among minority students that needed to be addressed.  The term ""pipeline"" has been overused and there is a couple of reasons for not using it: one, pointed out by Judy Gobert at a meeting at NSF, is that does not have positive connotations among Native Americans from Alaska (oil pipelines) and the other is that it implies only one 'correct' path and does not suggest that alternative route choices may exist or be necessary along the way, which is more the reality for folks from underrepresented groups.  Our REU recruits nationally from early undergraduate ranks while they are still deciding on a major and gives them a 'bridging' experience from classroom to research environments by combining lectures, labs and field trips to research institutions for four weeks at SSU to more formal research projects at HBOI for five weeks.   In most REU programs, mentors and researchers want to get students who are farther along - rising seniors who have had all their sciences who are ready to be pre-graduate students.  We take them from an earlier stage of their development with the expectation that they will acquire the skills and confidence enabling them to successfully compete for more typical REU programs which happens at a high rate.  Also it's quite interesting to see the added extras that good experiences at a historically black college can provide for students from large majority institutions no mater their ethnicity.  The other collaborative program that we have is the Collaboration to Integrate Research and Education (CIRE) program with the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO), a non-instructional unit of the University System of Georgia.  Principally because of the close geographic proximity  and complementary missions within the same state system, this project has been remarkably successful. Unprecedented numbers of undergraduates from SSU have participated in research, have become technicians after graduation, and some are applying to the new collaborative M.S. degree in Marine Sciences at SSU.  I think the keys have been equity in terms of effort and commitment on the part of the administrations.  Though principally undergraduate institutions, minority institutions don't deserve to be cast as junior partners in such collaborations such that they are viewed as only able to provide a nurturing environment for undergraduates in the classroom without capacity and desire to be research universities.  Likewise, the majority research institution must be, and probably prefer to be viewed as, more than 'we'll take it from here' research experience provider in their laboratories.  Many minority institutions, and most are small,  have faculty who do research and provide research experiences for students even with limited resources.  That number needs to grow to see more results. I don't think you will find a single small institution, minority or otherwise, that does not want to increase the access and exposure that their undergraduates have to research environments and laboratories. Enhancing the capacity for research at minority institutions and support for education at research labs are important terms in the dynamics of collaboration.  There must be real benefits to the research institution involved because there is a real cost of involving undergraduates in research. These costs are faculty and staff time, supplies, ship/boat time and wear and tear on facilities. Outreach, education and the integration of research and education at both kinds of institutions have real costs.   I think that there may be some misconception regarding the national talent pool.  While the statistics show that minority institutions contribute disproportionally to minority graduates in sciences and that most minority Ph.D.s are earned by those who attended them at some point, there are a lot of minorities at majority serving institutions.  Unfortunately, they may be mismatched to the institution if they have an interest in marine science but find themselves at an institution with appropriate support for their aspirations (curriculum, mentors, REU programs).  I have learned this from the African Americans attending majority institutions who have participated in our summer REU program. Measurable changes in participation and granting of advanced degrees nationally will require that both pools be tapped and that greater demand for access among minorities in general be created by better public information. Since career conceptions are developed early, K-12 information is essential. SAML took the lead in that vein by agreeing to support the development of the 'Bridging the Gap; Minorities in Marine Science' video in 1994.  CD copies of the updated 2000 version have been distributed here. It is available on both CD and VHS tape from SSU.  It hasn't been easy to grow a marine science program at SSU.  Just ask Margaret Robinson who conceived the program at SSU in the late 1970s and Brad Brown who's been there all along the way.  The results of the efforts have been phenomenal, though.  Replicating the long term efforts that went into helping the administration and others understand what kinds of commitments are necessary to grow a programs and collaborations is necessary.  New faculty given the challenge of developing a new programs or emphasis in aquatic sciences may be up against steep odds  - it is important that they be supported.     Follow up Discussion  Cuker:  A person should be designated with the responsibility to make sure that any program really works.  Often programs are adopted, but nobody is brought to task to for whether or not they function and it has not been one of the major parts of responsibility.  Maybe it is added on as something else with everything else that they do.  The point is that in order to make a focus point work, someone really needs to be in charge and see it through.  Our point is that the importance of peer support which is linked to critical mass.  Students have to be brought in with peers, with whom they can connect and learn with.  We learn as much from our near peers as we did from our professors.  You run a program you are not going to bring in a minority student you are going to bring in students.  And the importance of a structure approach.  An example of a class that he had as a graduate student, this is how you put together a talk, this is how you prepare a paper, all those things that in those programs are not necessarily structured in there and are kind of taken for granted.  A lot of people take a focused approach, which is kind of appropriate.    We hear this all the time, changing the award structure for faculty.  It is one thing to encourage to take on minority students and to get that much more involved.  Another thing to do is to recognize a reward system, a rewards system is 70% driven by publications and grants - teaching and other work make up the rest. You can be rotten at the latter two and it really does not matter - we have all sat on these (promotion and tenure) committees.  If we are serious about this, a faculty person may be faced with these.  I am up for tenure in two years.  Do I want to take on a minority student, who may be a perfectly good student on paper but maybe I am not connecting with them because I don't have the cultural similarities.  Or am I going to take on a ""Joe"" who is just like me.  That decision process goes on, and if we are going to expect faculty to try and move out of there own boxes, then we are going to have to structure award systems that has this sort of reward and recognition built in to its institutional values.  In promoting diversity an institution has to be really behind it, not just in name but also in institutional resources.  The institution should be proud of the fact that they are producing minority students and celebrate that rather than just some other box to check off.    Gilligan:  The same may be true to some extent for program managers and proposal reviewers at agencies.  Proposal review criteria concerning the broader impact on society and diversity impact, though touted by agency and division directors, are not always put into practice by reviewers, managers and panels. The conviction to respect these criteria must reach both ways: bottom up from reviewers and top down from officials in order to end up in the critical places where funding recommendations and decisions are made.  Accountability at performance review or promotion/tenure time will get attention and be incorporated into institutional values.  Hoskins:  The conversations that our group focused primarily on, ""If I have a minority student, and I've never worked with an underrepresented minority and there are no other underrepresented minorities in my program, what do I start with what do I do?""  And ""How do we sustain a minority faculty member and how do we deal with the issues and needs that we have with diversity without over taxing that individual?""  The answer to the discussion that came out of the person asking about ""how to help a minority student"". My answer was to get them involved in the community- the community of underrepresented minorities who are in Marine, Environmental Sciences. The easiest way to do that is to get them involved in a program, like Ben's program which is the largest. That program, puts students together and builds an instant community.  Because we are networked, once you get on the list for Ben's program and go to the ASLO program, you are automatically going to be on the list for anything I'm doing, or what Matt is doing or anything that Judith and Brian are doing.  Get a minority student involved in the national community even if there is not a local community. Get them in contact with individuals who have similar concerns or are similar to themselves.  And it makes them feel less intellectually isolated and less culturally isolated, even if they just happen to be culturally isolated where they are.  They get on email and talk to a friend of theirs at VIMS that is having the same issue that they are having, and it also builds a connection and the ability for them to deal with other issues that will evolve as they advance as graduate students:  whether or not to get married and have children in grad school, the concept of graduate student rights and how well they are respected at one graduate institution or at one marine lab versus another.  And all of those are issues were those that I was really able to get a strong perspective on not only around the graduate students that attended my institution but also from students in  that same community that was built out of the ASLO program.  In terms of the sustainability of faculty researchers at a majority lab or institution a conflict exists if you only have one that is your voice of diversity.  And so every single committee, every single council, every single minority student that needs a mentor, you are sending them to that person's office and they are exhausted.  And they can't or they are not always able to say no.    Cuker:  When I first went to Hampton in 1988 the typical student coming in was just like a majority student, they wanted to work with marine mammals. Around the mid 1990's after the publication of Brian's book on environmental racism we had a big switch. We had a lot of students who were coming in motivated about issues of environmental justice and environmental racism. It used to be that environmental concerns where strictly a white middle class thing.  But it has emerged as an opportunity to develop a minority community's sense of environmental ownership.  When presented to student, they say, 'Yeah, I'm living on this toxic coast and my parents have cancer.  This is something that I am interested in studying.'    Brown:  There is still a hangover from the Tuskegee experiment.  If you don't know what that is, you ought to read about it. There is still a very strong feeling within a large part of the African American community when it comes to the mistrust of science, even if it is a Black person doing it.  After all, the people who interacted with the Tuskeegee clients were Black, even though they were not the ones running it the experiment.  I recently met with a mayor of one of Miami Dade county's cities, who was afraid we  "

A student typically chooses which tests to take depending upon  college  entrance requirements for the schools in which he or she is planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as  Achievement Tests , and until January 2005, they were known as  SAT IIs ; they are still commonly known by these names. Every test is now a one-hour timed test. Historically, the exception to the one-hour time was the writing test, which was divided into a 20-minute  essay  question and a 40-minute multiple choice section; it was discontinued after January 2005.   A student may take up to three SAT Subject Tests on any given date. Most SAT subject tests are offered on the same dates as the regular  SAT , except for the March administration. The language tests with listening are generally available only once a year, in November. A calendar of test dates and registration deadlines can be found on  The College Board 's official website ( here ).

[ edit ]   Scoring and admissions   Each individual test is scored on a scale of 200 to 800; however, some of the tests are scored on such generous curves that it is impossible to get a 200; for example, on the Mathematics Level 2 test if someone gets every question wrong, he/she gets a score of about 310 depending on the version of the test. [ 4 ]  The one and only exception was the ELPT, which was scored on a scale of 901 to 999.   Prior to the first administration of the new SAT (which includes the writing section) in March 2005, some highly selective colleges required applicants to take three SAT Subject tests, including the writing test and two other tests of the applicant's choosing, in addition to the SAT. However, with writing now a standard component of the SAT I, most selective colleges recommend applicants to submit scores for any two SAT Subject tests. Engineering schools typically require Chemistry or Physics and prefer Math Level 2. A handful of the most competitive schools, such as  Harvard University  and  Princeton University , [ 5 ]  still require three Subject tests in addition to the three sections of the SAT. It is important to consult the school's website to find out more information about Subject test requirements.   Schools also vary with regard to their SAT Subject test requirements of students submitting scores for the  ACT  in place of the SAT: some schools consider the ACT an alternative to both the SAT and some SAT Subject tests, whereas others accept the ACT but require SAT Subject tests as well. Information about a school's specific test requirements can typically be found on its official website.   The College Board will send all scores on all SAT tests taken, including Subject Tests, whenever a student requests scores be sent to a school; the student cannot select which Subject Tests to send to a given institution.   In October 2002, the College Board decided to drop the ""score choice"" option for exams. They figured that it benefited wealthier students taking the exam who could afford to take it multiple times. Score choice means that scores are not released to colleges until the student approves the score (after seeing it).  [ 6 ]   As of the March 2009 test, test takers now have the ability to choose whether or not to send scores thus reinstating the ""score choice"" option.  [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Answer sheet   The answer sheet has room for 115 answers. 1-100 are Standard Multiple choice questions and 101-115 for 'relationship analysis questions', which are only used for the Chemistry exam. No test has more than 95 questions. The biology test is the only test to use 96-100; questions 1-60 are common to both the E and M tests, in addition, the E uses 61-80, and the M uses 81-100.

MLI Consulting,                    Inc.  is a Management Consulting company that                    specializes in productivity and profit improvement plans                    through enhancing the competency and productivity of corporate                    employees. Our Corporate GMAT prep courses are part of our core                    competency because Management Education is part of the                    competency improvement strategy designed to make key employees                    more proactive and productive in a changing global environment                    characterized by burgeoning free-trade relationships and by                    aggressive global competition. The GMAT and GRE prep classes will be taught by                    MBA graduates who are required to take the GMAT test several times                    in order to stay on top of the changes taking place in the                    GMAT test. Unlike other GMAT prep courses such as the ones offered by  Kaplan, Princeton                    Review, Veritas Prep, or Manhattan Review, our GMAT prep courses will train your employees using the most                    recent GMAT problems, continously updated training materials and study guides so that your                    employees can receive the best coaching in the GMAT assessment areas. All our GMAT prep courses use our patent-pending  CPSD METHODOLOGY   that imparts  C onceptual understanding in all GMAT assessment areas, arms all GMAT prep course participants with time-efficient  P rocedures for maximizing their GMAT test-effectiveness in a time-critical GMAT test environment and 'works-every-time'  S trategies for picking the correct answer to all GMAT problems appearing in the high difficulty mode, and uses a unique 'pull-up-by-the-bootstraps'  D iagnostic tool to determine in real-time each participant's weaknesses in the GMAT test sections so that all participants can receive the best coaching and training in the GMAT assessment areas and so that all participants can  bring confidence and competence to bear on the                    GMAT test-taking process. Because we understand the corporate                    environment best, we can deliver the best training for your                    key employees in regard to GMAT. You cannot find a better                    value for your Corporate Training dollars anywhere else.    All GMAT prep courses include: GMAT-specific                    Concept Review: Personal Weakness                    Diagnostics;                      Extensive hands-on practice and support.                   More VALUE for your              Corporate Dollars. We deliver the most intensive GMAT preparation              ever, and provide consistent support before, during, and after the              GMAT prep class.  Our              GMAT training focuses on skill and competency improvement in the GMAT assessment areas so that your              employees can take the GMAT test, with an enhanced level of confidence              and competency. The other GMAT prep courses run by Kaplan, Princeton Review, Veritas Prep, and Manhattan Review focus on outdated and cheap              tricks, which do not work well in the Adaptive format of the              GMAT.  Because your              key employees are several years removed from a 'high school'              academic environment, and because GMAT tests on skills acquired              during the high-school years, a typical GMAT test-taker is 'rusty as              old ironside' in most of the GMAT-specific skills such as the ones tested              in the Quantitative Assessment. We take nothing for granted and              ensure that your employees will be brought up to speed on all the              GMAT-specific concepts and the nuanced interpretations of different concepts such              as the ratios, factors, probability, geometry, etc.                :                                                                                                   ON-COMPANY-SITE                    GMAT COURSES                     WEEKEND                    GMAT COURSE - 3 DAY INTENSIVE:     The GMAT courses will                    be held at your company meeting room.

I don't believe that I would have done as well without the recommended outline and structure.  Your timing on the Quant section was spot on. Your test-taking strategy (as well as the practice) helped a lot - especially for someone who hasn't sat a formal academic ""test"" in more than 20 years.

I also scored a  5.5 on the AWA section for 87th percentile ranking. Your GMAT prep course was a major factor in my success, and I must thank you for the thorough preparation you offered. I believe that I now have a competitive shot at admission to Columbia Business school.     As you are aware, I took the Veritas Elite GMAT course in Washington D.C. in Oct/Nov. 2005, and I felt that the Veritas Elite  Prep course lacked the necessary tools and methodology that could help me successfully prepare for the GMAT test.  When I first received your pre-class GMAT training files, I realized that your GMAT course was undoubtedly better than that offered by Veritas Elite! Although the majority of the information i had studied did not show up on the test, i felt prepared to deal with any problem that could have been thrown at me.  Veritas only prepared me for the most common problems which could be asked.  I also want to let you know that the incredible detail you pack into each GMAT study and training file allowed me to prepare for each GMAT section in the required depth.  Veritas Prep just put out some stuff out there and forced you to memorize concepts, hoping its crash course would provide enough of the tools necessary to solve most of the problems.   Veritas prep materials also lacked the depth and quality of training that MLIC offered. I strongly recommend MLIC GMAT prep course to anyone serious about getting a score in the 90th percentile range. Thanks again.

Our Turboprep GMAT course participant writes: ""A lawyer admitted to the bar in Munich Germany, I attempted to take the GMAT, knowing that my challenge was in the GMAT Math area. I took a GMAT prep course conducted by a German testpreparation company in Frankfurt and found that the level of teaching involved very simple GMAT problems, even worse than those taught in Kaplan GMAT prep or Princeton Review GMAT classes. After scoring 570 on the GMAT in my first attempt, I researched on the Internet GMAT prep courses and enrolled in the GMAT prep class offered by an American testpreparation Company, MLIC, New York. MLIC GMAT preparation course, besides offering excellent GMAT study and GMAT training materials, also reinforces the learning process with original GMAT questions. The individual attention received from dedicated instructor in the MLIC GMAT class helps one overcome his or her weakness in Mathematics and in Verbal areas of GMAT. Result: I scored 670 on the GMAT.

WHAT IS GMAT® CAT?                  GMAT® , acronym for  G raduate  M anagement  A dmission  T est, is administered by Pearson Vue® on behalf of GMAC® and is required by all  G raduate  S chools of  B usiness for admission purposes.               The GMAT, according to  GMAC                (Graduate Management Admission Council that owns the trademarks GMAT®  and GMAT CAT®, is one measure of your ability to successfully              complete the first year of graduate study program (MBA degree program) at a Graduate School of Business.However, effective January 2006, the paper and pencil version of the GMAT test is no longer offered anywhere in the world. GMATis              administered in a CAT(Computer Adaptive) format in which the GMAT test'adapts' the              difficulty level of GMAT questions to your GMAT-specific 'comfort level', with 'higher              difficulty level GMAT questions' carrying higher GMAT raw scores (GMAT Scaled              Scores) than do 'lower difficulty level' GMAT questions. The              GMAT tests your Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning skills, and your ability (i) to process information in context, (ii) to make necessarily true and probable interpretations of information presented, and (iii) to test different scenarios for consistency of decisions. The test also is about your ability to determine whether GMAT sentences are logically, clearly, correctly, and effectively written.  The GMAT  has three              assessment areas:    AWA  (Analytical Writing Assessment)              that requires you to write Two essays, one analyzing an Issue              and the other analyzing an Argument. This first essay section on the GMAT is not 'adaptive'              and receives a separate score of between 0 and 6.   GMAT Quantitative Assessment  is the first              of the two 'adaptive' sections on the GMAT and follows the Analytical Writing section, and requires that you              answer 37 questions in problem solving and in Data Sufficiency in 75 minutes. Following the GMAT Quantitative section, you will be required to work on the last 'adaptive' section on              the GMAT is  Verbal              Assessment , which requires that you answer 41              questions in 75 minutes. The GMAT Verbal assessment includes three sections: GMAT Critical Reasoning, GMAT Sentence Correction, and GMAT Reading Comprehension. GMAT adaptive sections also include              experimental questions, at least 9 in GMAT Quantitative assessment and 11              in GMAT Verbal assessment. The two adaptive sections on the GMAT receive a combined             score of between 200 and 800. Most A-List Business Schools rated in the top-10 will              require a GMAT test score of at least 650 in order for you to be              competitive. Your best chance for success lies in your ability to              take the GMAT exam at the high difficulty level throughout.

I am happy to report a score of 730 on the test that I took 10 days after the turboprep class in Manhattan.  Your GMAT course is the best for the following reasons:  (1) your study materials are the most thorough I have seen of any prep materials for the GMAT I have worked through; (2) The quality of in-class training was outstanding. The instructor was knowledgeable and patient; and (3) the course had a great structure, with the pre-class training assignments providing the required exposure to the concepts tested on the GMAT. The training materials covered the very basic to the most advanced, and were laid out in easy to follow format.  I have no hesitation in recommending MLIC prep course for the GMAT.           --  Nathaniel Johnson , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, New York City, October 2007--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 11/07 .""   ""I scored a 710 on the GMAT following your turboprep course that I took in New York City during August 2007, a 140 point score improvement over my previous best score of 570. I could not have achieved this significant score increase without your excellent GMAT training and support. Thank you very much.            --  Jamie Crapanzano , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, New York City, August 2007--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 09/07 .""   ""Thank you very much for a great prep course for the GMAT. Before I took your course, I had worked through several books available in book stores to no avail. When I signed up to do your turboprep class, I found what I needed but did not realize: a guided tour of the various assessment areas. The in-class instructor was brilliant, and showed us how the different areas of the GMAT are about the same logical reasoning skills. The drilling in procedural aspects of the Gmat, especially in data sufficiency, and the hit list approach to eliminating answer choices gave me the effective tools I needed to do well on this test. I am happy to report a score of 740 on the Gmat exam which I took 10 days after your class. The score is sufficient to make me competitive at INSEAD. Your prep course works. Cheers.""           --  Matthew Hanwell , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, LONDON, November 2007--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 12/07 .""

All registered participants in our industry-leading, goal-driven, and skill-enhancing GMAT preparatory courses are required to complete at least 120 hours of training in three distinct phases;  PRE-CLASS TRAINING, IN-CLASS TRAINING, AND POST-CLASS TRAINING.    PRE-CLASS GMAT TRAINING   OBJECTIVE OF PRE-COURSE TRAINING  The objective of pre-course training lasting about 50 to 60 hours is to provide a highly structured approach to GMAT training, and to have the registered participants begin to review GMAT-critical concepts and procedures that are critical to taking the GMAT confidently and competently. The pre-course training is also structured to provide remedial training in areas such as algebra, statistics, and sentence correction grammar and idiom rules, and to create a diagnostic baseline for the in-class training. The pre-course training is also meant to help participants unlearn some of the bad habits that they may have picked up from reading useless GMAT prep materials that can be bought in book stores (materials such as those published by Barrons, Arco, GMAT for dummies, to name a few) or obtained from other me-too prep companies (such as Kaplan, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Veritas Prep, Testmasters, 800score.com and others) that have no proven competencies in GMAT training. The pre-course GMAT training is expected to require a commitment of about 50 to 60 hours before you attend the in-class training sessions and provides the required depth of understanding in all the GMAT concepts areas so that you can leverage the in-class training. Remember to register early so that you can receive and complete the required pre-class GMAT training. Participants who attend the in-class sessions after completing the pre-class training to the best of their ability consistently score better than 640 on the GMAT after they complete the in-class and post-class training requirements. MLIC provides  highly structured GMAT preparation, and is unrivalled by any other prep courses offered by companies such as Veritas Prep, Kaplan GMAT, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Manhattan Review, Powerscore, and others.     As soon as you register or about 4-6 weeks before the start of in-class training - whichever is later, you will receive instructions for downloading the required pre-class training files. The files are in PDF format and can be viewed using the ADOBE ACROBAT READER 6.0 or better. MLICETS pre-course training uses  the most relevant and frequently updated study and assignment materials that reflect the changes taking place in the GMAT testing on an on-going basis . The pre-class training can be completed in 50-60 hours and includes mandatory pre-training in the following GMAT assessment areas.   Review of Analytical Writing basics and completion of 5 writing tasks covering GMAT Analysis of an Issue and GMAT Analysis of an Argument.   Review of Sentence Correction Grammar and Idiom rules tested on the GMAT, and completion of a short assignment testing your understanding of the critical rules in Sentence Correction.   Review of Subject-Scope-Qualifier strategy for GMAT Critical Reasoning, and review of Illogical and Logical Arguments; Review of types of questions tested in critical reasoning and the procedures for answering them; Review of Hit List of phrases that will spell trouble in Critical Reasoning answer choices.   Review of Anchor-Phrase Strategy for GMAT Reading Comprehension, and procedures for making Logical interpretation of context-specific information relevant to the question.   Review of Quantitative Concepts in Numbers Theory, Statistics, Algebra, Geometry, and Word problems; Review of Geometry formulas; completion of concept-specific assignments in Numbers Theory, Statistics including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and weighted averages, and algebra.   The pre-class work will be evaluated by your in-class course instructor, who will use your completed work as a baseline for determining what specific additional help may need to be offered to you in order to get you up to speed. The pre-class GMAT training is a critical part of your ability to derive the most benefit out of our in-class GMAT training, and is a requirement for validating your GMAT Score Guarantee. You must attempt to complete all of the required pre-class training assignments to the best of your ability and have your instructor review your work during the in-class training phase. GMAT prep course participants who complete the pre-class training to the best of their ability usually go on to make better than 640 on the GMAT Total score when they take the GMAT exam.

This article's  tone  or style may not be appropriate for Wikipedia . Specific concerns may be found on the  talk page . See Wikipedia's  guide to writing better articles  for suggestions.  (February 2009)       The  SAT Reasoning Test  (formerly  Scholastic Aptitude Test  and  Scholastic Assessment Test ) is a  standardized test  for  college admissions  in the  United States . The SAT is owned, published, and developed by the  College Board , a  non-profit organization  in the United States, and was once developed, published, and scored by the  Educational Testing Service  (ETS). [ 1 ]  ETS now administers the exam.   The current SAT Reasoning Test is administered in about four and one half hours and costs $50 ($71 International), excluding late fees. [ 2 ]  Since the SAT's introduction in 1901, its name and scoring has changed several times. In 2005, the test was renamed as ""SAT Reasoning Test"" with possible scores from 600 to 2400 combining test results from three 800-point sections (math, critical reading, and writing), along with other subsections scored separately.

They state that the SAT assesses how well the test takers analyze and solve problemsskills they learned in school that they will need in college. The SAT is typically taken by  high school   juniors  and  seniors . [ 3 ]  Specifically, the College Board states that use of the SAT in combination with high school grade point average (GPA) provides a better indicator of success in college than high school grades alone, as measured by college freshman  GPA . Various studies conducted over the lifetime of the SAT show a statistically significant increase in  correlation  of high school grades and freshman grades when the SAT is factored in. [ 4 ]   There are substantial differences in funding, curricula, grading, and difficulty among U.S. secondary schools due to American  federalism , local control, and the prevalence of private, distance, and  home schooled  students. SAT (and  ACT ) scores are intended to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local datasuch as course work, grades, and class rankin a national perspective. [ 5 ]   Historically, the SAT has been more popular among colleges in the coasts and the ACT more popular in the Midwest and South. There are some colleges that require the ACT to be taken for college course placement, and a few schools that do not accept the SAT at all.  [ 6 ]   Certain high  IQ  societies, like  Mensa  and the  Triple Nine Society , use scores from certain years as one of their admission tests. For instance, the  Triple Nine Society  accepts scores of 1450 on tests taken before April 1995, and scores of at least 1520 on tests taken between April 1995 and February 2005.     [ edit ]   Structure   SAT consists of three major sections: Critical  Reading ,  Mathematics , and  Writing . Each section receives a score on the scale of 200800. All scores are multiples of 10. Total scores are calculated by adding up scores of the three sections. Each major section is divided into three parts. There are 10 sub-sections, including an additional 25-minute experimental or ""equating"" section that may be in any of the three major sections. The experimental section is used to  normalize  questions for future administrations of the SAT and does not count toward the final score. The test contains 3 hours and 45 minutes of actual timed sections, [ 7 ]  although most administrations, including orientation, distribution of materials, completion of biographical sections, and eleven minutes of timed breaks, run about four and a half hours long.     [ edit ]   Critical Reading   The Critical Reading, formerly verbal, section of the SAT is made up of three scored sections, two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, with varying types of questions, including sentence completions and questions about short and long reading passages. Critical Reading sections normally begin with 5 to 8 sentence completion questions; the remainder of the questions are focused on the reading passages. Sentence completions generally test the student's  vocabulary  and understanding of sentence structure and organization by requiring the student to select one or two words that best complete a given sentence. The bulk of the Critical Reading questions is made up of questions regarding reading passages, in which students read short excerpts on social sciences, humanities, physical sciences, or personal narratives and answer questions based on the passage. Certain sections contain passages asking the student to compare two related passages; generally, these consist of short reading passages as well as longer passages. Since this is a timed test, the number of questions about each passage is proportional to the length of the passage.     [ edit ]   Mathematics   The  Mathematics  section of SAT is widely known as Quantitative Section. Mathematics section consists of three scored sections. There are two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, as follows:     One of the 25-minute sections is entirely multiple choice, with 20 questions.   The other 25-minute section contains 8 multiple choice questions and 10 grid-in questions.   The 20-minute is all multiple choice, with only 16 questions.     Notably, the SAT has done away with quantitative comparison questions on the math section, leaving only questions with straightforward  symbolic  or  numerical  answers. Since the quantitative comparison questions were well-known for their deceptive natureoften turning on the student's recognition of a single exception to a rule or patternthis choice has been equated to a philosophical shift away from ""trickery"" and toward ""straight math"" on the SAT. Also, many test experts have attributed this change, like the addition of the new writing section, to an attempt to make the SAT more like the  ACT . Indeed, there is a correlation between ACT scores and SAT scores. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Writing          Page 1 of an SAT essay. This student received a 7/12 from two judges, one giving 3/6 and the other giving 4/6.              Page 2 of the same essay.       The writing section of the SAT, based on but not directly comparable to the old SAT II subject test in writing, includes multiple choice questions and a brief essay. The essay subscore contributes about 30% towards the total writing score, with the multiple choice questions contributing 70%. This section was implemented in March 2005 following complaints from colleges about the lack of uniform examples of a student's writing ability.   The multiple choice questions include error identification questions, sentence improvement questions, and paragraph improvement questions. Error identification and sentence improvement questions test the student's knowledge of grammar, presenting an awkward or grammatically incorrect sentence; in the error identification section, the student must locate the word producing the source of the error or indicate that the sentence has no error, while the sentence improvement section requires the student to select an acceptable fix to the awkward sentence. The paragraph improvement questions test the student's understanding of logical organization of ideas, presenting a poorly written student essay and asking a series of questions as to what changes might be made to best improve it.   The essay section, which is always administered as the first section of the test, is 25 minutes long. All essays must be in response to a given prompt. The prompts are broad and often philosophical and are designed to be accessible to students regardless of their educational and social backgrounds. For instance, test takers may be asked to expound on such ideas as their opinion on the value of work in human life or whether technological change also carries negative consequences to those who benefit from it. No particular essay structure is required, and the College Board accepts examples ""taken from [the student's] reading, studies, experience, or observations."" Two trained readers assign each essay a score between 1 and 6, where a score of 0 is reserved for essays that are blank, off-topic, non-English, not written with a Number 2 pencil, or considered illegible after several attempts at reading. The scores are summed to produce a final score from 2 to 12 (or 0). If the two readers' scores differ by more than one point, then a senior third reader decides. The average time each reader/grader spends on each essay is less than 3 minutes.  [ 10 ]   Despite the  College Board 's claims that the SAT Essay is a nonbiased assessment of a student's writing ability, many different claims of bias have surfaced, including claims that readers give higher points to those who write in cursive, writers who write about personal experiences are less likely to get higher scores, and that topics favor the higher social classes. [ citation needed ]  The College Board strictly denies any forms of bias on all portions of the SAT Reasoning Exam. In addition, essays with factual errors were not penalized for the errors.   In March 2004 Dr. Les Perelman analyzed 15 scored sample essays contained in the College Board's Score Write book and found that 90% of essays that contained more than 400 words got the highest score of 12 and that the essays with 100 words or fewer got the lowest grade of 1. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Questions   Most of the questions on the SAT are  multiple choice ; all multiple-choice questions have five answer choices, one of which is correct. The questions of each section of the same type are generally ordered by difficulty. However, an important exception exists: Questions that follow the long and short reading passages are organized chronologically, rather than by difficulty. Ten of the questions in one of the math sub-sections are not multiple choice. They instead require the test taker to bubble in a number in a four-column grid.   The questions are weighted equally. For each correct answer, one raw point is added. For each incorrect answer one-fourth of a point is deducted. [ 11 ]  No points are deducted for incorrect math grid-in questions. This ensures that a student's  mathematically expected gain  from guessing is zero. The final score is derived from the raw score; the precise conversion chart varies between test administrations.   The SAT therefore recommends only making educated guesses, that is, when the test taker can eliminate at least one answer he or she thinks is wrong. Without eliminating any answers one's probability of answering correctly is 20%. Eliminating one wrong answer increases this probability to 25%; two, a 33.3% probability; three, a 50% probability of choosing the correct answer and thus earning the full point for the question.

The test is typically offered on the first Saturday of the month for the November, December, May, and June administrations. In other countries, the SAT is offered on the same dates as in the  United States  except for the first spring test date (i.e., March or April), which is not offered. In 2006, the test was taken 1,465,744 times. [ 12 ]   Candidates may either take the SAT Reasoning Test or up to three  SAT Subject Tests  on any given test date, except the first spring test date, when only the SAT Reasoning Test is offered. Candidates wishing to take the test may register online at the College Board's website, by mail, or by telephone, at least three weeks before the test date.   The SAT Subject Tests are all given in one large book on test day. Therefore, it is actually immaterial which tests, and how many, the student signs up for; with the possible exception of the language tests with listening, the student may change his or her mind and take  any  tests, regardless of his or her initial sign-ups. Students who choose to take more subject tests than they signed up for will later be billed by College Board for the additional tests and their scores will be withheld until the bill is paid. Students who choose to take fewer subject tests than they signed up for are not eligible for a refund.   The SAT Reasoning Test costs $45 ($71 International). For the Subject tests, students pay a $20 Basic Registration Fee and $9 per test (except for language tests with listening, which cost $20 each). [ 2 ]  The College Board makes fee waivers available for low income students. Additional fees apply for late registration, standby testing, registration changes, scores by telephone, and extra score reports (beyond the four provided for free).   Candidates whose religious beliefs prevent them from taking the test on a Saturday may request to take the test on the following Sunday, except for the October test date in which the Sunday test date is eight days after the main test offering. Such requests must be made at the time of registration and are subject to denial.   Students with verifiable disabilities, including physical and learning disabilities, are eligible to take the SAT with accommodations. The standard time increase for students requiring additional time due to learning disabilities is 50%.     [ edit ]   Raw scores, scaled scores, and percentiles   Students receive their online score reports approximately three weeks after test administration (six weeks for mailed, paper scores), with each section graded on a scale of 200800 and two sub scores for the writing section: the essay score and the multiple choice sub score. In addition to their score, students receive their  percentile  (the percentage of other test takers with lower scores). The raw score, or the number of points gained from correct answers and lost from incorrect answers (ranges from just under 50 to just under 60, depending upon the test), is also included. [ 13 ]  Students may also receive, for an additional fee, the Question and Answer Service, which provides the student's answer, the correct answer to each question, and online resources explaining each question.   The corresponding percentile of each scaled score varies from test to testfor example, in 2003, a scaled score of 800 in both sections of the SAT Reasoning Test corresponded to a percentile of 99.9, while a scaled score of 800 in the SAT Physics Test corresponded to the 94th percentile. The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are because of the content of the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to intensive study (often in the form of an  AP , which is relatively more difficult), and only those who know they will perform well tend to take these tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores.   The percentiles that various SAT scores for college-bound seniors correspond to are summarized in the following chart: [ 14 ] [ 12 ]       Percentile   Score, 1600 Scale  (official, 2006)   Score, 2400 Scale  (official, 2006)       99.93/99.98*   1600   2400       99+   1540   2290       99   1480   2200       98   1450   2140       97   1420   2100       88   1380   1900       83   1280   1800       78   1200   1770       72   1150   1700       61   1090   1600       48   1010   1500       36   950   1400       15   810   1200       4   670   1010       1   520   790       * The percentile of the perfect score was 99.98 on the 2400 scale and 99.93 on the 1600 scale.       The older SAT (before 1995) had a very high ceiling. In any given year, only seven of the million test-takers scored above 1580. A score above 1580 was equivalent to the 99.9995 percentile.

States in orange had more students taking the SAT than the  ACT .       Although there is no official conversion chart between the SAT and its biggest rival, the  ACT , the College Board released an unofficial chart based on results from 103,525 test takers who took both tests between October 1994 and December 1996  here ; however, both tests have changed since then. Several colleges have also issued their own charts. The following is based on the University of California's conversion chart.

[ edit ]   1901 test   The College Board began on June 17, 1901, when 973 students took its first test, across 67 locations in the United States, and two in Europe. Although those taking the test came from a variety of backgrounds, approximately one third were from  New York ,  New Jersey , or  Pennsylvania . The majority of those taking the test were from private schools, academies, or endowed schools. About 60% of those taking the test applied to  Columbia University . The test contained sections on English,  French ,  German ,  Latin ,  Greek , history, mathematics,  chemistry , and  physics . The test was not multiple choice, but instead was evaluated based on essay responses as ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""doubtful,"" ""poor,"" or ""very poor.""  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   1926 test   The first administration of the SAT occurred on June 23, 1926, when it was known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of  definitions ,  arithmetic , classification, artificial language,  antonyms , number series,  analogies ,  logical inference , and paragraph reading. It was administered to over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to  Yale University  and  Smith College  respectively.  [ 20 ]  The test was paced rather quickly, test-takers being given only a little over 90 minutes to answer 315 questions. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1928 and 1929 tests   In 1928 the number of verbal sections was reduced to 7, and the time limit was increased to slightly under two hours. In 1929 the number of sections was again reduced, this time to 6. These changes in part loosened time constraints on test-takers. Math was eliminated entirely for these tests, instead focusing only on verbal ability. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1930 test and 1936 changes   In 1930 the SAT was first split into the verbal and math sections, a structure that would continue through 2004. The verbal section of the 1930 test covered a more narrow range on content than its predecessors, examining only antonyms, double definitions (somewhat similar to sentence completions), and paragraph reading. In 1936, analogies were re-added. Between 1936 and 1946, students had between 80 and 115 minutes to answer 250 verbal questions (over a third of which were on antonyms). The mathematics test introduced in 1930 contained 100 free response questions to be answered in 80 minutes, and focused primarily on speed. From 1936 to 1941, like the 1928 and 1929 tests, the mathematics section was eliminated entirely. When the mathematics portion of the test was re-added in 1942, it consisted of multiple choice questions. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1946 test and associated changes   Paragraph reading was eliminated from the verbal portion of the SAT in 1946, and replaced with reading comprehension, and ""double definition"" questions were replaced with sentence completions. Between 1946 and 1957 students were given 90 to 100 minutes to complete 107 to 170 verbal questions. Starting in 1958 time limits became more stable, and for 17 years, until 1975, students had 75 minutes to answer 90 questions. In 1959 questions on data sufficiency were introduced to the mathematics section, and then replaced with quantitative comparisons in 1974. In 1974 both verbal and math sections were reduced from 75 minutes to 60 minutes each, with changes in test composition compensating for the decreased time. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1980 test and associated changes   The inclusion of the ""Strivers"" Score study was implemented. This study was introduced by The Educational Testing Service, which administers the SAT, and has been conducting research on how to make it easier for minorities and individuals who suffer from social and economic barriers. The original ""Strivers"" project, which was in the research phase from 19801994, awarded special ""Striver"" status to test-takers who scored 200 points higher than expected for their race, gender and income level. The belief was that this would give minorities a better chance at being accepted in to a college of higher standard, i.e. an Ivy League school. In 1992, the Strivers Project was leaked to the public; as a result the Strivers Project was terminated in 1993. After Federal Courts heard arguments from the ACLU, NAACP and the Educational Testing Service, the courts ordered the study to alter its data collection process, stating that only the age, race and zip code could be used to determine the test-takers eligibility for ""Strivers"" points. These changes were introduced to the SAT effective in 1994.     [ edit ]   1994 changes   In 1994 the verbal section received a dramatic change in focus. Among these changes were the removal of  antonym  questions, and an increased focus on passage reading. The mathematics section also saw a dramatic change in 1994, thanks in part to pressure from the  National Council of Teachers of Mathematics . For the first time since 1935, the SAT asked some non-multiple choice questions, instead requiring students to supply the answers. 1994 also saw the introduction of calculators into the mathematics section for the first time in the test's history. The mathematics section introduced concepts of probability, slope, elementary statistics, counting problems, median and mode. [ 19 ]   The average score on the 1994 modification of the SAT I was usually around 1000 (500 on the verbal, 500 on the math). The most selective schools in the United States (for example, those in the  Ivy League ) typically had SAT averages exceeding 1400 on the old test.     [ edit ]   2002 changes - Score Choice   In October 2002, the College Board dropped the Score Choice Option. Under this option, scores were not released to colleges until the student saw and approved of the score. [ 21 ]  The reasoning was that the option benefited wealthier students who could afford to take it multiple times. The College Board has since decided to re-implement Score Choice in the spring of 2009. It is described as optional, and it is not clear if the reports sent will indicate whether or not this student has opted-in or not. A number of highly selective colleges and universities have announced they will require applicants to submit all scores, including  Harvard ,  Cornell ,  Yale  and  Stanford . Others, such as  MIT , have embraced Score Choice.     [ edit ]   2005 changes   In 2005, the test was changed again, largely in response to criticism by the  University of California system . [ 22 ]  Because of issues concerning ambiguous questions, especially  analogies , certain types of questions were eliminated (the analogies from the verbal and quantitative comparisons from the Math section). The test was made marginally harder, as a corrective to the rising number of perfect scores. A new writing section, with an essay, based on the former SAT II Writing Subject Test, was added, in part to increase the chances of closing the opening gap between the highest and midrange scores. Other factors included the desire to test the writing ability of each student in a personal manner; hence the essay. The New SAT (known as the SAT Reasoning Test) was first offered on March 12, 2005, after the last administration of the ""old"" SAT in January 2005. The Mathematics section was expanded to cover three years of high school mathematics. The Verbal section's name was changed to the Critical Reading section.     [ edit ]   2008 changes   In 2008, or rather for the late 2008, 2009 testing, a new variable came into play. Before, it was required for applicants to most colleges to submit all scores with some colleges who embraced Score Choice to allow their students to do so. However, this year, an initiative to make Score Choice universal began, with some opposition from colleges desiring to maintain score report practices. While students theoretically now have the choice to submit their best score (in theory one could send any score they wish to send) to the college of their choice, some popular colleges and universities, such as Cornell, ask that students send all test scores. [ 23 ]  This had led the College Board to display on their web site which colleges agree with or dislike Score Choice, with continued claims that students will still never have scores submitted against their will.     [ edit ]   Name changes and recentered scores   Although originally standing for ""Scholastic Aptitude Test"" [ 24 ] , in 1990, because of uncertainty about the SAT's ability to function as an  intelligence test , the name was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test. In 1993 the name was changed to SAT I: Reasoning Test (with the  letters not standing for anything ) to distinguish it from the  SAT II: Subject Tests [ 24 ] . In 2004, the roman numerals on both tests were dropped, and the SAT I renamed the SAT Reasoning Test [ 24 ] . The scoring categories are now the following: Critical Reading (comparable to some of the Verbal portions of the old SAT I), Mathematics, and Writing. The writing section now includes an essay, whose score is involved in computing the overall score for the Writing section, as well as grammar sections (also comparable to some Verbal portions of the previous SAT).   The test scoring was initially scaled to make 500 the mean score on each section with a  standard deviation  of 100. [ 25 ]  As the test grew more popular and more students from less rigorous schools began taking the test, the average dropped to about 428 Verbal and 478 Math. The SAT was ""recentered"" in 1995, and the average ""new"" score became again close to 500. Scores awarded after 1994 and before October 2001 are officially reported with an ""R"" (e.g. 1260R) to reflect this change. Old scores may be recentered to compare to 1995 to present scores by using official College Board tables [ 26 ]  , which in the middle ranges add about 70 points to Verbal and 20 or 30 points to Math. In other words, current students have a 100 (70 plus 30) point advantage over their parents.     [ edit ]   Controversy     [ edit ]   Scoring problems of October 2005 tests   In March 2006, it was announced that a small percentage of the SATs taken in October 2005 had been scored incorrectly due to the test papers being moist and not scanning properly, and that some students had received substantially erroneous scores. The College Board announced they would change the scores for the students who were given a lower score than they earned, but at this point many of those students had already applied to colleges using their original scores. The College Board decided not to change the scores for the students who were given a higher score than they earned. A lawsuit was filed in 2005 by about 4,400 students who received an incorrect low score on the SAT. The class-action suit was settled in August 2007 when The College Board and another company that administers the college-admissions test announced they would pay $2.85 million to over 4,000 students. Under the agreement each student can either elect to receive $275 or submit a claim for more money if he or she feels the damage was even greater. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Criticism     [ edit ]   Bias                        As depicted above, SAT scores vary according to race, income, and parental educational background.       A famous example of alleged bias in the SAT I was the  oarsman - regatta  analogy question. [ 28 ]  The object of the question was to find the pair of terms that have the relationship most similar to the relationship between ""runner"" and ""marathon."" The correct answer was ""oarsman"" and ""regatta."" Choice of the correct answer presupposed students' familiarity with a sport popular with the wealthy, and so upon their knowledge of its structure and terminology. Fifty-three percent (53%) of white students - who in greater numbers come from higher income households - correctly answered the question, while only 22% of black students - who disproportionately came from lower income households - also scored correctly. [ 29 ]  Analogy questions have since been replaced by short reading passages.     [ edit ]   Dropping SAT   A growing number of  liberal arts colleges  have responded to this criticism by joining the  SAT optional movement . These colleges do not require the SAT for admission.   In a 2001 speech to the  American Council on Education ,  Richard C. Atkinson , then president of the  University of California , urged dropping the SAT Reasoning Test as a college admissions requirement:     ""Anyone involved in education should be concerned about how overemphasis on the SAT is distorting educational priorities and practices, how the test is perceived by many as unfair, and how it can have a devastating impact on the self-esteem and aspirations of young students. There is widespread agreement that overemphasis on the SAT harms American education."" [ 30 ]     In response to threats by the University of California to drop the SAT as an admission requirement, the College Entrance Examination Board announced the restructuring of the SAT, to take effect in March 2005, as detailed above.     [ edit ]   Essay   In 2005,  MIT  Writing Director  Les Perelman  plotted essay length versus essay score on the new SAT from released essays and found a high correlation between them. After studying 23 graded essays he found that the longer the essay was the higher the score. He also discovered that several of these essays were full of factual errors. However, the official SAT guide for scorers state that the essays should be scored according to their quality of writing and not factual accuracy. The National Council of Teachers of English also criticize the 25-minute writing section of the test, arguing that the basic principles of writing encourage the revision of written material several times. They say that the amount of time allowed for the test pushes schools to develop a formulaic system of writing. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Test preparation   Many companies and organizations offer test preparation in the form of books, classes, online courses, tutoring and only recently, board games [ 32 ] . Large organizations include  Kaplan  and  the Princeton Review . Some have criticized the SAT because preparation often can lead to much higher scores, but some have embraced the opportunity to improve their scores.

A student typically chooses which tests to take depending upon  college  entrance requirements for the schools in which he or she is planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as  Achievement Tests , and until January 2005, they were known as  SAT IIs ; they are still commonly known by these names. Every test is now a one-hour timed test. Historically, the exception to the one-hour time was the writing test, which was divided into a 20-minute  essay  question and a 40-minute multiple choice section; it was discontinued after January 2005.   A student may take up to three SAT Subject Tests on any given date. Most SAT subject tests are offered on the same dates as the regular  SAT , except for the March administration. The language tests with listening are generally available only once a year, in November. A calendar of test dates and registration deadlines can be found on  The College Board 's official website ( here ).

[ edit ]   Scoring and admissions   Each individual test is scored on a scale of 200 to 800; however, some of the tests are scored on such generous curves that it is impossible to get a 200; for example, on the Mathematics Level 2 test if someone gets every question wrong, he/she gets a score of about 310 depending on the version of the test. [ 4 ]  The one and only exception was the ELPT, which was scored on a scale of 901 to 999.   Prior to the first administration of the new SAT (which includes the writing section) in March 2005, some highly selective colleges required applicants to take three SAT Subject tests, including the writing test and two other tests of the applicant's choosing, in addition to the SAT. However, with writing now a standard component of the SAT I, most selective colleges recommend applicants to submit scores for any two SAT Subject tests. Engineering schools typically require Chemistry or Physics and prefer Math Level 2. A handful of the most competitive schools, such as  Harvard University  and  Princeton University , [ 5 ]  still require three Subject tests in addition to the three sections of the SAT. It is important to consult the school's website to find out more information about Subject test requirements.   Schools also vary with regard to their SAT Subject test requirements of students submitting scores for the  ACT  in place of the SAT: some schools consider the ACT an alternative to both the SAT and some SAT Subject tests, whereas others accept the ACT but require SAT Subject tests as well. Information about a school's specific test requirements can typically be found on its official website.   The College Board will send all scores on all SAT tests taken, including Subject Tests, whenever a student requests scores be sent to a school; the student cannot select which Subject Tests to send to a given institution.   In October 2002, the College Board decided to drop the ""score choice"" option for exams. They figured that it benefited wealthier students taking the exam who could afford to take it multiple times. Score choice means that scores are not released to colleges until the student approves the score (after seeing it).  [ 6 ]   As of the March 2009 test, test takers now have the ability to choose whether or not to send scores thus reinstating the ""score choice"" option.  [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Answer sheet   The answer sheet has room for 115 answers. 1-100 are Standard Multiple choice questions and 101-115 for 'relationship analysis questions', which are only used for the Chemistry exam. No test has more than 95 questions. The biology test is the only test to use 96-100; questions 1-60 are common to both the E and M tests, in addition, the E uses 61-80, and the M uses 81-100.

clueweb09-en0008-48-26488	"Diversity Panel NAML Fall 2001 Meeting Hatfield Marine Science Center, Newport, OR Oct. 4-6, 2001   Foreword   The Southern Association of Marine Labs (SAML) has maintained a keen interest and involvement in increasing diversity in marine science careers, in general, and at marine labs, in particular since its founding in 1985.  During the late 1980's SAML received an NSF grant to determine possible ways of increasing diversity, and during the 1990's produced two videos for encouraging minority participation in marine sciences.  Drs. Matt Gilligan and Sue Cook of Savannah State University and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, respectively, led in the production and distribution of these videos.   When National Association of Marine Laboratories (NAML) President, Dr. Lavern Weber (2000-2001), expressed that one of his goals during his presidency would be to focus on marine education, I thought as SAML President (2000-2001), that we should share our SAML diversity expertise at the NAML Biennial Mtg.  After SAML Board of Directors and Membership discussions, Matt Gilligan, SAML Education Committee Chair, accepted the challenge.  He subsequently formed a blue-ribbon panel of diversity experts for the meeting at the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, Oregon, 4-6 October 2001.  The panel presentation was entitled ""Marine Education Diversity, Retention, and Recruitment"", and panelists included:  Dr. Benjamin Cuker, Hampton University; Dr. Judith Vergun, Oregon State University; Dr. Brian Bingham, Western Washington University; Dr. Dionne Hoskins, NMFS, NOAA, Savannah State University; and, Dr. Brad Brown, NMFS, NOAA, Miami, Florida.  SAML funded the travel for these five national diversity leaders to the Oregon meeting.   On behalf of SAML and NAML, I gratefully acknowledge and thank Dr. Matt Gilligan and all five panelists for their participation and documentation of this significant issue.   Wes Tunnell        SAML President        (2000-2001)    Transcript  Gilligan:  Thanks, Wes.  I'm happy to be here to moderate this panel discussion on strategies to increase minority participation at marine laboratories and in marine sciences.  We have an hour this morning and we will have a half hour after lunch for the session.  It is our hope that perhaps the presentations this morning can be used to help focus discussion groups, chaired by panelists during lunch.  Since we won't have a lot of time for much discussion this morning, I ask you to save questions until lunch or the afternoon session. The panelists will summarize the lunchtime discussions during the session after lunch.  The proceedings are being taped and we hope to turn it into a report for the membership. What you have in the handout are literature and other resources that this panel has helped put together.  It includes the SAML video on CD ROM entitled ""Bridging the Gap: Minorities in Marine Science"". It was a very popular item at a National Marine Education Association meeting and is distributed directly to teachers and others, especially to places that do not have staff in Marine Science, Ocean Science, or Natural Science areas by Savannah State University. It includes Ben Cuker's recent article in the ASLO bulletin ""Steps to increase minority participation in aquatic Sciences"", and a 1996 article by me, ""Promoting Diversity in Fisheries Profession"".  Also included are highlights from the most recent Expanding Opportunities Conference at Jackson State University coordinated by Ambrose Gerald.  Reports from all of the annual conferences can be obtained through him, at the NOAA Fisheries Northeast Science Center in Woods Hole. Finally, two emails are included: one from Sue Weiler who has put together a Minorities in Aquatic Science (MAS) database and web page at the ASLO website and one from Kelly Clark, at Morgan State University who is putting together a website on minorities in marine and environmental sciences.   Our distinguished panelists today include from right to left, Dr. Benjamin Cuker, Hampton University; Dr. Brian Bingham, Western Washington University; Dr. Bradford Brown, NOAA Fisheries and President of the Miami-Dade chapter of the NAACP; Dr. Judith Vergun, Oregon State University; and Dr. Dionne Hoskins, NOAA Fisheries, Galveston and Savannah State University. With that very brief introduction, I now ask each of the panelists to address the issue from their perspectives responding, specifically, to some of the questions that are on in the handout.  Brown:  I am with NOAA Fisheries Service and currently serve as the Senior Advisor to the Director of National Marine Fishery Service and this includes a series of areas of special responsibility, one of them being the Fisheries Service's responsibilities in NOAA's Minority Serving Institution Initiative.  Prior to that I served for over a decade as the Director of South East Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fishery Service which is the equivalent of the North West Center which has a unit here in Newport.  Prior to that, I was the Deputy Director and before that I spent most of my career in the National Marine Fisheries Laboratory in Woods Hole where I dealt with stock assessment issues.  I also spent 5 years as assistant professor of Zoology and Assistant Leader of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Cooperative Fisheries Unit at Oklahoma State University.  And in all of that time, I have been involved in efforts to increase diversity in fisheries.   I would like to let you know some of the background of today's efforts and also some of the things that have not changed.  As far as I know, the very first African American summer hire at a Federal marine fisheries lab was in 1962. He came the same year I started with the then Bureau of Commercial Fisheries.  In those days, summer hires in Federal Laboratories were political referrals. This referral came from the newly elected President John F. Kennedy who had an interest in the marine area.  As you may remember he watched his inaugural parade and saw an all white Coast Guard Unit, as a result, he made sure he got folks into the Coast Guard Academy.  He also saw that we had a summer hire at the Federal Marine Fisheries Laboratory in Woods Hole, a student from a very distinguished family, graduated from a private school and heading on to Harvard.  The interesting thing, and I think often it is still true, the only person he visited with outside of the laboratory, in that entire summer was me.  He had a lot more money than I did right out of graduate school.  I was still with my orange crate furniture and bookcases, but never the less I was the only one in that entire laboratory that reached out.  The opportunity to have to gotten him interested in going on into marine science was basically lost because of that.    I want to jump ahead a little bit; this is not the first panel I have been on regarding this subject.  That was at the American Fisheries Society in 1981, and again at the Oceans 82 conference.  I just want to read what I wrote in the Marine Technology Journal in 1983 (Hannaham, 1983), following that conference.  ""The fundamental principle regarding the role of minorities in marine affairs is the observation that while a number of minorities, Black Americans in particular, have had a long history of involvement in the maritime and marine sectors of the economy of the United States being represented in the merchant marine, on the docks, whaling vessels, in fish processing plants, etc., they have only miniscule representation in those areas in the marine sectors that involve professional and scientific management and marine policy.  It is axiomatic that the lack of involvement at the latter levels of the economy have both robbed the United States of an important segment of potential talent needed to address critical problems but it also sets the stage for decisions to be made that may directly or more insidiously indirectly adversely affect those components of society not represented at the table.  Historically, minorities have not been welcomed in marine professions, or at many of the institutions which train people for these professions.  Furthermore this history creates a vicious cycle that perpetuates itself both by ensuring that the incoming generation is made ignorant of the opportunities available in marine areas.  This lack of role models can become critical"".  I dare say this is not outdated, even though it is 20 years old.   I just want to give a little more history.  Not so long ago, I took a look at the Class of 1958 year book from Burke High School in Charleston, South Carolina, the historic Black High School.  The Valedictorian and the Salutatorian, both were listed as wanting to be scientists, both of them ended up being high school science teachers.  When they graduated from South Carolina State University (SCSU) in the early 60's, they were never informed that the only requirement for getting a job with the Federal Government as a biologist was to fill out a form and send in your transcript.  And in those days we had a shortage of fishery biologists!  We were grabbing people to come into the field who had general biology backgrounds.  With a fisheries background and a master's degree, I got written job offers from maybe 10 laboratories spread throughout the country. Many others who were hired didn't have a fisheries background.  All the SCSU students were told was that they could take the Federal Services Entrance Exam and go into Administration probably in D.C.  So we deliberately kept people out at a time when it would have been so easy to bring persons into the system.    If we look at current imperatives, I think we need to be sure that we are honestly aware of the population demographics changing in this country. It is true in our professions we have a long lag time, as we are not hiring persons right out of high school.  Thus the time the population changes impact people getting PhD's is a long time after the shifts we see in the public school system, but never the less, it is coming.  We already are seeing it, in the changes in Congress and State Legislatures.    I would like to tell another story of the first African American woman who was hired by Fisheries to go to sea in Miami.  As soon as she was hired, she was taken aboard an old vessel, shown a common living space with an open shower and told if she did not like it, she ought to quit right then.  When she complained about this treatment it was suggested that she take a non-sea going job.  When she was sent to her location assignment, her new supervisor suggested that the job was boring and they were never able to keep scientists at it, but if he was ordered to take her he would.  So that is the history that we come from not too many years ago.    We are seeing changes of course, particularly in the political structure.  I see it very clearly in some of the efforts that I am involved in South Florida's ecosystem restoration in which we are planning to spend 8 billion dollars to ""Restore the Everglades Ecosystem"".   The local people have to vote for it.  We have had a system that has been driven primarily by white environmentalists often opposed by agriculture, developers and the power and water supply folks, etc., and yet you have virtually no representation of our large African American and Hispanic groups in this process and one questions how successfully will support for restoration be maintained unless we make a major effort towards inclusion. Those who are looking for legislators and for others to be sympathetic towards ecological concerns and receiving their political support need to break through the diversity barrier for success.   In a presentation made to the American Fishery Society back in 1992 right after the release of the 1990 Census, Essie Duffie and I said that anyone who looks at candidates running in this years election realizes that we are living in a era where women are seeking office in impressive numbers and that the recent redistricting greatly increases the representation of African American and Hispanics in the legislatures.   How are fisheries agencies going to fare? How are natural resources going to fare, especially if our presentations to elected officials are made by mostly white males?   Today we have made a break through to a significant degree where we at least can send white females out from many Federal agencies.  But we still send all white delegations.  Well we have got to change some of our strategies, we have got to get people on our staff or our issues will be in peril if we don't.    The cardinal thing that we have to do is realize that (I am speaking specifically about African Americans now,) potential employees are available.  This is different from what the situation was not too many years ago, thanks to the work of people like Dr. Gilligan and Dr. Cuker.  But there are not enough available to saturate the market so that in order to make breakthroughs you have to essentially find a position for a person rather than a person for the position.  If we wait until we advertise for the position, the chances are, we will not find anybody on the application list.  What I mean by the first is that if I ask somebody in one of our laboratories, say Galveston, to list what new staff they need, they would come up with probably at least a 50% increase in their scientific staff that they absolutely have to have to be able to meet the demands that are placed on them by the fishery managers.  However they have limited funds so they are filling only one position.  If you were to say that if we find an African American, or a Hispanic, who can make a significant contribution in one of those other positions that are further down the list of priorities but are still needed in the system, and hired them, we could dramatically increase the representation in the work force.  It does not take much to dramatically increase it. If one brings in new people who can reach out and involve other people previously left out, there is a cascading effect.    There is also the availability of African and Caribbean marine scientists coming to our institutions particularly at the graduate student level.  I have talked in Africa to people who are fascinated by, and have great interest in Black America yet when they come here they never see anybody because they are completely isolated.  You have got to be able to find, and make the opportunities so those links can be made. There are many individuals who would be grateful for that link to individuals in the Black communities of this country.    Finally I want to say that we have got to take advantage of the NOAA Minority Serving Institute (MSI) Initiative.  NOAA has just released funding for Science Centers, 2.5 million each. The plan is that if the money is renewed in Congress it will go for 3 years and probably be renewed for another 3 years at the same schools.  These are in Atmospheric, Remote Sensing, Marine Environment and Living Marine Resources.  The schools that are involved in the in the last two are Hampton, Savannah, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Delaware State, Jackson State, Morgan State, South Carolina State and Florida A&M Universities.  They are basically the schools that had taken a step forward in this area, and now they are getting a significant infusion of funds.  One can piggyback those activities.  NOAA also has an Environmental Entrepreneurship Program which is giving $300,000 grants each, to about 12 schools.  This is an annual program and provides another opportunity for linkages.  One of the places to look for a model of success is the National Council for Minorities in Engineering, (NACME).  I will end with a conclusion from one of NACME's studies giving the requisites for progress. ""Strong institutional commitment as evidenced by attitudes of faculty and staff, integral minority engineering programs and allocation of resources"".  This further points out that you need support at the top but you have got to avoid the sabotage down below.  Efforts all along these lines are needed for science to diversify.  Bingham:   I am here because of my connection with the Minorities in Marine Science Undergraduate Program (MIMSUP) administered through the Shannon Point Marine Center.  The program was started in 1991 by Dr. Steve Sulkin. He can provide advice on how a marine center can get such a program launched.  In the short time I have, I would like to tell you about our program and some of the lessons we have learned over the past 11 years.  MIMSUP is unique for a couple of reason.  First, it is an academic year program rather than a summer internship.  We recruit students out of their home institutions and invite them to come to Washington State for 5 months.  This can raise difficulties because students are generally in an academic track working through predetermined course sequences.  They have to be willing and able to jump out of those tracks for two quarters.  The second unusual feature of MIMSUP is that we are running a program for underrepresented groups in an area that doesn't have a large resident minority population to draw from. We have to attract students from other institutions and have faced the recruiting challenges shared by many people working with underrepresented students.  Some believe that there are simply not enough qualified people to fill the positions. We have faced some significant challenges, but have seen great success with our students. I would like to share some ideas with you, focusing on what has worked, and not worked, for us.  MIMSUP is 2 full quarters long, running from January to June. In the first quarter we work to accomplish four things:  1. We give the students coursework in basic marine science.  This is accomplished through a focused oceanography course that includes lecture and lab with an active experiential field component.  2. We work on remediation with participants who may not be completely prepared for our courses. We focus on math and writing, using a tutorial approach, to get them up to speed. They need to be prepared to successfully step into senior-level courses during the second quarter.    3. We work with them to build up their resumes/CVs. When students leave MIMSUP, they have things on their CV that make them competitive for REU programs or graduate school. As part of the CV building, the students complete an independent research project that is structured as a mini-graduate experience. The process includes interviewing potential advisors, developing a research proposal and carrying out a project.  4. We give them a realistic view of what marine science really is and what job opportunities are available. We take them to potential employers in all sectors including government, academia, private consulting, non-governmental organizations and aquaria. Over the years, we have developed a group of supportive individuals who will sit down and frankly tell the students what is good about the job, what is bad, what the salaries and benefits are, how they prepared for their positions and what they wish they had done differently.  When we are done, the students have a good overview of the possible places they can go with a marine science degree.  This all happens in the first quarter. It is an extremely focused and time-consuming effort on the part of the faculty and staff of the marine center.  To be successful, a program like this has to be a priority for everyone. It helps enormously to have many people involved and contributing. With that kind of support network, you can accomplish great things with the students.    In the second quarter, the students take specialty courses with other students from the general Western Washington University student body; they are thus incorporated into a larger community.  They also take a course where we teach them scientific communication skills, focusing on writing and speaking. We built the course around the research the MIMSUP students completed in the first quarter.  When we have finished, the students have written up their research as a manuscript article, they have created and presented their work as a scientific poster and they have given a research talk in a mini-symposium. The culmination of their scientific communication training is a trip to a regional or national scientific meeting where they again present their posters and talks. This is an extremely important experience that demonstrates to them that they can participate in broad scientific arenas.  At the same time, it is an important CV-building exercise.    That is a brief overview of what we do.  I would raise a few helpful points we have learned. First, a small lab with no resident minority population can make a difference.  It does not necessarily require a close connection with a minority institution or with a majority institution housing a large population of underrepresented students.  All it really takes is a commitment on the part of individuals to spend serious time working with students. The outcomes can be outstanding. We are seeing many of our program alumni going into graduate programs in the marine and environmental sciences.  I believe MIMSUP is making a difference.  Second, any program of this type is going to have enormous challenges.  For example, student participants may have very different backgrounds and levels of preparation. Some, on paper, don't look very good and would not be competitive for jobs or graduate programs.  Yet we find, when we work to understand the student's background and weaknesses, we can really take them places.  Finding these promising students may require rethinking how we evaluate applications.  Applicants for whom we can do the most good are not likely to be the 3.8 students with extensive marine experience. Instead he/she may be a 2.8 student who has never been out of southern Texas. In many cases, the students have simply never been in the right situation to realize their potential.  When you bring them in, work with them and give them opportunities, you see amazing things happen.    Strengthening these students may require that we build some remediation into our programs.  Our decisions to include more writing and math in what we do came out of our experiences in the first few years.  We tried to give early participants a great program but they were simply unprepared to assimilate it. You can not teach a student oceanography without a good math base; we had to back up a bit and do some catching up.    A challenge we often see with our students is a simple lack of confidence.  In reality, we can't teach confidence. However, we can give students the tools to make them successful.  Success breeds confidence.  Our students are isolated in the woods of northwest Washington in an environment that is totally foreign biologically, culturally, socially and academically. It can be a daunting challenge and not one that would necessarily inspire self-confidence. But, as our faculty and staff, who are genuinely interested in the students, work with them daily, helping them develop skills and building their resumes, we begin to see changes. They become more confident and motivated.  It is a wonderful process  The major challenge to our program over the years has been recruiting.  When people ask, ""How do you recruit?"" we answer, ""Any way we possibly can"". When we started the program, we took the logical, generally accepted approach of sending out mass mailings. In fact, that turned out to be the least effective way to find applicants.  We continue to do mass mailings in the hope that the information will reach potential applicants, but it is not a terribly effective way to recruit.    What HAS worked for the past decade is to get on the phone and call our professional colleagues asking, ""Do you have a student?"" Successful recruiting requires someone to go out in the hall, the classroom or the lab, grab a student by the arm, pull them into the office and ask, ""Have you thought of this?"" Conversations with our alumni indicate that many had seen our flyers but thought, ""Oh, I can't do that. My GPA is not high enough.  I don't have any experience. I would never get in"".  Fortunately, we have found faculty champions in a few universities and marine labs who really make an effort to look around and encourage students. They are making a difference for our program and for these students.  Q:  Do you have a website?  A:  We have had a website for 9 years. It is a well-designed site with everything from program description and student research to student outcomes. We have not tracked the number of hits the page receives. However, this year we added an on-line application and found that our applications came in much sooner. We know, therefore, that we are reaching students. It appears that allowing students to apply on line is going to help our recruiting.  We are still not getting large numbers of applications, but we do seem to be reaching people a little easier.   Q:  So just having information on the website is important, but just as important is having the means to apply on the site?  A:  Yes. That has been an important improvement for us.   Q:   About how many students do you bring into this program?  A:  We bring in 8 students a year. That allows us to work closely with individual students.  Q:  Do you track to see what happens after students leave the program?  A:  Yes, we track them very closely. Students in our program find themselves in a small field laboratory, generally far from home.  In these circumstances, they really bond to one another and to the laboratory.  We don't have to put a lot of effort into tracking them.  They are our friends and friends stay in touch.  We hear from most of them regularly; they have been very successful.  Of our 87 alumni, 2 have completed PhD's and are currently in post-doctoral positions. Six more are currently working on PhD's. Twelve alumni have finished MS degrees and 17 more are currently in MS program.  A number of the remaining students are still working on undergraduate degrees and several are currently applying for graduate programs.  Vergun  I am a professor in the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University  (OSU) in Corvallis, Oregon. I am a scientist - a plant community ecologist. Most of the work I do focuses on Native American programs such as research in natural resources, education, and traditional ecological knowledge on reservations and ceded lands also working in Native America on the Mainland and in Alaska and Hawaii.  The Native Americans in Marine and Space Sciences Program, our parent program began about 12 years ago because we were interested in increasing the number of Native students in Marine Sciences. Our initial and sustaining funding is from the National Science Foundation Ocean Sciences Division. When OSU became a NASA Space Grant institution and I became Oregon Space Grant Associate Director, we dedicated funds to expand our Native programs. What that really means is that we provide paid internships for Native undergraduates in all science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines - anything slightly wet, slightly salty, anything to do with the environment - which is just about everything!  Students in our program at OSU participate in full year research experiences for undergraduates. During the academic year, they are allowed to work up to 20 hours a week in a research experience of there own choice, with a mentor of their own choice then full time during summers and holidays, if they wish.  This program is offered to Native students who are enrolled in Oregon State University but participate in programs in other institutions, especially Brian Bingham's and Ben Cuker's. This is one of the really valuable things - networking with other strong programs that support minorities. Please take a look at the sheet I've handed out to you. It is a description of our programs and a chart that shows our parent program, the Native Americans in Marine and Space Sciences Program, and the outreach in three areas: Pre-college Programs, Education, and Community Projects with links to our Pacific Traditional Ecological Knowledge Program for Native graduate students.    We developed this program network because it was immediately apparent, when we began our NAMSS program almost 12 years ago, that it didn't do any good to have a wonderful program for Native students at the university if almost no Native students were attending the university!  Therefore, we served the few students who were then attending OSU while we quickly developed an outreach strategy to bring more Native youth to our university.    Also important to remember, is that once students are enrolled in the university, they need to feel a sense of belonging. Students are not comfortable in a learning institution where their cultures are marginalized or invisible in the curricula. Therefore we design and continue to teach coursework that is culturally competent and that attains Native community 'buy in' to our post-secondary education.  We continue to develop these courses through our Intertribal Programs Office in the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences to serve the whole university.  Native undergraduates in our program are working with the Native youth in all of these outreach programs in many communities, therefore, they are visible role models. And we keep in touch with everyone - students and community throughout the years. In other words, we track our students beyond graduation at OSU.  Also, we have mentors from not only the scientific arena and engineering at our university but also from Federal and state agencies and private corporations. We have a real breadth of opportunity for our students to understand what is going on out there in the world and get some ideas for their career choices - most students don't have an idea of what choices they have and, therefore, cannot make very good choices. They are limited in their own environment.  To a certain degree, I think that this is true for most students but especially for Native youth from reservations or isolated, rural settings. They have a harder time because they see that life only and it is not always the bigger picture of the world and all the opportunities that exist.  So that is why we have this huge network of programs and opportunities - to introduce students to a broad array of choices.  Many different foundations fund us and we are working with many different organizations to put this whole outreach program together and keep it running.  We probably have approximately 400 people on staff throughout this whole network; therefore, we've provided a huge holistic network for K-12 and post-secondary and for communities. That is the main reason we have been successful.  Statistically, in 12 years, 98% of more than 100 students have earned Bachelor of Science degrees within 5 years or less. Forty-seven percent have continued in graduate programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  Many of our students are now employed as senior scientists in their fields.  Because we have this network of graduated NAMSS participants nation-wide, our current students have been able to participate in more and more opportunities nationally and go on exchanges to spend time with those peers. They become part of a bigger global family in a network larger than the one we provide in our home location.  These programs have been so successful that our African American and Chicano/a families asked us to develop the same opportunities for their students. So we developed the Diversity Internship Program (DIP) which has been on the ground here for five years with the same results. It has been really exciting!  A funny thing happened when we named the program. In our haste to name the program, we didn't notice that the acronym was DIP. So the students are DIPS!  But we've made it fun by having a theme song ""Dippity Do-Dah"" and chip-dip contests and things like that.  Effective programs need to be personal to create a family that works together and solves problems together.   My background? I have actually changed careers a couple of times. For 15 years I was in advertising, film and television.  I made television commercials, was involved in movie making and that sort of thing.  When my three daughters were very young, I decided I would like to change professions by going back to school and earning advanced degrees in something environmentally friendly, rather than continue to work in advertising all the products that were destroying the environment.  And I wanted a nice, safe, comfortable, affordable place for my children to grow up. I chose Oregon and we leased a farm near Corvallis, Oregon and Oregon State University. My temporary move here was in 1978!    I want to say something about growing up.  I'm American Indian on my father's side and my Mother is Scottish and Welsh.  My father was a Geologist and he would take me with him when he was working and he would tell me things about how to survive outdoors.  He taught me how to find water and food.  If you are really hungry in the winter, coyotes can help you hunt. I thought everybody learned that stuff growing up.  I thought that was Geology and when you go to school and you take Geology you learn that. There are all those sorts of things that he taught me in addition to what is taught in mainstream schools. So when I went to school and we were out on some of our field trips, some people were talking about how they did not like the red ants. I said, ""But they are good for finding water.""  And nobody understood what I meant. And I realized I was the only one who had the concept. Dad taught me to appreciate everything in nature, because everything in nature has its place. So if there is a red anthill in a very high dry desert area, you will find water underneath the anthill but you must not disturb their homeplace. Therefore you do not drill down through the anthill; you drill in diagonally at an angle that reaches just below their home.  You respect their home, thank them for showing you where the water is and don't disturb them - and otherwise, you might get stung!    Here's what I learned about the coyotes and hunting in the winter: if you are really, really hungry, and you are out in a winter camp, and you hear coyotes, you listen to which kind of call they use.  Are they teaching their young how to talk and how to communicate? Or are you hearing the sound of yapping because of a kill.  You need to learn the different sounds and what they mean. If the coyotes have gotten a deer or something and they are not that far from you, you can sneak up very quietly and surprise them quickly, run and grab a hunk of meat and run away really fast and they won't bother you. You just take a small amount and they won't follow you because they have all the rest for themselves. You have caught them by surprise and have a short window of time to run in and get something and leave.  Pack rats carry a lot of interesting things to their dens like nuts and seeds and other plant materials.  You can actually learn a lot about the ecosystem from this cache - or you can eat the nuts and the seeds!  These are the kind of things that I thought everybody knew. When I got into formal science courses I learned not to mention these things because I looked kind of ridiculous in those classes and people thought I was weird.  And the point of this is that, in fact, those things I learned from Dad are true. I grew up understanding science from that perspective.  And it is also true that most of our science curricula still do not include that indigenous perspective. I see that our Native or minority students are marginalized or completely invisible in most current curricula or educational programs.  For education, programs and organizations to be successful and diverse, different ways of knowing and thinking must be respected and incorporated in a relevant way. I just wanted to tell that personal story to demonstrate that how you feel about something or someplace is what's important. If you feel that you are silly or stupid, you don't want to stay.    Hoskins:  My name is Dionne Hoskins, as Matt said I am a fisheries biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service.  I am permanently stationed at Savannah State University.  I am not a temporary loan or a tenure-year track faculty; I am a permanent research scientist at a historically black serving university.  I completed my dissertation at the University of South Carolina and am a benthic ecologist by training.  I am particularly interested in the uptake of microbial extracellular polymeric secretions  (EPS) by deposit feeding invertebrates.  That is my research area.  My programmatic background is that I have participated in virtually every program that has been offered here except for Brian's.  I am a graduate of Savannah State University- I was taught by Matt Gilligan. I was in the first cohort of students who participated in the Hampton-ASLO partnership that Ben does, and I have participated in that student program since 1989.  I was a graduate assistant for the Bridge program that Savannah State offers with the NSF. I was a Southern Regional Education Board dissertation fellow. And I was a co-op student through Brad at the Charleston NOS laboratory.  So I have participated in a number of these programs.  And things that are geared to the success of minority students, and I think they work, for the most part.    Currently what I am doing at Savannah State, in addition to starting up my own research,  is continuing to work on microbial EPS. I am focusing on a local cyanobacterial mat. I want to characterize the sugars present.   But what I am doing programmatically is trying to increase the number of underrepresented minorities that get funneled into jobs into NOAA or into academia, or into other Government services.  One of the grants I have received to do so is a Sea Grant sponsored program. It is an aquaculture program that we are doing in partnership with the South Carolina Department of Natural Marine Resources and with the University of Georgia Marine Extension Service.  From that program we choose 4 interns per year, 2 interns go to MAREX UGA one stays on campus and works with me and one goes the Waddell Mariculture Center. On campus at Savannah State, to develop hands on learning in aquaculture, we have started a Spartina alterniflora greenhouse.  Savannah State University is on the Marsh.  Our back yard is total marsh, so what we are doing is using our back yard, and growing those plants, and cultivating them to get a renewable crop inside the green house that we can use for restoration.    Additionally, I have started a Minority Mentorship in Science Seminar series (MMISS), a program to bring minority scientists that look like me to Savannah State University.  One of the first things that I noticed when I got to campus was that the students were very hungry to not just see minority scientists but to see younger ones.  You just don't know how entertained they were to see me to be in the lab, washing glassware, listening to the same music as they were.  It was really, really interesting, for me to experience. So the MMISS program is designed to fly in at least one scientist per month. I have gotten such a strong response, even with limited funds, individuals are willing to come free, that it looks like I might be able to bring in 2-3 per month, between now and May.  Another program that we have started is the academic computing facility.  I got this program with a post doc who was at Savannah State University, Ashanti Johnson Pyrtle. And she and I were responding to the need for more technological growth for undergraduates.  We developed a computing facility in which students can come in with raw data on paper from their internships or from classes, enter them into excel or access and analyze the data.  If they have other types of geographical data they will be trained how to enter that into ArcView and use GIS.  They can come in with raw data, perform the analysis and get the product.  With a research poster, a power point presentation or anything of that nature, the purpose of this was to show students the beginning and the end of how science is done.  We are really happy with that.    Part of what I wanted to offer as part of my participation in this panel, is what we have talked about, that there are minorities available, that there are minority scientists, and that 20-30-40 years ago this was not the case.  We have talked about how there are programs that work in terms of preparing undergraduates to consider careers in Marine and Environmental sciences. And part of that is, what to do when someone has gotten an advanced degree, what do we do with them when they are ready to enter into the work force? How do we receive them so they have viability at a marine laboratory?  How do you get them to stay and to flourish versus getting there and getting turned off of research or getting there and feeling that it is an inhospitable environment?  One of the first things I would say is that there should be recognition and sensitivity to cultural differences.  That is very intuitive and often times difficult for a person to execute in a scientific community.  It is pretty homogeneous.  As a federal employee, one of the first things I noticed when I went to a federal lab is that diversity is assumed, it is automatically assumed, and that if you go to some academic institutions, diversity is ignored.  People enjoy the homogeneity of having all these scientists focusing on a single area like the microbial group or the ecology group of professors, or the physical oceanography group of professors. We don't really see the recognition, much less the celebration of diversity in that group.  But there should be recognition of the diversity and sensitivity that those individuals are bringing to a marine laboratory, and there should be an avoidance of the n=1 approach. I was looking for something else on the Internet and I bumped into an article that Dr. Clifford Poodry (who directs the minority outreach programs of NIH) had written about using n=1 as our sample size.    How we are going to handle minorities in a particular program? Sometimes someone like me is using her own personal experience to determine how she is going to develop programs. Or sometimes it's a laboratory or an academic institution that has only had one minority, or two minorities and they are using the experience of that minority to determine how they are going to handle others.  And I personally have seen situations, where one graduate student comes in and that graduate student sets a tone or has an experience and the faculty member thinks, "" I have a model. I am going to use what I have learned from working with this student and I'm going to work with the next students."" Look at  it from this perspective however, it is like having Denzel Washington as one student, and then Chris Rock comes in and you handle him the same way.  It does not work, it can't. Sarah Bernhardt and Winona Ryder? You cannot use the same system.  You can not use the same formulaic method to deal with those individuals. There has to be sensitivity to the growth that a faculty member or a lab may experience, by interaction with their first or first few minority researchers, but there is enough literature available on minority education in the sciences to give us an idea of what the broad-based strategy should be.  And then you can tailor those strategies to proceed with a productive investigation at your laboratory.  There is a dire need of intellectual engagement for minority scientists.   Its important that a researcher at any institution be engaged scientifically and not be placed in a situation where the only time that we [the minority] can talk to them [the peer scientists] when they have a new cutting social issue that they want to talk about.  ""Let's talk about affirmative action,"" ""No, I want to talk about bacterial slime."" Sometimes I do want to talk about the current issues that affect me, that affect the institution and are of national importance, but sometimes a scientist just wants to be engaged about his or her science.  If you are not regularly getting that, then basically you are being passively ostracized.  Not actively ostracized, because ""I don't want to talk to you"" but passively ostracized because you are being passed over when those kinds of conversations are happening.  That is frustrating and it creates a hostile environment and you don't see yourself putting roots down.  To yourself you say ""ok, this is temporary- I will be here 2, 3 years. I will be in this post doc, for one year, and I will leave and I will not consider applying for a position here"", or ""I will just be a visiting teaching position."" And then the minority scientist will leave, not feeling like a major contributor.   And this leads into the fact that minority researchers, minority students and researchers, need the same kind of faculty membership and directional development that every other brand new graduate and Ph.D. is going to need. They are going to need advice, input and support by individuals who have reached that same professional milestone and have gone past it, to understand ""How do you navigate your career?"" and ""How you engineer the career that you want to have?"" And this maybe in the form of guidance on office and scientific politics.  ""What editor of what journal do you not want to send your manuscript to because they have issues?""  Or ""what journal, if you really need a publication to come out this year, what journal do you not need to send it to vs. another journal because their turnover time is 6 or 9 months?""  For things of that nature we need an individual, or persons to call on for lack of a better term- Frentorship, the friendship and mentorship that helps us grow and become the productive scientists that they want to be.  This is a key to a person's sustainability regardless of their race.   I am going to add one resource to the list of books, texts and websites that is on the handout that was passed out earlier.  The book is called ""Succeeding in an Academic Career:  A Guide for Faculty of Color"" It was published in July of 2000 and was edited by Mildred Garcia (Garcia 2000).  I recently read this and it is a chapter-by-chapter guide on how to navigate your career if you are a faculty person of color, especially if you are at a majority institution.  It talks about issues of productivity and office politics; it also talks about issues of balance, if you are a person like me who is pulled in a direction to address issues of minority in sciences but is also very important to advance in the development of your own science.  It also addresses times and places where you have the obligation or feel compelled to mentor the students who come to you at universities, especially if you are the only minority person in your area- as I am at Savannah State University.  As some other faculty are at other universities.  You get pulled in all kinds of directions to be that voice of diversity.  This book has a chapter on how to be effective in being who you are, or how to continue to grow while at the same time contributing.  I have asked that the Vice President of Academic Affairs give this as a gift to all incoming faculty, saying ""Here use this guide, come to me with any questions.""  I would also like to say that I will be around for the rest of the meeting and happy to take questions.  Cuker:  I am Ben Cuker and I am from Hampton University.  Hampton is a historically black college, it started its marine sciences program in early 1980's and traces its beginning to the efforts of Anita Hall a woman who worked on her Ph.D. at Scripts but never got it, because of the politics of the era.  We have graduated over a 100 students now in Marine and Environmental Science all but 2-3 have been African American Students. Some have gone on for there Ph.D.' s and they are employed at the U.S. EPA and at several different universities and consulting firms.  It has been a successful program. Another thing I do is run the ASLO (American Society of Limnology and Oceanography).  This well known program goes back to 1989.   Prior to moving to Hampton in 1988, I spent 7 years working at Shaw University also an HBCU. When I used to go to ASLO meetings, the one or two black folks there would be visiting scientists from Africa.  So I whined about it a lot and got up and complained about it a lot at the ASLO business meetings, and wrote letters to the leadership.  Eventually one of the Presidents (and a former professor of mine from Michigan), Claire Schelske, appointed a committee with me as chair to address the diversity issue.   SAML played an essential role in this, because SAML in 1989 had NSF money to address the diversity issue, so the politics of this is that SAML wanted some more support from NSF, so NSF said 'do something about diversity'.   In response, they put together an excellent series of workshops.  It seems we reinvent wheels all the time.  If one goes back to that original SAML report, it is clear that the road map for building diversity is there.  The ASLO program brings about 70 minority students (undergraduate and graduate) and mentors to the annual meetings. We have a keynote speaker, a notable person of society help kickoff the pre-conference workshops. The ASLO president usually brings greetings too. We always have a field trip to an aquatic setting, and hold sessions on skill building for the students.  The students are assigned to ""meeting mentors"" who help them navigate the sessions and plan their participation. They have a workbook that they fill out to help in this process, and it includes places to critique talks and posters.  There is a student symposium where the students present work from REUs, or a proposal for the research that they do.  As the students grow they are expected, and do present their work in the regular sessions in subsequent years.   LAST SENTENCE UNCLEAR  There is another program I created called MAST , Minorities At Sea Together.  It's a program that I have run now for two years. I was fortunate enough to get a Pew Fellowship in Marine Conservation, basically for the ASLO work.  And I use this to bring in a dozen minority students from all over the U. S. we sail up to the Chesapeake bay for 3 weeks on a 53 foot ketch.  We do a combination of marine science, marine policy, African American Heritage on the water  (I have now also incorporated  some Native American Heritage as well), and of course sailing.  We spend 3 weeks sailing the entire length of the Chesapeake Bay with stops at all of the major laboratories, museums, governmental agencies, conservation groups, and ports. Three of our hosts belong to NAML, The Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, Horn Point Laboratory, and the Virginia Inst. of Marine Science. All are wonderful hosts.  I have a video made by a student who was a media arts major.    A lot of great points have been made so far.   I want to bring up the issue of graduate school transition.  Back when the original SAML meeting was convened we were really looking hard at getting undergraduates into aquatic sciences.  But since then we have been very successful with programs like those run by Dr. Gilligan, Dr. Vergun, and Dr. Bingham, with of course all the  behind the scenes work done by Dr. Brad Brown.  We see a living example right here with Dr. Dionne Hoskins, who went through Dr. Gilligan's programs as well as the ASLO program.  We are producing a substantial number of students who have environmental or marine backgrounds.   If you turn to page 19 of the article I had in the ASLO bulletin.  If you look at table 2, the percentage of 12th graders scoring below basic proficiency in Math, note for whites it is 21% and for minorities it is 50% and over. So we know right away that when minority students are coming out of High School there are going to be deficiencies in the quantitative sciences and this of course is a bellweather for the sciences in general with quantitative issues.  So programs must be prepared to address that when students come in.   In table  3,  Percentage of total college population, African Americans 11.1 % which is not bad, since the national black population is around 12%.  What happens as we proceed through degrees, when we get down to a very low % of Science and Engineering PhD's, only 2.9 %. For whites, percentages hold strong all the way through the advanced degrees.  So we know the students are going to college. Seven percent of Science and Engineering degrees and B.S. degrees are going to African Americans, that is not all that bad. These students are out there and they are poised to go on to graduate education, but we see it is really not happening in a big way.  And the numbers repeat for Hispanics and Natives Americans as well.    What are we going to do about this?  Well, a lot of the success and if you read Matt's article, on the success of his programs at Savannah State, a lot of it has to do with taking a focused approach.  Also to quote Matt, ""Traditional methods bring traditional results.""  If you keep on doing the same thing, we are going to keep on having the one ""Dionne"" here and there, but no real progress.  So, let's throw the old model out the window. Brad said something important. When students come out, it is not a matter of finding a position available for the student. It is matter of creating a position that matches where the student is.  This flies in the face of the ""meritocracy"" arguments.  If you embrace the meritocracy arguments and you take the California, or Texas position you are saying, ""When people apply we simply continue to take the best,"" expect the same traditional results. The numbers of minorities will stay low. We have got to throw that out. Yes, all students accepted must be capable of completing the program successfully.  But we have to look beyond traditional indicators of success.  Universities are social institutions that need to serve the needs of the society.  They do not serve these needs when they use admission policies that systematically block minority students.  The people that pay the taxes to support the universities include minorities. What we need to do is produce students to serve the entire society.  That means we need to get rid of criteria that try to sort out very fine differences, when what we really want to know is if a student can succeed in a program.  Will they be a good scientist when they are done?  The real question is not whether their GRE's or SAT's were higher than somebody else's, those are irrelevant in trying to produce students, it is can we find a program that can help them meet there full potential?  So you have got to throw out the meritocracy argument, and say, if the student has the ability, (let them in)..  You have got to work with your colleagues on that because it will always be, ""well, he got that because of affirmative action.""  That residue stays there at all times. We have got to get rid of that because diversity is important for the success of any program.  People like to affiliate. When 18-year-olds go to college, the first thing they do is find other people like themselves.  People like to affiliate in groups and distinguish themselves from others.  And that is just true.  So when you go into these marine laboratory centers, what you find is people affiliate, like Dionne said, Microbial groups get together, fish people group together, people don't get invited to parties just because of that.  This is the reality of the situation.    We have to move beyond this tendency to affiliate in exclusionary ways and instead embrace diversity.  Diversity is a good thing for the success of the laboratory and the success of the science.  We all know what happens when there is too much inbreeding in the science. The science does not go anywhere.  This is where diversity will promote the success of the science. The argument for diversity is not based upon social engineering, but rather on the success of the science. When you bring people in with different perspectives then you will help the science grow in different ways.  One thing we really need is to have the same kind of atmosphere available for minority students in graduate school that they find at these undergraduate programs where there is concentration of other minority students.  The University of Maryland, Eastern Shore (an HBCU) is in association with Horn Point Lab. They are starting to build a program.  But their graduate program historically, even though it's a minority serving institution has been mostly white.  They are working hard on changing that. The University of Puerto Rico has done some really great things, and we need to look at linking with them more closely.  What really needs to happen is that  more major institutions need to affiliate with minority serving institutions and create a focused program.  To have a place where minority students will be brought in together for their Ph.D., I'm not talking about Masters degrees, I'm talking about Ph.D.s.   If you look at the article on the next page, table 5, you will see results from a survey completed by the students participating in the ASLO program last February.   I asked them straight out, if you want to go to graduate school, would you prefer to go to a targeted program where there are going to be other minorities students and there will be a program tailored to your success, and where there is going to be cultural competency built in for the faculty as well as for the students.  If you look at the results it is overwhelming yes.  Now this is not a model for every single minority student. There are minority students who have gone through the majority schools and they have made it through and it is going to continue to be that way.  But the minority students are not coming through at a fast enough rate.  It is time for us to try a concentrated model like this.  I think we will have success. This is not my total invention here.  Maryland has a program in Mathematics, which they have done like this, unfortunately they have lost their funding because of the whole meritocracy issue in Maryland.  But once they hit critical mass, African American students go there now because they know they are going to get through the program with an excellent degree and they are going to succeed.   Now what this means is if you represent an institution that is not directly involved in this, you may think well, the minority students, are going to be siphoned off from your potential institution. Well tough, you have got to get out there and compete!  Support this and then you can go out and hire one of these men or woman to come to your program. So I guess maybe a Woods Hole might feel slighted by this sort of program, but they will benefit by being able to hire faculty coming out of this program.    Gilligan:  I offer a couple of examples of collaboration between Savannah State University, an historically- black unit of the University System of Georgia, and  two marine science institutions that have significantly increased minority participation.  The summer of 2002 will be the ninth year of a non-traditional collaborative research experiences for undergraduates program funded by NSF.  It targets what Sue Cook, Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (HBOI), and I thought were some of the key issues in the pathways to science careers among minority students that needed to be addressed.  The term ""pipeline"" has been overused and there is a couple of reasons for not using it: one, pointed out by Judy Gobert at a meeting at NSF, is that does not have positive connotations among Native Americans from Alaska (oil pipelines) and the other is that it implies only one 'correct' path and does not suggest that alternative route choices may exist or be necessary along the way, which is more the reality for folks from underrepresented groups.  Our REU recruits nationally from early undergraduate ranks while they are still deciding on a major and gives them a 'bridging' experience from classroom to research environments by combining lectures, labs and field trips to research institutions for four weeks at SSU to more formal research projects at HBOI for five weeks.   In most REU programs, mentors and researchers want to get students who are farther along - rising seniors who have had all their sciences who are ready to be pre-graduate students.  We take them from an earlier stage of their development with the expectation that they will acquire the skills and confidence enabling them to successfully compete for more typical REU programs which happens at a high rate.  Also it's quite interesting to see the added extras that good experiences at a historically black college can provide for students from large majority institutions no mater their ethnicity.  The other collaborative program that we have is the Collaboration to Integrate Research and Education (CIRE) program with the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO), a non-instructional unit of the University System of Georgia.  Principally because of the close geographic proximity  and complementary missions within the same state system, this project has been remarkably successful. Unprecedented numbers of undergraduates from SSU have participated in research, have become technicians after graduation, and some are applying to the new collaborative M.S. degree in Marine Sciences at SSU.  I think the keys have been equity in terms of effort and commitment on the part of the administrations.  Though principally undergraduate institutions, minority institutions don't deserve to be cast as junior partners in such collaborations such that they are viewed as only able to provide a nurturing environment for undergraduates in the classroom without capacity and desire to be research universities.  Likewise, the majority research institution must be, and probably prefer to be viewed as, more than 'we'll take it from here' research experience provider in their laboratories.  Many minority institutions, and most are small,  have faculty who do research and provide research experiences for students even with limited resources.  That number needs to grow to see more results. I don't think you will find a single small institution, minority or otherwise, that does not want to increase the access and exposure that their undergraduates have to research environments and laboratories. Enhancing the capacity for research at minority institutions and support for education at research labs are important terms in the dynamics of collaboration.  There must be real benefits to the research institution involved because there is a real cost of involving undergraduates in research. These costs are faculty and staff time, supplies, ship/boat time and wear and tear on facilities. Outreach, education and the integration of research and education at both kinds of institutions have real costs.   I think that there may be some misconception regarding the national talent pool.  While the statistics show that minority institutions contribute disproportionally to minority graduates in sciences and that most minority Ph.D.s are earned by those who attended them at some point, there are a lot of minorities at majority serving institutions.  Unfortunately, they may be mismatched to the institution if they have an interest in marine science but find themselves at an institution with appropriate support for their aspirations (curriculum, mentors, REU programs).  I have learned this from the African Americans attending majority institutions who have participated in our summer REU program. Measurable changes in participation and granting of advanced degrees nationally will require that both pools be tapped and that greater demand for access among minorities in general be created by better public information. Since career conceptions are developed early, K-12 information is essential. SAML took the lead in that vein by agreeing to support the development of the 'Bridging the Gap; Minorities in Marine Science' video in 1994.  CD copies of the updated 2000 version have been distributed here. It is available on both CD and VHS tape from SSU.  It hasn't been easy to grow a marine science program at SSU.  Just ask Margaret Robinson who conceived the program at SSU in the late 1970s and Brad Brown who's been there all along the way.  The results of the efforts have been phenomenal, though.  Replicating the long term efforts that went into helping the administration and others understand what kinds of commitments are necessary to grow a programs and collaborations is necessary.  New faculty given the challenge of developing a new programs or emphasis in aquatic sciences may be up against steep odds  - it is important that they be supported.     Follow up Discussion  Cuker:  A person should be designated with the responsibility to make sure that any program really works.  Often programs are adopted, but nobody is brought to task to for whether or not they function and it has not been one of the major parts of responsibility.  Maybe it is added on as something else with everything else that they do.  The point is that in order to make a focus point work, someone really needs to be in charge and see it through.  Our point is that the importance of peer support which is linked to critical mass.  Students have to be brought in with peers, with whom they can connect and learn with.  We learn as much from our near peers as we did from our professors.  You run a program you are not going to bring in a minority student you are going to bring in students.  And the importance of a structure approach.  An example of a class that he had as a graduate student, this is how you put together a talk, this is how you prepare a paper, all those things that in those programs are not necessarily structured in there and are kind of taken for granted.  A lot of people take a focused approach, which is kind of appropriate.    We hear this all the time, changing the award structure for faculty.  It is one thing to encourage to take on minority students and to get that much more involved.  Another thing to do is to recognize a reward system, a rewards system is 70% driven by publications and grants - teaching and other work make up the rest. You can be rotten at the latter two and it really does not matter - we have all sat on these (promotion and tenure) committees.  If we are serious about this, a faculty person may be faced with these.  I am up for tenure in two years.  Do I want to take on a minority student, who may be a perfectly good student on paper but maybe I am not connecting with them because I don't have the cultural similarities.  Or am I going to take on a ""Joe"" who is just like me.  That decision process goes on, and if we are going to expect faculty to try and move out of there own boxes, then we are going to have to structure award systems that has this sort of reward and recognition built in to its institutional values.  In promoting diversity an institution has to be really behind it, not just in name but also in institutional resources.  The institution should be proud of the fact that they are producing minority students and celebrate that rather than just some other box to check off.    Gilligan:  The same may be true to some extent for program managers and proposal reviewers at agencies.  Proposal review criteria concerning the broader impact on society and diversity impact, though touted by agency and division directors, are not always put into practice by reviewers, managers and panels. The conviction to respect these criteria must reach both ways: bottom up from reviewers and top down from officials in order to end up in the critical places where funding recommendations and decisions are made.  Accountability at performance review or promotion/tenure time will get attention and be incorporated into institutional values.  Hoskins:  The conversations that our group focused primarily on, ""If I have a minority student, and I've never worked with an underrepresented minority and there are no other underrepresented minorities in my program, what do I start with what do I do?""  And ""How do we sustain a minority faculty member and how do we deal with the issues and needs that we have with diversity without over taxing that individual?""  The answer to the discussion that came out of the person asking about ""how to help a minority student"". My answer was to get them involved in the community- the community of underrepresented minorities who are in Marine, Environmental Sciences. The easiest way to do that is to get them involved in a program, like Ben's program which is the largest. That program, puts students together and builds an instant community.  Because we are networked, once you get on the list for Ben's program and go to the ASLO program, you are automatically going to be on the list for anything I'm doing, or what Matt is doing or anything that Judith and Brian are doing.  Get a minority student involved in the national community even if there is not a local community. Get them in contact with individuals who have similar concerns or are similar to themselves.  And it makes them feel less intellectually isolated and less culturally isolated, even if they just happen to be culturally isolated where they are.  They get on email and talk to a friend of theirs at VIMS that is having the same issue that they are having, and it also builds a connection and the ability for them to deal with other issues that will evolve as they advance as graduate students:  whether or not to get married and have children in grad school, the concept of graduate student rights and how well they are respected at one  "

I am still in shock from getting a better verbal score than math.  Oh well, I definitely can't complain about a 710.

I don't believe that I would have done as well without the recommended outline and structure.  Your timing on the Quant section was spot on.

I also scored a  5.5 on the AWA section for 87th percentile ranking. Your GMAT prep course was a major factor in my success, and I must thank you for the thorough preparation you offered. I believe that I now have a competitive shot at admission to Columbia Business school.     As you are aware, I took the Veritas Elite GMAT course in Washington D.C. in Oct/Nov. 2005, and I felt that the Veritas Elite  Prep course lacked the necessary tools and methodology that could help me successfully prepare for the GMAT test.  When I first received your pre-class GMAT training files, I realized that your GMAT course was undoubtedly better than that offered by Veritas Elite! Although the majority of the information i had studied did not show up on the test, i felt prepared to deal with any problem that could have been thrown at me.  Veritas only prepared me for the most common problems which could be asked.  I also want to let you know that the incredible detail you pack into each GMAT study and training file allowed me to prepare for each GMAT section in the required depth.  Veritas Prep just put out some stuff out there and forced you to memorize concepts, hoping its crash course would provide enough of the tools necessary to solve most of the problems.   Veritas prep materials also lacked the depth and quality of training that MLIC offered.

Our Turboprep GMAT course participant writes: ""A lawyer admitted to the bar in Munich Germany, I attempted to take the GMAT, knowing that my challenge was in the GMAT Math area. I took a GMAT prep course conducted by a German testpreparation company in Frankfurt and found that the level of teaching involved very simple GMAT problems, even worse than those taught in Kaplan GMAT prep or Princeton Review GMAT classes. After scoring 570 on the GMAT in my first attempt, I researched on the Internet GMAT prep courses and enrolled in the GMAT prep class offered by an American testpreparation Company, MLIC, New York. MLIC GMAT preparation course, besides offering excellent GMAT study and GMAT training materials, also reinforces the learning process with original GMAT questions. The individual attention received from dedicated instructor in the MLIC GMAT class helps one overcome his or her weakness in Mathematics and in Verbal areas of GMAT. Result: I scored 670 on the GMAT.

WHAT IS GMAT® CAT?                  GMAT® , acronym for  G raduate  M anagement  A dmission  T est, is administered by Pearson Vue® on behalf of GMAC® and is required by all  G raduate  S chools of  B usiness for admission purposes.               The GMAT, according to  GMAC                (Graduate Management Admission Council that owns the trademarks GMAT®  and GMAT CAT®, is one measure of your ability to successfully              complete the first year of graduate study program (MBA degree program) at a Graduate School of Business.However, effective January 2006, the paper and pencil version of the GMAT test is no longer offered anywhere in the world. GMATis              administered in a CAT(Computer Adaptive) format in which the GMAT test'adapts' the              difficulty level of GMAT questions to your GMAT-specific 'comfort level', with 'higher              difficulty level GMAT questions' carrying higher GMAT raw scores (GMAT Scaled              Scores) than do 'lower difficulty level' GMAT questions. The              GMAT tests your Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning skills, and your ability (i) to process information in context, (ii) to make necessarily true and probable interpretations of information presented, and (iii) to test different scenarios for consistency of decisions. The test also is about your ability to determine whether GMAT sentences are logically, clearly, correctly, and effectively written.  The GMAT  has three              assessment areas:    AWA  (Analytical Writing Assessment)              that requires you to write Two essays, one analyzing an Issue              and the other analyzing an Argument. This first essay section on the GMAT is not 'adaptive'              and receives a separate score of between 0 and 6.   GMAT Quantitative Assessment  is the first              of the two 'adaptive' sections on the GMAT and follows the Analytical Writing section, and requires that you              answer 37 questions in problem solving and in Data Sufficiency in 75 minutes. Following the GMAT Quantitative section, you will be required to work on the last 'adaptive' section on              the GMAT is  Verbal              Assessment , which requires that you answer 41              questions in 75 minutes. The GMAT Verbal assessment includes three sections: GMAT Critical Reasoning, GMAT Sentence Correction, and GMAT Reading Comprehension. GMAT adaptive sections also include              experimental questions, at least 9 in GMAT Quantitative assessment and 11              in GMAT Verbal assessment. The two adaptive sections on the GMAT receive a combined             score of between 200 and 800. Most A-List Business Schools rated in the top-10 will              require a GMAT test score of at least 650 in order for you to be              competitive. Your best chance for success lies in your ability to              take the GMAT exam at the high difficulty level throughout.

TESTIMONIALS ABOUT MLIC GMAT COURSES     ""I was a trainee in your Gmat turboprep course in London during January 2008, and received a score of 710 when I took the exam 10 days after the course. Having worked through other prep materials available from book stores, I was impressed with your study guides and training materials that covered the Gmat sections in great depth. Your training methods and strategies for verbal sections were brilliant. Last but not least, your Gmat trainer was witty and competent, and explained how different areas of the Gmat test the same skills.  Your prep methods work.  Cheers.           --  Scott Sheldon , GMAT TURBOPREP® Course, London Paddington, January 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 02/08 .""   ""This is Stacey Yeong, your GMAT Turboprep course participant in Singapore. I took my GMAT test in December and I am very happy to let you know that I scored 750 on the GMAT exam, with 44 in the GMAT verbal section and 49 in the GMAT quantitative section. This is a tremendous jump from my previous GMAT score of 610. The biggest difference to my total GMAT score came from the verbal section.I would really like to thank you for the GMAT prep course which made me understand the GMAT verbal section much, much better. I have changed my selection of Business schools because of the better than expected GMAT score. Thanks for your excellent GMAT training class and your patient support throughout. I strongly recommend MLIC GMAT prep course offered in Singapore.               -----Stacey Yeong, Singapore Turboprep course participant and  GMAT Hall of Famer .   "" ""I want to thank you for an excellent GMAT prep class in New York City. I am happy to report a score of 730 on the test that I took 10 days after the turboprep class in Manhattan.  Your GMAT course is the best for the following reasons:  (1) your study materials are the most thorough I have seen of any prep materials for the GMAT I have worked through; (2) The quality of in-class training was outstanding. The instructor was knowledgeable and patient; and (3) the course had a great structure, with the pre-class training assignments providing the required exposure to the concepts tested on the GMAT. The training materials covered the very basic to the most advanced, and were laid out in easy to follow format.  I have no hesitation in recommending MLIC prep course for the GMAT.           --  Nathaniel Johnson , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, New York City, October 2007--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 11/07 .""     ""Thank you very much for a great prep course for the GMAT. Before I took your course, I had worked through several books available in book stores to no avail. When I signed up to do your turboprep class, I found what I needed but did not realize: a guided tour of the various assessment areas. The in-class instructor was brilliant, and showed us how the different areas of the GMAT are about the same logical reasoning skills. The drilling in procedural aspects of the Gmat, especially in data sufficiency, and the hit list approach to eliminating answer choices gave me the effective tools I needed to do well on this test. I am happy to report a score of 740 on the Gmat exam which I took 10 days after your class. The score is sufficient to make me competitive at INSEAD. Your prep course works. Cheers.""           --  Matthew Hanwell , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, LONDON, November 2007--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 12/07 .""

The pre-course training is also structured to provide remedial training in areas such as algebra, statistics, and sentence correction grammar and idiom rules, and to create a diagnostic baseline for the in-class training. The pre-course training is also meant to help participants unlearn some of the bad habits that they may have picked up from reading useless GMAT prep materials that can be bought in book stores (materials such as those published by Barrons, Arco, GMAT for dummies, to name a few) or obtained from other me-too prep companies (such as Kaplan, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Veritas Prep, Testmasters, 800score.com and others) that have no proven competencies in GMAT training.

When I received the pre-course assignments that included the study guides, I was struck by the detail and depth of coverage of GMAT concepts and test-taking procedures that were included in their prep materials. My score improved to 720 after taking the MLIC class in Manhattan. I strongly recommend the MLIC GMAT prep and would like to add this caveat:  Their pre-course assignments take about 60-70 hours, not 40 hours as they had claimed.

""I took the Manhattan GMAT Online prep course for the GMAT in February 2007 and scored a 450. Subsequently, I registered in MLIC's GMAT course in December 2007 and improved my score to 660. The biggest difference I found between the Manhattan GMAT course and the MLIC Turboprep course is this: Manhattan GMAT study materials do not cover the GMAT concepts as thoroughly as MLIC study guides do. Secondly, Manhattan GMAT makes you work through the OG 10, which contains retired GMAT problems.  The actual test is very different from the types covered in the official Guide for GMAT review. What I liked best about MLIC course was their study guides and their strategies for answer selection particularly in the verbal section.

When I signed up to do your turboprep class, I found what I needed but did not realize: a guided tour of the various assessment areas. The in-class instructor was brilliant, and showed us how the different areas of the GMAT are about the same logical reasoning skills. The drilling in procedural aspects of the Gmat, especially in data sufficiency, and the hit list approach to eliminating answer choices gave me the effective tools I needed to do well on this test. I am happy to report a score of 740 on the Gmat exam which I took 10 days after your class. The score is sufficient to make me competitive at INSEAD. Your prep course works.

I am happy to report a score of 730 on the test that I took 10 days after the turboprep class in Manhattan.  Your GMAT course is the best for the following reasons:  (1) your study materials are the most thorough I have seen of any prep materials for the GMAT I have worked through; (2) The quality of in-class training was outstanding. The instructor was knowledgeable and patient; and (3) the course had a great structure, with the pre-class training assignments providing the required exposure to the concepts tested on the GMAT.

I also scored a  5.5 on the AWA section for 87th percentile ranking. Your GMAT prep course was a major factor in my success, and I must thank you for the thorough preparation you offered. I believe that I now have a competitive shot at admission to Columbia Business school.     As you are aware, I took the Veritas Elite GMAT course in Washington D.C. in Oct/Nov. 2005, and I felt that the Veritas Elite  Prep course lacked the necessary tools and methodology that could help me successfully prepare for the GMAT test.  When I first received your pre-class GMAT training files, I realized that your GMAT course was undoubtedly better than that offered by Veritas Elite! Although the majority of the information i had studied did not show up on the test, I felt prepared to deal with any problem that could have been thrown at me.  Veritas only prepared me for the most common problems which could be asked.  I also want to let you know that the incredible detail you pack into each GMAT study and training file allowed me to prepare for each GMAT section in the required depth.  Veritas Prep just put out some stuff out there and forced you to memorize concepts, hoping its crash course would provide enough of the tools necessary to solve most of the problems.   Veritas prep materials also lacked the depth and quality of training that MLIC offered. I strongly recommend MLIC GMAT prep course to anyone serious about getting a score in the 90th percentile range. Thanks again.

I took a GMAT prep course conducted by a German testpreparation company in Frankfurt and found that the level of teaching involved very simple GMAT problems, even worse than those taught in Kaplan GMAT prep or Princeton Review GMAT classes. After scoring 570 on the GMAT in my first attempt, I researched on the Internet GMAT prep courses and enrolled in the GMAT prep class offered by an American testpreparation Company, MLIC, New York. MLIC GMAT preparation course, besides offering excellent GMAT study and GMAT training materials, also reinforces the learning process with original GMAT questions. The individual attention received from dedicated instructor in the MLIC GMAT class helps one overcome his or her weakness in Mathematics and in Verbal areas of GMAT. Result: I scored 670 on the GMAT.

WHAT IS GMAT® CAT?                  GMAT® , acronym for  G raduate  M anagement  A dmission  T est, is administered by Pearson Vue® on behalf of GMAC® and is required by all  G raduate  S chools of  B usiness for admission purposes.               The GMAT, according to  GMAC                (Graduate Management Admission Council that owns the trademarks GMAT®  and GMAT CAT®, is one measure of your ability to               complete sucessfully the first year of graduate study program (MBA degree program) at a Graduate School of Business.However, effective January 2006, the paper and pencil version of the GMAT test is no longer offered anywhere in the world. GMATis              administered in a CAT(Computer Adaptive) format in which the GMAT test'adapts' the              difficulty level of GMAT questions to your GMAT-specific 'comfort level', with 'higher              difficulty level GMAT questions' carrying higher GMAT raw scores (GMAT Scaled              Scores) than do 'lower difficulty level' GMAT questions. The              GMAT tests your Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning skills, and your ability (i) to process information in context, (ii) to make necessarily true and probable interpretations of information presented, (iii) to stay focused on the specifics, and (iv) to test different scenarios for consistency of decisions. The GMAT test also is about your ability to determine whether GMAT sentences are logically, clearly, correctly, and effectively written.  The GMAT  has three              assessment areas:    AWA  (Analytical Writing Assessment)              that requires you to write Two essays, one analyzing an Issue              and the other analyzing an Argument. This first essay section on the GMAT is not 'adaptive'              and receives a separate score of between 0 and 6.   GMAT Quantitative Assessment  is the first              of the two 'adaptive' sections on the GMAT and follows the Analytical Writing section, and requires that you              answer 37 questions in problem solving and in Data Sufficiency in 75 minutes (nearly 1/4 of the questions will not be scored). Following the GMAT Quantitative section, you will be required to work on the last 'adaptive' section on              the GMAT is  Verbal              Assessment , which requires that you answer 41              questions in 75 minutes. The GMAT Verbal assessment includes three sections: GMAT Critical Reasoning, GMAT Sentence Correction, and GMAT Reading Comprehension. GMAT adaptive sections also include              experimental questions, at least 9 in GMAT Quantitative assessment and 11              in GMAT Verbal assessment. The two adaptive sections on the GMAT receive a combined             score of between 200 and 800. Most A-List Business Schools rated in the top-10 will              require a GMAT test score of at least 680 in order for you to be              competitive. (the percentile rankings corresponding to scores of between 600 and 640 have decreased in the past few years). Your best chance for success lies in your ability to              take the GMAT exam at the high difficulty level throughout and to score better than 700. The MLICETS GMAT prep              courses offer the best GMAT test training, using the  most recent and high difficulty level questions that are live on the GMAT  so that              you can competently and confidently take the GMAT test in a timed-environment, and achieve a score of better than 700.

Right from the time I received the precourse assignments, I could already see why MLIC was far superior. The training guides provided by MLIC were the best I have worked through, and the in-class instructions were the most thorough:  Veritas instructor would randomly choose a few problems from their workbooks and OG, and hurriedly show how they would be solved. After class assignments were hardly reviewed, and I had to work on my own in clueless frustration. In contrast, MLIC instructor covered all concept areas, strategies, and explained all in-class tests and home assignments. Some of the critical areas such as sequences and conditional probability were never covered in any dept in the Veritas program whereas MLIC did a great job. MLIC prep was worth the time and additional money I paid for it.          --  Name withheld on request, New York Turboprep GMAT course  ""I took your turboprep course after participating in Veritas gmat course, and found your training exponentially better. The study materials were far superior and covered the gmat sections more comprehensively, and your in-class instructions were a thousand times better than I had seen with Veritas. For example, Veritas showed a few sample problems during the in-class sessions and let me work on my own with their question bank. When I showed up in the next class, there was no review of homework problems. MLIC, on the other hand, gave all of us after-class home assignments and reviewed all of it during the following day. The instructor was a professional and was patient in helping us understand difficult concepts such as sequences and functions, which were never discussed at any length in Veritas program and which actually showed up on my test. I have no reservation in recommending MLIC gmat course.          --  KPJ, Los Angeles, CA    ""I orderd your  MLIC study guides for GMAT , and was quite pleasantly surprised by the quality and the extent of coverage of GMAT concepts. The bonus practice exercises that were supplied contained questions that were very similar to the actual GMAT problems that I faced when I took the test. My score improved from 630 to 740 after working through your study guides. Thanks, MLIC!""           --  Raman Unnikrishnan , Singapore.  ""I had recently bought the  MLIC study guides for GMAT , and was quite impressed with the quality of the contents and the meticulous coverage of GMAT fundamentals.""           --  Pradeep Sahay , Bangalore, India.  ""I took the Manhattan GMAT course before enrolling in your Turboprep course. When I worked through Manhattan GMAT program and the OG they provided, I was slightly offended and felt that I was paying nearly $1,500 for the $20 OG11 for GMAT that I could have bought at Barnes and Noble or Amazon. The OG11 has problems that were old and all problems were explained; I did not have to go through Manhattan GMAT to have them walk me through the same explanations. But I did and guess I was not thinking straight. MLIC trained me with newer types of questions and actually had me show them that I have all the concepts and procedures buttoned up. The difference is this: My score after MGMAT was 540; after MLIC, it was 690. MLIC is exceptional value for GMAT prep.          --  Rick Granja , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, New York, August 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 09/08 .""

In fact, I received the same topic for the argument essay that we discussed during the prep class, and your quantitative training in the areas of sequences, coordinate geometry, and probability were of great help when I took the test. I also found your training for the sentence correction extremely useful: I learnt that sentence correction on the GMAT is not only about grammar and idiom rules but also about rules of logic.

""I ordered your study guides before I enrolled in your GMAT prep course in Chicago. I must say that your guides far exceeded my expectations. Your sentence correction module 3 was the best I have seen, covering all bases including parallelism, logical comparisons, positioning of qualifers and modifers, etc. The anchor phrase strategy for Rc and the section about how to determine the best answer even without reading the passage were truly helpful. Your in-class training was just as I expected -- professional and very relevant. Some of the questions in your Workbooks used in the program actually showed up on the test.

All registered participants in our industry-leading, goal-driven, and skill-enhancing GMAT preparatory courses are required to complete at least 120 hours of training in three distinct phases;  PRE-CLASS TRAINING, IN-CLASS TRAINING, AND POST-CLASS TRAINING.     PRE-CLASS GMAT TRAINING   OBJECTIVE OF PRE-COURSE TRAINING  The objective of pre-course training lasting about 50 to 60 hours is to provide a highly structured approach to GMAT training, and to have the registered participants begin to review GMAT-critical concepts and procedures that are critical to taking the GMAT confidently and competently. The pre-course training is also structured to provide remedial training in areas such as algebra, statistics, and sentence correction grammar and idiom rules, and to create a diagnostic baseline for the in-class training. The pre-course training is also meant to help participants unlearn some of the bad habits that they may have picked up from reading useless GMAT prep materials that can be bought in book stores (materials such as those published by Barrons, Arco, GMAT for dummies, to name a few) or obtained from other me-too prep companies (such as Kaplan, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Veritas Prep, Testmasters, 800score.com and others) that have no proven competencies in GMAT training. The pre-course GMAT training is expected to require a commitment of about 50 to 60 hours before you attend the in-class training sessions and provides the required depth of understanding in all the GMAT concepts areas so that you can leverage the in-class training. Remember to register early so that you can receive and complete the required pre-class GMAT training. Participants who attend the in-class sessions after completing the pre-class training to the best of their ability consistently score better than 640 on the GMAT after they complete the in-class and post-class training requirements. MLIC provides  highly structured GMAT preparation, and is unrivalled by any other prep courses offered by companies such as Veritas Prep, Kaplan GMAT, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Manhattan Review, Powerscore, and others.     As soon as you register or about 4-6 weeks before the start of in-class training - whichever is later, you will receive instructions for downloading the required pre-class training files. The files are in PDF format and can be viewed using the ADOBE ACROBAT READER 6.0 or better. MLICETS pre-course training uses  the most relevant and frequently updated study and assignment materials that reflect the changes taking place in the GMAT testing on an on-going basis . The pre-class training can be completed in 50-60 hours and includes mandatory pre-training in the following GMAT assessment areas.   Review of Analytical Writing basics and completion of 5 writing tasks covering GMAT Analysis of an Issue and GMAT Analysis of an Argument.   Review of Sentence Correction Grammar and Idiom rules tested on the GMAT, and completion of a short assignment testing your understanding of the critical rules in Sentence Correction.   Review of Subject-Scope-Qualifier strategy for GMAT Critical Reasoning, and review of Illogical and Logical Arguments; Review of types of questions tested in critical reasoning and the procedures for answering them; Review of Hit List of phrases that will spell trouble in Critical Reasoning answer choices.   Review of Anchor-Phrase Strategy for GMAT Reading Comprehension, and procedures for making Logical interpretation of context-specific information relevant to the question.   Review of Quantitative Concepts in Numbers Theory, Statistics, Algebra, Geometry, and Word problems; Review of Geometry formulas; completion of concept-specific assignments in Numbers Theory, Statistics including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and weighted averages, and algebra.   The pre-class work will be evaluated by your in-class course instructor, who will use your completed work as a baseline for determining what specific additional help may need to be offered to you in order to get you up to speed. The pre-class GMAT training is a critical part of your ability to derive the most benefit out of our in-class GMAT training, and is a requirement for validating your GMAT Score Guarantee. You must attempt to complete all of the required pre-class training assignments to the best of your ability and have your instructor review your work during the in-class training phase. GMAT prep course participants who complete the pre-class training to the best of their ability usually go on to make better than 640 on the GMAT Total score when they take the GMAT exam.

The in-class training will  reinforce  conceptual and procedural understanding required to excel in the GMAT assessment areas, and identify your unique difficulties and weaknesses in order to customize your training in a small group setting. (The group size is typically between 6 and 10 people). You will be required to actively participate in several practice tests that will be reviewed for specific strategies for improving your test-taking skills and for enhancing your understanding of the concepts and procedures.

SERIOUS COACHING, NOT SEMINARS. WE TRAIN YOU, NOT JUST SHOW YOU SOME TRICKS    WHY ARE THE MLICETS GMAT TEST PREP COURSES             BETTER  than the GMAT prep courses offered by Kaplan GMAT Prep (KAPTEST), Princeton              Review, Veritas Prep, Manhattan GMAT, Manhattan Review, 800Score.com, Testmasters,Powerscore, and others? Also, VERITAS PREP's and MGMAT's deceptions uncovered.    MLIC GMAT advantage -- Best training materials, best MBA instructors,best training methodology, and the most training hours of any GMAT course out there.      For starters, we 'coach and train' you in the GMAT assessment areas, using the  latest GMAT problems , not some made-up or retired GMAT questions as Manhattan GMAT, Kaplan Prep, Veritas Prep, Princeton Review, and others do. Our goal-driven GMAT preparation courses will teach you relevant concepts and procedures required to shoot for and achieve a GMAT score of better than 700. Unlike the tutorial sessions run by Kaplan GMAT, Veritas Elite Prep , Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, and Manhattan Review, the MLICETS GMAT coaching courses will show you what it takes to achieve a GMAT score of better than 700 and make you demonstrate to your instructor that you have acquired and honed the skills in all Score-critical concept and procedural areas of GMAT, and provide customized help in your areas of weakness. We at  MLIC  do not leave it up to you to learn on your own as Kaplan GMAT, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, and other me-too courses do.  We compel you to show us that you have learned and honed the GMAT-critical procedural and conceptual skills required to get a GMAT score in the 90th percentile or better. We at MLIC are so confident that our coaching methodology is effective that we are willing to back up our training with the industry-leading GMAT Score Guarantee.    If you are not convinced that MLICETS is the best GMAT preparation option that is available to you consider this: we offer  the most GMAT training course hours  of any GMAT or GRE prep course out there: The MLICETS Turbo-Prep GMAT course              features 40 hours of pre-GMAT-course work in the GMAT assessment areas,              42 hours of in-classGMAT-coaching support, and at least 40 hours of post-GMAT-course training involving additional               practice tests, and customzied exercises - For a whopping 120 hours of serious, no-nonsense GMAT training.  Compare this to the pitiful 18 to 27 hours of useless Q&A sessions offered by Kaplan Prep (KAPTEST), Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Manhattan Review, and other me-too GMAT prep programs. Veritas Elite GMAT prep company claims to offer between 36 and 42 hours of in-class training but have been known to scale back the number of in-class hours, as it did recently in Cincinnati, OH because its part-time instructor could not show up on Day 1. Do not be stood up; be wise and be trained -- choose MLIC.     All the other GMAT prep courses, such as the              GMAT prep classes offered by Kaplan GMAT (KapTest), Princeton Review, Manhattan Review, Manhattan GMAT, Powerscore, Testmasters, and others, are              essentially  Self-study  GMAT courses : They              throw a bunch of less-than-half-decent GMAT-like books at you, show you some strategies and tricks during their in-class sessions, and ask you to work on your own for the most part. Veritas Prep, even though it claims to offer 42 hours of in-class sessions including about 3.5 hours of break during the sessions, does not require you to attend all its sessions and is, in essence, a program that relies on you to work through its prep materials on your own. MLIC GMAT Study and Training guides are the most thorough prep materials you can ever find for GMAT preparation and GMAT competency.      KAPLAN GMAT TEST PREP  courses for the GMAT run typically 18 to 24 hours and use part-time student instructors some of whom may not have taken the actual GMAT. Kaplan Prep does not use real GMAT questions but instead uses its own 'made up' questions that rely excessively on cheap tricks that do not work most of the time, if at all. Kaplan instructors have been known to give the stock reply that 'Kaplan policy does not allow to teach you those problems or answer those questions.'  The adaptive format the GMAT is not conducive to use of test-taking skills that rely on 'back-solving' and on 'tricks'. If you take away the 6 hours spent on 'practice tests' at the beginning and at the end of the 'course', the actual time spent in in-class sessions with Kaplan may not be more than 12 to 18 hours. Kaplan's ""computer lab' is a joke.  Rather than give you the CD containing the tests and having you take them at your home or office, Kaplan creates the illusion that it is actually providing value for your prep dollars by having you show up at its 'computer lab' to play with some useless tests. No one gets better by taking useless tests. MLIC actually "

A student typically chooses which tests to take depending upon  college  entrance requirements for the schools in which he or she is planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as  Achievement Tests , and until January 2005, they were known as  SAT IIs ; they are still commonly known by these names. Every test is now a one-hour timed test. Historically, the exception to the one-hour time was the writing test, which was divided into a 20-minute  essay  question and a 40-minute multiple choice section; it was discontinued after January 2005.   A student may take up to three SAT Subject Tests on any given date. Most SAT subject tests are offered on the same dates as the regular  SAT , except for the March administration. The language tests with listening are generally available only once a year, in November. A calendar of test dates and registration deadlines can be found on  The College Board 's official website ( here ).

[ edit ]   Scoring and admissions   Each individual test is scored on a scale of 200 to 800; however, some of the tests are scored on such generous curves that it is impossible to get a 200; for example, on the Mathematics Level 2 test if someone gets every question wrong, he/she gets a score of about 310 depending on the version of the test. [ 4 ]  The one and only exception was the ELPT, which was scored on a scale of 901 to 999.   Prior to the first administration of the new SAT (which includes the writing section) in March 2005, some highly selective colleges required applicants to take three SAT Subject tests, including the writing test and two other tests of the applicant's choosing, in addition to the SAT. However, with writing now a standard component of the SAT I, most selective colleges recommend applicants to submit scores for any two SAT Subject tests. Engineering schools typically require Chemistry or Physics and prefer Math Level 2. A handful of the most competitive schools, such as  Harvard University  and  Princeton University , [ 5 ]  still require three Subject tests in addition to the three sections of the SAT. It is important to consult the school's website to find out more information about Subject test requirements.   Schools also vary with regard to their SAT Subject test requirements of students submitting scores for the  ACT  in place of the SAT: some schools consider the ACT an alternative to both the SAT and some SAT Subject tests, whereas others accept the ACT but require SAT Subject tests as well. Information about a school's specific test requirements can typically be found on its official website.   The College Board will send all scores on all SAT tests taken, including Subject Tests, whenever a student requests scores be sent to a school; the student cannot select which Subject Tests to send to a given institution.   In October 2002, the College Board decided to drop the ""score choice"" option for exams. They figured that it benefited wealthier students taking the exam who could afford to take it multiple times. Score choice means that scores are not released to colleges until the student approves the score (after seeing it).  [ 6 ]   As of the March 2009 test, test takers now have the ability to choose whether or not to send scores thus reinstating the ""score choice"" option.  [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Answer sheet   The answer sheet has room for 115 answers. 1-100 are Standard Multiple choice questions and 101-115 for 'relationship analysis questions', which are only used for the Chemistry exam. No test has more than 95 questions. The biology test is the only test to use 96-100; questions 1-60 are common to both the E and M tests, in addition, the E uses 61-80, and the M uses 81-100.

When I received the pre-course assignments that included the study guides, I was struck by the detail and depth of coverage of GMAT concepts and test-taking procedures that were included in their prep materials. My score improved to 720 after taking the MLIC class in Manhattan. I strongly recommend the MLIC GMAT prep and would like to add this caveat:  Their pre-course assignments take about 60-70 hours, not 40 hours as they had claimed.

""I took the Manhattan GMAT Online prep course for the GMAT in February 2007 and scored a 450. Subsequently, I registered in MLIC's GMAT course in December 2007 and improved my score to 660. The biggest difference I found between the Manhattan GMAT course and the MLIC Turboprep course is this: Manhattan GMAT study materials do not cover the GMAT concepts as thoroughly as MLIC study guides do. Secondly, Manhattan GMAT makes you work through the OG 10, which contains retired GMAT problems.  The actual test is very different from the types covered in the official Guide for GMAT review. What I liked best about MLIC course was their study guides and their strategies for answer selection particularly in the verbal section.

When I signed up to do your turboprep class, I found what I needed but did not realize: a guided tour of the various assessment areas. The in-class instructor was brilliant, and showed us how the different areas of the GMAT are about the same logical reasoning skills. The drilling in procedural aspects of the Gmat, especially in data sufficiency, and the hit list approach to eliminating answer choices gave me the effective tools I needed to do well on this test. I am happy to report a score of 740 on the Gmat exam which I took 10 days after your class. The score is sufficient to make me competitive at INSEAD. Your prep course works.

Your GMAT course is the best for the following reasons:  (1) your study materials are the most thorough I have seen of any prep materials for the GMAT I have worked through; (2) The quality of in-class training was outstanding. The instructor was knowledgeable and patient; and (3) the course had a great structure, with the pre-class training assignments providing the required exposure to the concepts tested on the GMAT.

I also scored a  5.5 on the AWA section for 87th percentile ranking. Your GMAT prep course was a major factor in my success, and I must thank you for the thorough preparation you offered. I believe that I now have a competitive shot at admission to Columbia Business school.     As you are aware, I took the Veritas Elite GMAT course in Washington D.C. in Oct/Nov. 2005, and I felt that the Veritas Elite  Prep course lacked the necessary tools and methodology that could help me successfully prepare for the GMAT test.  When I first received your pre-class GMAT training files, I realized that your GMAT course was undoubtedly better than that offered by Veritas Elite! Although the majority of the information i had studied did not show up on the test, I felt prepared to deal with any problem that could have been thrown at me.  Veritas only prepared me for the most common problems which could be asked.  I also want to let you know that the incredible detail you pack into each GMAT study and training file allowed me to prepare for each GMAT section in the required depth.  Veritas Prep just put out some stuff out there and forced you to memorize concepts, hoping its crash course would provide enough of the tools necessary to solve most of the problems.   Veritas prep materials also lacked the depth and quality of training that MLIC offered. I strongly recommend MLIC GMAT prep course to anyone serious about getting a score in the 90th percentile range. Thanks again.

I took a GMAT prep course conducted by a German testpreparation company in Frankfurt and found that the level of teaching involved very simple GMAT problems, even worse than those taught in Kaplan GMAT prep or Princeton Review GMAT classes. After scoring 570 on the GMAT in my first attempt, I researched on the Internet GMAT prep courses and enrolled in the GMAT prep class offered by an American testpreparation Company, MLIC, New York. MLIC GMAT preparation course, besides offering excellent GMAT study and GMAT training materials, also reinforces the learning process with original GMAT questions. The individual attention received from dedicated instructor in the MLIC GMAT class helps one overcome his or her weakness in Mathematics and in Verbal areas of GMAT. Result: I scored 670 on the GMAT.

WHAT IS GMAT® CAT?                  GMAT® , acronym for  G raduate  M anagement  A dmission  T est, is administered by Pearson Vue® on behalf of GMAC® and is required by all  G raduate  S chools of  B usiness for admission purposes.               The GMAT, according to  GMAC                (Graduate Management Admission Council that owns the trademarks GMAT®  and GMAT CAT®, is one measure of your ability to               complete sucessfully the first year of graduate study program (MBA degree program) at a Graduate School of Business.However, effective January 2006, the paper and pencil version of the GMAT test is no longer offered anywhere in the world. GMATis              administered in a CAT(Computer Adaptive) format in which the GMAT test'adapts' the              difficulty level of GMAT questions to your GMAT-specific 'comfort level', with 'higher              difficulty level GMAT questions' carrying higher GMAT raw scores (GMAT Scaled              Scores) than do 'lower difficulty level' GMAT questions. The              GMAT tests your Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning skills, and your ability (i) to process information in context, (ii) to make necessarily true and probable interpretations of information presented, (iii) to stay focused on the specifics, and (iv) to test different scenarios for consistency of decisions. The GMAT test also is about your ability to determine whether GMAT sentences are logically, clearly, correctly, and effectively written.  The GMAT  has three              assessment areas:    AWA  (Analytical Writing Assessment)              that requires you to write Two essays, one analyzing an Issue              and the other analyzing an Argument. This first essay section on the GMAT is not 'adaptive'              and receives a separate score of between 0 and 6.   GMAT Quantitative Assessment  is the first              of the two 'adaptive' sections on the GMAT and follows the Analytical Writing section, and requires that you              answer 37 questions in problem solving and in Data Sufficiency in 75 minutes (nearly 1/4 of the questions will not be scored). Following the GMAT Quantitative section, you will be required to work on the last 'adaptive' section on              the GMAT is  Verbal              Assessment , which requires that you answer 41              questions in 75 minutes. The GMAT Verbal assessment includes three sections: GMAT Critical Reasoning, GMAT Sentence Correction, and GMAT Reading Comprehension. GMAT adaptive sections also include              experimental questions, at least 9 in GMAT Quantitative assessment and 11              in GMAT Verbal assessment. The two adaptive sections on the GMAT receive a combined             score of between 200 and 800. Most A-List Business Schools rated in the top-10 will              require a GMAT test score of at least 680 in order for you to be              competitive. (the percentile rankings corresponding to scores of between 600 and 640 have decreased in the past few years). Your best chance for success lies in your ability to              take the GMAT exam at the high difficulty level throughout and to score better than 700. The MLICETS GMAT prep              courses offer the best GMAT test training, using the  most recent and high difficulty level questions that are live on the GMAT  so that              you can competently and confidently take the GMAT test in a timed-environment, and achieve a score of better than 700.

Right from the time I received the precourse assignments, I could already see why MLIC was far superior. The training guides provided by MLIC were the best I have worked through, and the in-class instructions were the most thorough:  Veritas instructor would randomly choose a few problems from their workbooks and OG, and hurriedly show how they would be solved. After class assignments were hardly reviewed, and I had to work on my own in clueless frustration. In contrast, MLIC instructor covered all concept areas, strategies, and explained all in-class tests and home assignments. Some of the critical areas such as sequences and conditional probability were never covered in any dept in the Veritas program whereas MLIC did a great job. MLIC prep was worth the time and additional money I paid for it.          --  Name withheld on request, New York Turboprep GMAT course  ""I was working through some nondescript books for GMAT and was getting frustrated, not knowing what specifically I needed to know to ace this test before I registered in your course. Your course gave me a structure that was important to my learning style, and got me prepped in all the maths basics that I had initially struggled with. Your prework files (that took me 70 hours to work through against your claim of 50 hours) was nevertheless useful in giving me a brushup on the basics in maths and getting me ready for the programme. Your inclass training was equally effective. I scored an impressive 680 after your training. Cheers, MLIC.""          --  Colin Cowdrey, London Turboprep course  ""I took your turboprep course after participating in Veritas gmat course, and found your training exponentially better. The study materials were far superior and covered the gmat sections more comprehensively, and your in-class instructions were a thousand times better than I had seen with Veritas. For example, Veritas showed a few sample problems during the in-class sessions and let me work on my own with their question bank. When I showed up in the next class, there was no review of homework problems. MLIC, on the other hand, gave all of after-class home assignment and reviewed all of it during the following day. The instructor was a professional and was patient in helping us understand difficult concepts such as sequences and functions, which were never discussed at any length in Veritas program and which actually showed up on my test. I have no reservation in recommending MLIC gmat course.          --  KPJ, Los Angeles, CA    ""I orderd your  MLIC study guides for GMAT , and was quite pleasantly surprised by the quality and the extent of coverage of GMAT concepts. The bonus practice exercises that were supplied contained questions that were very similar to the actual GMAT problems that I faced when I took the test. My score improved from 630 to 740 after working through your study guides. Thanks, MLIC!""           --  Raman Unnikrishnan , Singapore.  ""I had recently bought the  MLIC study guides for GMAT , and was impressed with the quality of the contents and the meticulous coverage of GMAT fundamentals.""           --  Pradeep Sahay , Bangalore, India.   ""I took the Manhattan GMAT course before enrolling in your Turboprep course. When I worked through Manhattan GMAT program and the OG they provided, I was slightly offended and felt that I was paying nearly $1,500 for the $20 OG11 for GMAT that I could have bought at Barnes and Noble or Amazon. The OG11 has problems that were old and all problems were explained; I did not have to go through Manhattan GMAT to have them walk me through the same explanations. But I did and guess I was not thinking straight. MLIC trained me with newer types of questions and actually had me show them that I have all the concepts and procedures buttoned up. The difference is this: My score after MGMAT was 540; after MLIC, it was 690. MLIC is exceptional value for GMAT prep.          --  Rick Granja , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, New York, August 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 09/08 .""   ""Thanks to your great prep class, my score improved from 520 to 670.  In fact, I received the same topic for the argument essay that we discussed during the prep class, and your quantitative training in the areas of sequences, coordinate geometry, and probability were of great help when I took the test. I also found your training for the sentence correction extremely useful: I learnt that sentence correction on the GMAT is not only about grammar and idiom rules but also about rules of logic. MLIc prep is the best.           --  Qamar Toor  , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, New York, April 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 05/08 .""   ""I ordered your study guides before I enrolled in your GMAT prep course in Chicago. I must say that your guides far exceeded my expectations. Your sentence correction module 3 was the best I have seen, covering all bases including parallelism, logical comparisons, positioning of qualifers and modifers, etc. The anchor phrase strategy for Rc and the section about how to determine the best answer even without reading the passage were truly helpful. Your in-class training was just as I expected -- professional and very relevant. Some of the questions in your Workbooks used in the program actually showed up on the test. I owe my 700 on the GMAT to your outstanding training.           --  Elizabeth Sweeney , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, Chicago May 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 07/08 .""  ""I took the GMAT 3 times and consistently scored between 47 and 50 in the math section. My downfall was verbal section. Frustrated, I enrolled in MLIC Turboprep course in Chicago, and learned that there is a technique to reading passages and dealing with the critical reasoning section. Your training on what aspects of passages I should focus on helped me improve my verbal scaled score from 29 to 41. My total score improved from 640 to 740. Your training made the difference.

This article's  tone  or style may not be appropriate for Wikipedia . Specific concerns may be found on the  talk page . See Wikipedia's  guide to writing better articles  for suggestions.  (February 2009)       The  SAT Reasoning Test  (formerly  Scholastic Aptitude Test  and  Scholastic Assessment Test ) is a  standardized test  for  college admissions  in the  United States . The SAT is owned, published, and developed by the  College Board , a  non-profit organization  in the United States, and was once developed, published, and scored by the  Educational Testing Service  (ETS). [ 1 ]  ETS now administers the exam.   The current SAT Reasoning Test is administered in about four and one half hours and costs $50 ($71 International), excluding late fees. [ 2 ]  Since the SAT's introduction in 1901, its name and scoring has changed several times. In 2005, the test was renamed as ""SAT Reasoning Test"" with possible scores from 600 to 2400 combining test results from three 800-point sections (math, critical reading, and writing), along with other subsections scored separately.

They state that the SAT assesses how well the test takers analyze and solve problemsskills they learned in school that they will need in college. The SAT is typically taken by  high school   juniors  and  seniors . [ 3 ]  Specifically, the College Board states that use of the SAT in combination with high school grade point average (GPA) provides a better indicator of success in college than high school grades alone, as measured by college freshman  GPA . Various studies conducted over the lifetime of the SAT show a statistically significant increase in  correlation  of high school grades and freshman grades when the SAT is factored in. [ 4 ]   There are substantial differences in funding, curricula, grading, and difficulty among U.S. secondary schools due to American  federalism , local control, and the prevalence of private, distance, and  home schooled  students. SAT (and  ACT ) scores are intended to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local datasuch as course work, grades, and class rankin a national perspective. [ 5 ]   Historically, the SAT has been more popular among colleges in the coasts and the ACT more popular in the Midwest and South. There are some colleges that require the ACT to be taken for college course placement, and a few schools that do not accept the SAT at all.  [ 6 ]   Certain high  IQ  societies, like  Mensa  and the  Triple Nine Society , use scores from certain years as one of their admission tests. For instance, the  Triple Nine Society  accepts scores of 1450 on tests taken before April 1995, and scores of at least 1520 on tests taken between April 1995 and February 2005.     [ edit ]   Structure   SAT consists of three major sections: Critical  Reading ,  Mathematics , and  Writing . Each section receives a score on the scale of 200800. All scores are multiples of 10. Total scores are calculated by adding up scores of the three sections. Each major section is divided into three parts. There are 10 sub-sections, including an additional 25-minute experimental or ""equating"" section that may be in any of the three major sections. The experimental section is used to  normalize  questions for future administrations of the SAT and does not count toward the final score. The test contains 3 hours and 45 minutes of actual timed sections, [ 7 ]  although most administrations, including orientation, distribution of materials, completion of biographical sections, and eleven minutes of timed breaks, run about four and a half hours long.     [ edit ]   Critical Reading   The Critical Reading, formerly verbal, section of the SAT is made up of three scored sections, two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, with varying types of questions, including sentence completions and questions about short and long reading passages. Critical Reading sections normally begin with 5 to 8 sentence completion questions; the remainder of the questions are focused on the reading passages. Sentence completions generally test the student's  vocabulary  and understanding of sentence structure and organization by requiring the student to select one or two words that best complete a given sentence. The bulk of the Critical Reading questions is made up of questions regarding reading passages, in which students read short excerpts on social sciences, humanities, physical sciences, or personal narratives and answer questions based on the passage. Certain sections contain passages asking the student to compare two related passages; generally, these consist of short reading passages as well as longer passages. Since this is a timed test, the number of questions about each passage is proportional to the length of the passage.     [ edit ]   Mathematics   The  Mathematics  section of SAT is widely known as Quantitative Section. Mathematics section consists of three scored sections. There are two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, as follows:     One of the 25-minute sections is entirely multiple choice, with 20 questions.   The other 25-minute section contains 8 multiple choice questions and 10 grid-in questions.   The 20-minute is all multiple choice, with only 16 questions.     Notably, the SAT has done away with quantitative comparison questions on the math section, leaving only questions with straightforward  symbolic  or  numerical  answers. Since the quantitative comparison questions were well-known for their deceptive natureoften turning on the student's recognition of a single exception to a rule or patternthis choice has been equated to a philosophical shift away from ""trickery"" and toward ""straight math"" on the SAT. Also, many test experts have attributed this change, like the addition of the new writing section, to an attempt to make the SAT more like the  ACT . Indeed, there is a correlation between ACT scores and SAT scores. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Writing          Page 1 of an SAT essay. This student received a 7/12 from two judges, one giving 3/6 and the other giving 4/6.              Page 2 of the same essay.       The writing section of the SAT, based on but not directly comparable to the old SAT II subject test in writing, includes multiple choice questions and a brief essay. The essay subscore contributes about 30% towards the total writing score, with the multiple choice questions contributing 70%. This section was implemented in March 2005 following complaints from colleges about the lack of uniform examples of a student's writing ability.   The multiple choice questions include error identification questions, sentence improvement questions, and paragraph improvement questions. Error identification and sentence improvement questions test the student's knowledge of grammar, presenting an awkward or grammatically incorrect sentence; in the error identification section, the student must locate the word producing the source of the error or indicate that the sentence has no error, while the sentence improvement section requires the student to select an acceptable fix to the awkward sentence. The paragraph improvement questions test the student's understanding of logical organization of ideas, presenting a poorly written student essay and asking a series of questions as to what changes might be made to best improve it.   The essay section, which is always administered as the first section of the test, is 25 minutes long. All essays must be in response to a given prompt. The prompts are broad and often philosophical and are designed to be accessible to students regardless of their educational and social backgrounds. For instance, test takers may be asked to expound on such ideas as their opinion on the value of work in human life or whether technological change also carries negative consequences to those who benefit from it. No particular essay structure is required, and the College Board accepts examples ""taken from [the student's] reading, studies, experience, or observations."" Two trained readers assign each essay a score between 1 and 6, where a score of 0 is reserved for essays that are blank, off-topic, non-English, not written with a Number 2 pencil, or considered illegible after several attempts at reading. The scores are summed to produce a final score from 2 to 12 (or 0). If the two readers' scores differ by more than one point, then a senior third reader decides. The average time each reader/grader spends on each essay is less than 3 minutes.  [ 10 ]   Despite the  College Board 's claims that the SAT Essay is a nonbiased assessment of a student's writing ability, many different claims of bias have surfaced, including claims that readers give higher points to those who write in cursive, writers who write about personal experiences are less likely to get higher scores, and that topics favor the higher social classes. [ citation needed ]  The College Board strictly denies any forms of bias on all portions of the SAT Reasoning Exam. In addition, essays with factual errors were not penalized for the errors.   In March 2004 Dr. Les Perelman analyzed 15 scored sample essays contained in the College Board's Score Write book and found that 90% of essays that contained more than 400 words got the highest score of 12 and that the essays with 100 words or fewer got the lowest grade of 1. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Questions   Most of the questions on the SAT are  multiple choice ; all multiple-choice questions have five answer choices, one of which is correct. The questions of each section of the same type are generally ordered by difficulty. However, an important exception exists: Questions that follow the long and short reading passages are organized chronologically, rather than by difficulty. Ten of the questions in one of the math sub-sections are not multiple choice. They instead require the test taker to bubble in a number in a four-column grid.   The questions are weighted equally. For each correct answer, one raw point is added. For each incorrect answer one-fourth of a point is deducted. [ 11 ]  No points are deducted for incorrect math grid-in questions. This ensures that a student's  mathematically expected gain  from guessing is zero. The final score is derived from the raw score; the precise conversion chart varies between test administrations.   The SAT therefore recommends only making educated guesses, that is, when the test taker can eliminate at least one answer he or she thinks is wrong. Without eliminating any answers one's probability of answering correctly is 20%. Eliminating one wrong answer increases this probability to 25%; two, a 33.3% probability; three, a 50% probability of choosing the correct answer and thus earning the full point for the question.

The test is typically offered on the first Saturday of the month for the November, December, May, and June administrations. In other countries, the SAT is offered on the same dates as in the  United States  except for the first spring test date (i.e., March or April), which is not offered. In 2006, the test was taken 1,465,744 times. [ 12 ]   Candidates may either take the SAT Reasoning Test or up to three  SAT Subject Tests  on any given test date, except the first spring test date, when only the SAT Reasoning Test is offered. Candidates wishing to take the test may register online at the College Board's website, by mail, or by telephone, at least three weeks before the test date.   The SAT Subject Tests are all given in one large book on test day. Therefore, it is actually immaterial which tests, and how many, the student signs up for; with the possible exception of the language tests with listening, the student may change his or her mind and take  any  tests, regardless of his or her initial sign-ups. Students who choose to take more subject tests than they signed up for will later be billed by College Board for the additional tests and their scores will be withheld until the bill is paid. Students who choose to take fewer subject tests than they signed up for are not eligible for a refund.   The SAT Reasoning Test costs $45 ($71 International). For the Subject tests, students pay a $20 Basic Registration Fee and $9 per test (except for language tests with listening, which cost $20 each). [ 2 ]  The College Board makes fee waivers available for low income students. Additional fees apply for late registration, standby testing, registration changes, scores by telephone, and extra score reports (beyond the four provided for free).   Candidates whose religious beliefs prevent them from taking the test on a Saturday may request to take the test on the following Sunday, except for the October test date in which the Sunday test date is eight days after the main test offering. Such requests must be made at the time of registration and are subject to denial.   Students with verifiable disabilities, including physical and learning disabilities, are eligible to take the SAT with accommodations. The standard time increase for students requiring additional time due to learning disabilities is 50%.     [ edit ]   Raw scores, scaled scores, and percentiles   Students receive their online score reports approximately three weeks after test administration (six weeks for mailed, paper scores), with each section graded on a scale of 200800 and two sub scores for the writing section: the essay score and the multiple choice sub score. In addition to their score, students receive their  percentile  (the percentage of other test takers with lower scores). The raw score, or the number of points gained from correct answers and lost from incorrect answers (ranges from just under 50 to just under 60, depending upon the test), is also included. [ 13 ]  Students may also receive, for an additional fee, the Question and Answer Service, which provides the student's answer, the correct answer to each question, and online resources explaining each question.   The corresponding percentile of each scaled score varies from test to testfor example, in 2003, a scaled score of 800 in both sections of the SAT Reasoning Test corresponded to a percentile of 99.9, while a scaled score of 800 in the SAT Physics Test corresponded to the 94th percentile. The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are because of the content of the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to intensive study (often in the form of an  AP , which is relatively more difficult), and only those who know they will perform well tend to take these tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores.   The percentiles that various SAT scores for college-bound seniors correspond to are summarized in the following chart: [ 14 ] [ 12 ]       Percentile   Score, 1600 Scale  (official, 2006)   Score, 2400 Scale  (official, 2006)       99.93/99.98*   1600   2400       99+   1540   2290       99   1480   2200       98   1450   2140       97   1420   2100       88   1380   1900       83   1280   1800       78   1200   1770       72   1150   1700       61   1090   1600       48   1010   1500       36   950   1400       15   810   1200       4   670   1010       1   520   790       * The percentile of the perfect score was 99.98 on the 2400 scale and 99.93 on the 1600 scale.       The older SAT (before 1995) had a very high ceiling. In any given year, only seven of the million test-takers scored above 1580. A score above 1580 was equivalent to the 99.9995 percentile.

Although there is no official conversion chart between the SAT and its biggest rival, the  ACT , the College Board released an unofficial chart based on results from 103,525 test takers who took both tests between October 1994 and December 1996  here ; however, both tests have changed since then. Several colleges have also issued their own charts. The following is based on the University of California's conversion chart.

[ edit ]   1901 test   The College Board began on June 17, 1901, when 973 students took its first test, across 67 locations in the United States, and two in Europe. Although those taking the test came from a variety of backgrounds, approximately one third were from  New York ,  New Jersey , or  Pennsylvania . The majority of those taking the test were from private schools, academies, or endowed schools. About 60% of those taking the test applied to  Columbia University . The test contained sections on English,  French ,  German ,  Latin ,  Greek , history, mathematics,  chemistry , and  physics . The test was not multiple choice, but instead was evaluated based on essay responses as ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""doubtful,"" ""poor,"" or ""very poor.""  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   1926 test   The first administration of the SAT occurred on June 23, 1926, when it was known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of  definitions ,  arithmetic , classification, artificial language,  antonyms , number series,  analogies ,  logical inference , and paragraph reading. It was administered to over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to  Yale University  and  Smith College  respectively.  [ 20 ]  The test was paced rather quickly, test-takers being given only a little over 90 minutes to answer 315 questions. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1928 and 1929 tests   In 1928 the number of verbal sections was reduced to 7, and the time limit was increased to slightly under two hours. In 1929 the number of sections was again reduced, this time to 6. These changes in part loosened time constraints on test-takers. Math was eliminated entirely for these tests, instead focusing only on verbal ability. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1930 test and 1936 changes   In 1930 the SAT was first split into the verbal and math sections, a structure that would continue through 2004. The verbal section of the 1930 test covered a more narrow range on content than its predecessors, examining only antonyms, double definitions (somewhat similar to sentence completions), and paragraph reading. In 1936, analogies were re-added. Between 1936 and 1946, students had between 80 and 115 minutes to answer 250 verbal questions (over a third of which were on antonyms). The mathematics test introduced in 1930 contained 100 free response questions to be answered in 80 minutes, and focused primarily on speed. From 1936 to 1941, like the 1928 and 1929 tests, the mathematics section was eliminated entirely. When the mathematics portion of the test was re-added in 1942, it consisted of multiple choice questions. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1946 test and associated changes   Paragraph reading was eliminated from the verbal portion of the SAT in 1946, and replaced with reading comprehension, and ""double definition"" questions were replaced with sentence completions. Between 1946 and 1957 students were given 90 to 100 minutes to complete 107 to 170 verbal questions. Starting in 1958 time limits became more stable, and for 17 years, until 1975, students had 75 minutes to answer 90 questions. In 1959 questions on data sufficiency were introduced to the mathematics section, and then replaced with quantitative comparisons in 1974. In 1974 both verbal and math sections were reduced from 75 minutes to 60 minutes each, with changes in test composition compensating for the decreased time. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1980 test and associated changes   The inclusion of the ""Strivers"" Score study was implemented. This study was introduced by The Educational Testing Service, which administers the SAT, and has been conducting research on how to make it easier for minorities and individuals who suffer from social and economic barriers. The original ""Strivers"" project, which was in the research phase from 19801994, awarded special ""Striver"" status to test-takers who scored 200 points higher than expected for their race, gender and income level. The belief was that this would give minorities a better chance at being accepted in to a college of higher standard, i.e. an Ivy League school. In 1992, the Strivers Project was leaked to the public; as a result the Strivers Project was terminated in 1993. After Federal Courts heard arguments from the ACLU, NAACP and the Educational Testing Service, the courts ordered the study to alter its data collection process, stating that only the age, race and zip code could be used to determine the test-takers eligibility for ""Strivers"" points. These changes were introduced to the SAT effective in 1994.     [ edit ]   1994 changes   In 1994 the verbal section received a dramatic change in focus. Among these changes were the removal of  antonym  questions, and an increased focus on passage reading. The mathematics section also saw a dramatic change in 1994, thanks in part to pressure from the  National Council of Teachers of Mathematics . For the first time since 1935, the SAT asked some non-multiple choice questions, instead requiring students to supply the answers. 1994 also saw the introduction of calculators into the mathematics section for the first time in the test's history. The mathematics section introduced concepts of probability, slope, elementary statistics, counting problems, median and mode. [ 19 ]   The average score on the 1994 modification of the SAT I was usually around 1000 (500 on the verbal, 500 on the math). The most selective schools in the United States (for example, those in the  Ivy League ) typically had SAT averages exceeding 1400 on the old test.     [ edit ]   2002 changes - Score Choice   In October 2002, the College Board dropped the Score Choice Option. Under this option, scores were not released to colleges until the student saw and approved of the score. [ 21 ]  The reasoning was that the option benefited wealthier students who could afford to take it multiple times. The College Board has since decided to re-implement Score Choice in the spring of 2009. It is described as optional, and it is not clear if the reports sent will indicate whether or not this student has opted-in or not. A number of highly selective colleges and universities have announced they will require applicants to submit all scores, including  Harvard ,  Cornell ,  Yale  and  Stanford . Others, such as  MIT , have embraced Score Choice.     [ edit ]   2005 changes   In 2005, the test was changed again, largely in response to criticism by the  University of California system . [ 22 ]  Because of issues concerning ambiguous questions, especially  analogies , certain types of questions were eliminated (the analogies from the verbal and quantitative comparisons from the Math section). The test was made marginally harder, as a corrective to the rising number of perfect scores. A new writing section, with an essay, based on the former SAT II Writing Subject Test, was added, in part to increase the chances of closing the opening gap between the highest and midrange scores. Other factors included the desire to test the writing ability of each student in a personal manner; hence the essay. The New SAT (known as the SAT Reasoning Test) was first offered on March 12, 2005, after the last administration of the ""old"" SAT in January 2005. The Mathematics section was expanded to cover three years of high school mathematics. The Verbal section's name was changed to the Critical Reading section.     [ edit ]   2008 changes   In 2008, or rather for the late 2008, 2009 testing, a new variable came into play. Before, it was required for applicants to most colleges to submit all scores with some colleges who embraced Score Choice to allow their students to do so. However, this year, an initiative to make Score Choice universal began, with some opposition from colleges desiring to maintain score report practices. While students theoretically now have the choice to submit their best score (in theory one could send any score they wish to send) to the college of their choice, some popular colleges and universities, such as Cornell, ask that students send all test scores. [ 23 ]  This had led the College Board to display on their web site which colleges agree with or dislike Score Choice, with continued claims that students will still never have scores submitted against their will.     [ edit ]   Name changes and recentered scores   Although originally standing for ""Scholastic Aptitude Test"" [ 24 ] , in 1990, because of uncertainty about the SAT's ability to function as an  intelligence test , the name was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test. In 1993 the name was changed to SAT I: Reasoning Test (with the  letters not standing for anything ) to distinguish it from the  SAT II: Subject Tests [ 24 ] . In 2004, the roman numerals on both tests were dropped, and the SAT I renamed the SAT Reasoning Test [ 24 ] . The scoring categories are now the following: Critical Reading (comparable to some of the Verbal portions of the old SAT I), Mathematics, and Writing. The writing section now includes an essay, whose score is involved in computing the overall score for the Writing section, as well as grammar sections (also comparable to some Verbal portions of the previous SAT).   The test scoring was initially scaled to make 500 the mean score on each section with a  standard deviation  of 100. [ 25 ]  As the test grew more popular and more students from less rigorous schools began taking the test, the average dropped to about 428 Verbal and 478 Math. The SAT was ""recentered"" in 1995, and the average ""new"" score became again close to 500. Scores awarded after 1994 and before October 2001 are officially reported with an ""R"" (e.g. 1260R) to reflect this change. Old scores may be recentered to compare to 1995 to present scores by using official College Board tables [ 26 ]  , which in the middle ranges add about 70 points to Verbal and 20 or 30 points to Math. In other words, current students have a 100 (70 plus 30) point advantage over their parents.     [ edit ]   Controversy     [ edit ]   Scoring problems of October 2005 tests   In March 2006, it was announced that a small percentage of the SATs taken in October 2005 had been scored incorrectly due to the test papers being moist and not scanning properly, and that some students had received substantially erroneous scores. The College Board announced they would change the scores for the students who were given a lower score than they earned, but at this point many of those students had already applied to colleges using their original scores. The College Board decided not to change the scores for the students who were given a higher score than they earned. A lawsuit was filed in 2005 by about 4,400 students who received an incorrect low score on the SAT. The class-action suit was settled in August 2007 when The College Board and another company that administers the college-admissions test announced they would pay $2.85 million to over 4,000 students. Under the agreement each student can either elect to receive $275 or submit a claim for more money if he or she feels the damage was even greater. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Criticism     [ edit ]   Bias                        As depicted above, SAT scores vary according to race, income, and parental educational background.       A famous example of alleged bias in the SAT I was the  oarsman - regatta  analogy question. [ 28 ]  The object of the question was to find the pair of terms that have the relationship most similar to the relationship between ""runner"" and ""marathon."" The correct answer was ""oarsman"" and ""regatta."" Choice of the correct answer presupposed students' familiarity with a sport popular with the wealthy, and so upon their knowledge of its structure and terminology. Fifty-three percent (53%) of white students - who in greater numbers come from higher income households - correctly answered the question, while only 22% of black students - who disproportionately came from lower income households - also scored correctly. [ 29 ]  Analogy questions have since been replaced by short reading passages.     [ edit ]   Dropping SAT   A growing number of  liberal arts colleges  have responded to this criticism by joining the  SAT optional movement . These colleges do not require the SAT for admission.   In a 2001 speech to the  American Council on Education ,  Richard C. Atkinson , then president of the  University of California , urged dropping the SAT Reasoning Test as a college admissions requirement:     ""Anyone involved in education should be concerned about how overemphasis on the SAT is distorting educational priorities and practices, how the test is perceived by many as unfair, and how it can have a devastating impact on the self-esteem and aspirations of young students. There is widespread agreement that overemphasis on the SAT harms American education."" [ 30 ]     In response to threats by the University of California to drop the SAT as an admission requirement, the College Entrance Examination Board announced the restructuring of the SAT, to take effect in March 2005, as detailed above.     [ edit ]   Essay   In 2005,  MIT  Writing Director  Les Perelman  plotted essay length versus essay score on the new SAT from released essays and found a high correlation between them. After studying 23 graded essays he found that the longer the essay was the higher the score. He also discovered that several of these essays were full of factual errors. However, the official SAT guide for scorers state that the essays should be scored according to their quality of writing and not factual accuracy. The National Council of Teachers of English also criticize the 25-minute writing section of the test, arguing that the basic principles of writing encourage the revision of written material several times. They say that the amount of time allowed for the test pushes schools to develop a formulaic system of writing. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Test preparation   Many companies and organizations offer test preparation in the form of books, classes, online courses, tutoring and only recently, board games [ 32 ] . Large organizations include  Kaplan  and  the Princeton Review . Some have criticized the SAT because preparation often can lead to much higher scores, but some have embraced the opportunity to improve their scores.

Quantitative Section (Math)     The GMAT prep classes cover topics in Arithmetic, Algebra and Geometry. Topics covered include number systems, Geometry, Permutation & Combination and Probability. On the quantitative (Math) section, the course lays emphasis on Data Sufficiency questions, which account for about a third of the questions in the Quant section.       Over 20 chapters are covered in the theory classes. In each of the topics, in addition to covering basic concepts, questions representative of those that appear in the GMAT test are solved. Shortcuts to select problems are taught to save you those precious minutes.     Comprehensive study material is provided for each of the topics and includes introduction to concepts on the topic, forumulae if any relevant to the topic, adequate solved examples with shortcuts wherever applicable, exercise problems with explanatory answers and objective type multiple choice speed tests.      Verbal Section (English)    4GMAT's GMAT Preparation classes cover basics in English Grammar with emphasis on spotting common errors in English Usage that typically appear in the GMAT test. Subsequently, the GMAT prep course focuses on mastering the basics of logical argument construct and the course material provides adequate exercises to improve your comfort level in the critical reasoning part of the Verbal section.     The training program includes the basic dos and don'ts in Reading Comprehension and offers plenty of testworthy examples to give adequate practice in the RC section.

The Math Lesson Books contain 1800 plus questions in total and will act as an excellent training aid for students.

clueweb09-enwp03-16-06944	"                     SAT Subject Tests          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Sat 2 )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search            The  SAT Subject Tests  is the collective name for 20  multiple choice   standardized tests  given on individual subjects. A student typically chooses which tests to take depending upon  college  entrance requirements for the schools in which he or she is planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as  Achievement Tests , and until January 2005, they were known as  SAT IIs ; they are still commonly known by these names. Every test is now a one-hour timed test. Historically, the exception to the one-hour time was the writing test, which was divided into a 20-minute  essay  question and a 40-minute multiple choice section; it was discontinued after January 2005.   A student may take up to three SAT Subject Tests on any given date. Most SAT subject tests are offered on the same dates as the regular  SAT , except for the March administration. The language tests with listening are generally available only once a year, in November. A calendar of test dates and registration deadlines can be found on  The College Board 's official website ( here ).

[ edit ]   Scoring and admissions   Each individual test is scored on a scale of 200 to 800; however, some of the tests are scored on such generous curves that it is impossible to get a 200; for example, on the Mathematics Level 2 test if someone gets every question wrong, he/she gets a score of about 310 depending on the version of the test. [ 4 ]  The one and only exception was the ELPT, which was scored on a scale of 901 to 999.   Prior to the first administration of the new SAT (which includes the writing section) in March 2005, some highly selective colleges required applicants to take three SAT Subject tests, including the writing test and two other tests of the applicant's choosing, in addition to the SAT. However, with writing now a standard component of the SAT I, most selective colleges recommend applicants to submit scores for any two SAT Subject tests. Engineering schools typically require Chemistry or Physics and prefer Math Level 2. A handful of the most competitive schools, such as  Harvard University  and  Princeton University , [ 5 ]  still require three Subject tests in addition to the three sections of the SAT. It is important to consult the school's website to find out more information about Subject test requirements.   Schools also vary with regard to their SAT Subject test requirements of students submitting scores for the  ACT  in place of the SAT: some schools consider the ACT an alternative to both the SAT and some SAT Subject tests, whereas others accept the ACT but require SAT Subject tests as well. Information about a school's specific test requirements can typically be found on its official website.   The College Board will send all scores on all SAT tests taken, including Subject Tests, whenever a student requests scores be sent to a school; the student cannot select which Subject Tests to send to a given institution.   In October 2002, the College Board decided to drop the ""score choice"" option for exams. They figured that it benefited wealthier students taking the exam who could afford to take it multiple times. Score choice means that scores are not released to colleges until the student approves the score (after seeing it).  [ 6 ]   As of the March 2009 test, test takers now have the ability to choose whether or not to send scores thus reinstating the ""score choice"" option.  [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Answer sheet   The answer sheet has room for 115 answers. 1-100 are Standard Multiple choice questions and 101-115 for 'relationship analysis questions', which are only used for the Chemistry exam. No test has more than 95 questions. The biology test is the only test to use 96-100; questions 1-60 are common to both the E and M tests, in addition, the E uses 61-80, and the M uses 81-100.

Though enrolling at any                                 of these GMAT prep courses does not guarantee                                 success in the exam, it is an effective way of                                 preparing for the  GMAT                                 test . While you are preparing for taking the                                 GMAT test, these GMAT prep courses can significantly                                 help you with high quality study materials that                                 are prepared by experts. These GMAT prep courses                                 keep you focused towards your goal and prepare                                 you for the  GMAT                                 test  through step-by-step procedures under                                 the strict guidance of the faculties. Besides                                 helping with the study materials and classroom                                 teaching, the preparatory centres also conduct                                 mock  GMAT                                 tests  that help the student to identify the                                 areas of their weakness that lets them give extra                                 effort to overcome the weakness.                                 Another benefit of the mock test                                 is that it prepares an aspiring student mentally                                 to take the GMAT that is altogether a different                                 type of test. Being a  computer                                 based test  and for so many other reasons GMAT                                 remains a tough exam for the students of India,                                 as they otherwise do not face a test like this.                                 So, the  mock                                 tests  play an important role of getting the                                 students familiar with the content as well as                                 pattern of the test that eventually helps the                                 students to overcome the psychological pressure                                 that is associated with the  GMAT                                 test .                                 Now these are the benefits of                                 the prep courses and like any other thing in life,                                 the preparatory classes do have its share of demerits                                 as well. The primary problem that the students                                 face with these prep classes is that of time.                                 These  prep                                 classes  demand a lot of time that cut down                                 heavily on the study time of the students. Moreover,                                 institutions that are based in large metropolitan                                 cities like Delhi and Mumbai organize most of                                 these classes and hence students from smaller                                 cities and towns find it difficult to attend them.

clueweb09-enwp03-14-03339	"                     SAT Subject Tests          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  SATII Math )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search            The  SAT Subject Tests  is the collective name for 20  multiple choice   standardized tests  given on individual subjects. A student typically chooses which tests to take depending upon  college  entrance requirements for the schools in which he or she is planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as  Achievement Tests , and until January 2005, they were known as  SAT IIs ; they are still commonly known by these names. Every test is now a one-hour timed test. Historically, the exception to the one-hour time was the writing test, which was divided into a 20-minute  essay  question and a 40-minute multiple choice section; it was discontinued after January 2005.   A student may take up to three SAT Subject Tests on any given date. Most SAT subject tests are offered on the same dates as the regular  SAT , except for the March administration. The language tests with listening are generally available only once a year, in November. A calendar of test dates and registration deadlines can be found on  The College Board 's official website ( here ).

[ edit ]   Scoring and admissions   Each individual test is scored on a scale of 200 to 800; however, some of the tests are scored on such generous curves that it is impossible to get a 200; for example, on the Mathematics Level 2 test if someone gets every question wrong, he/she gets a score of about 310 depending on the version of the test. [ 4 ]  The one and only exception was the ELPT, which was scored on a scale of 901 to 999.   Prior to the first administration of the new SAT (which includes the writing section) in March 2005, some highly selective colleges required applicants to take three SAT Subject tests, including the writing test and two other tests of the applicant's choosing, in addition to the SAT. However, with writing now a standard component of the SAT I, most selective colleges recommend applicants to submit scores for any two SAT Subject tests. Engineering schools typically require Chemistry or Physics and prefer Math Level 2. A handful of the most competitive schools, such as  Harvard University  and  Princeton University , [ 5 ]  still require three Subject tests in addition to the three sections of the SAT. It is important to consult the school's website to find out more information about Subject test requirements.   Schools also vary with regard to their SAT Subject test requirements of students submitting scores for the  ACT  in place of the SAT: some schools consider the ACT an alternative to both the SAT and some SAT Subject tests, whereas others accept the ACT but require SAT Subject tests as well. Information about a school's specific test requirements can typically be found on its official website.   The College Board will send all scores on all SAT tests taken, including Subject Tests, whenever a student requests scores be sent to a school; the student cannot select which Subject Tests to send to a given institution.   In October 2002, the College Board decided to drop the ""score choice"" option for exams. They figured that it benefited wealthier students taking the exam who could afford to take it multiple times. Score choice means that scores are not released to colleges until the student approves the score (after seeing it).  [ 6 ]   As of the March 2009 test, test takers now have the ability to choose whether or not to send scores thus reinstating the ""score choice"" option.  [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Answer sheet   The answer sheet has room for 115 answers. 1-100 are Standard Multiple choice questions and 101-115 for 'relationship analysis questions', which are only used for the Chemistry exam. No test has more than 95 questions. The biology test is the only test to use 96-100; questions 1-60 are common to both the E and M tests, in addition, the E uses 61-80, and the M uses 81-100.

It's one of the two 800 pound gorillas among all college tests. Colleges and universities rely on it as an accurate predictor of how well a student will do at college level academics. Given seven times a year all over the country, the SAT plays a huge part in helping to determine what college millions of people will attend, and what kind of future they'll have. If there were ever a test you need to do well on, it's the SAT.    It takes nearly four hours to complete, and is broken up into three main sections-Critical Reading, Math, and Writing. The writing portion of the SAT requires a written essay, and a few of the questions on the math portion are grid in types, but the rest of the test consists of multiple choice questions, offering five different possible answers for each question. The highest possible score in each part is 800; a perfect SAT score is 2400. The critical reading section measures abilities in reading comprehension, sentence completion, and the ability to read critically. It last 70 minutes. The math section also last 70 minutes and measures abilities in geometry, algebra, statistics, probability, and data analysis. In the writing section you'll have 35 minutes to answer questions about grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, and then you'll have 25 minutes to demonstrate your writing skills by writing an essay on an assigned topic.  You do have the option of canceling your score if you feel your test didn't go well, but you must cancel all the test, not just parts of it. Scores are available online about two weeks after the test, they're mailed out about two weeks after that. There's a lot of pressure riding on the results of your SAT, and it's hard to put that out of your mind during the test. Preparation and study are imperative before walking into the examination room.

clueweb09-en0006-99-20947	"                                                                      Achieving Faculty Diversity: Debunking the Myths    Efforts to diversify the faculty continue to be one of the least successful components of the campus diversity agenda. The labor market for all those seeking faculty positions remains extremely tight. Critics of campus efforts to diversify faculty have suggested that people of color are in high demand and therefore the subject of competitive bidding wars. Further, they suggest that being a white heterosexual male may actually be a hindrance to finding an academic position in today's climate.    These claims and other myths about the labor market for women and people of color seeking faculty positions are refuted in a recent Association of American Colleges and Universities report by Daryl Smith,  Achieving Faculty Diversity: Debunking the Myths .    The study examined the employment experiences of 393 white men and women and minority Ph.D's who were recipients of prestigious Ford, Mellon, and Spencer fellowships. The study found that claims that faculty of color are in great demand and the recipients of bidding wars are grossly exaggerated. The difficulties of the current faculty job market and limited options diminished career opportunities for all of these highly select doctoral recipients. This research is particularly important because one might expect that the pool of doctoral recipients studied should have had the best experiences in the job market because they had been previously ""labeled"" as particularly successful and elite.    The pool studied can be seen as an elite group because of their status as prestigious fellowship recipients, but they also attended relatively prestigious graduate schools. Ninety-three percent of the participants attended Research I institutions. Overwhelmingly, these were the elite Research institutions such as the Ivy League schools, Stanford University, the University of California–Berkeley, the University of Michigan, and the University of California–Los Angeles. Indeed, almost one-third got their doctorates at Ivy League institutions.    Even among this elite group, only 11 percent of scholars of color were actually actively sought after by several institutions simultaneously, which means 89 percent of scholars of color were not the subject of competitive bidding wars as frequently ascribed. Twenty-four percent of white men, 27 percent of white women, 26 percent of men of color, and 25 percent of women of color were among those in the study who had the most job options. This suggests a rather even distribution of access between men and women and across race, and again undercuts widely circulated beliefs that if you are a person of color--especially a woman of color--you have a double advantage on the job market.          The study found that claims that faculty of color are in great demand and the recipients of bidding wars are grossly exaggerated.            Contradicting the notion that campuses are so focused on diversifying faculty that heterosexual white males have no chance, white men had a variety of experiences--from the 20 percent who were underutilized to the 24 percent who had a favorable result in the labor market. Interestingly, white men who had expertise related to diversity had a significant advantage on the job market.    While focusing primarily on experiences with the job search itself, the study did confirm that the climate for faculty of color in institutions remains uncomfortable and difficult, regardless of the circumstances under which the individual was hired (see pages 5 and 6).    Authors conclude the study by noting that, ""There are some faculty who are sought out and who negotiate their positions, but there are also many more for whom a single offer [or none at all] was typical....What is imperative is that institutions must not fall back on the myths--they are untrue, they are damaging, and they misname the problem and the potential solutions.""    To order  Achieving Faculty Diversity , contact AAC&U publications desk, 202/387-3760; ( pub_desk@aacu.nw.dc.us ).      Most new research--particularly research that debunks myths or challenges common perceptions--will have news value, especially if it relates to an issue that is currently in the news. If you develop new data on ""hot"" issues like faculty diversity, ethnic housing, or curricular change, consider seeking help from your public information office to issue a news release, book yourself on a talk show, or set up a meeting with a columnist or editorial writer. If that doesn't work, keep an eye out for an article that will present an opportunity for you to write a letter-to-the-editor or an op/ed piece to share the new research. Be pro-active with new data; it gives you more influence in shaping (rather than just responding to) news stories.      back to top              "

[ edit ]   Scoring and admissions   Each individual test is scored on a scale of 200 to 800; however, some of the tests are scored on such generous curves that it is impossible to get a 200; for example, on the Mathematics Level 2 test if someone gets every question wrong, he/she gets a score of about 310 depending on the version of the test. [ 4 ]  The one and only exception was the ELPT, which was scored on a scale of 901 to 999.   Prior to the first administration of the new SAT (which includes the writing section) in March 2005, some highly selective colleges required applicants to take three SAT Subject tests, including the writing test and two other tests of the applicant's choosing, in addition to the SAT. However, with writing now a standard component of the SAT I, most selective colleges recommend applicants to submit scores for any two SAT Subject tests. Engineering schools typically require Chemistry or Physics and prefer Math Level 2. A handful of the most competitive schools, such as  Harvard University  and  Princeton University , [ 5 ]  still require three Subject tests in addition to the three sections of the SAT. It is important to consult the school's website to find out more information about Subject test requirements.   Schools also vary with regard to their SAT Subject test requirements of students submitting scores for the  ACT  in place of the SAT: some schools consider the ACT an alternative to both the SAT and some SAT Subject tests, whereas others accept the ACT but require SAT Subject tests as well. Information about a school's specific test requirements can typically be found on its official website.   The College Board will send all scores on all SAT tests taken, including Subject Tests, whenever a student requests scores be sent to a school; the student cannot select which Subject Tests to send to a given institution.   In October 2002, the College Board decided to drop the ""score choice"" option for exams. They figured that it benefited wealthier students taking the exam who could afford to take it multiple times. Score choice means that scores are not released to colleges until the student approves the score (after seeing it).  [ 6 ]   As of the March 2009 test, test takers now have the ability to choose whether or not to send scores thus reinstating the ""score choice"" option.  [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Answer sheet   The answer sheet has room for 115 answers. 1-100 are Standard Multiple choice questions and 101-115 for 'relationship analysis questions', which are only used for the Chemistry exam. No test has more than 95 questions. The biology test is the only test to use 96-100; questions 1-60 are common to both the E and M tests, in addition, the E uses 61-80, and the M uses 81-100.

Colleges and universities across the country are transforming their curricula to correct past exclusions; to better prepare students for increasingly complex and diverse communities and workplaces; and to provide students with the most current and intellectually comprehensive understanding of history, culture, and society.    The contours of this far-reaching curriculum transformation remain partially hidden, obscured both by the extraordinary diversity of higher education itself and by a public dialogue still framed in terms of ""culture wars.""    This public narrative too often misses the real power and excitement of what is happening in curricula and classrooms across the country. In every part of the United States and in every kind of institution, faculty members are discussing what it would take to educate students for a world that respects distinctive traditions and also to create new forms of inclusion, equality, and connection. This search for a richer development of American pluralism has led to new energy in general education courses, to dialogues about diversity in almost every field, and to new links between the curriculum and the community. The debates on American pluralism have become civic dialogues about the learning we need in a diverse democracy.    Diversity Digest  has reviewed curricular reforms at more than one hundred colleges and universities around the country. We report here on major themes we found in new campus diversity requirements and the courses developed to meet them.    Addressing Diversity Both at Home and Abroad    For more than a decade, campuses have been revising more traditional ""Western Civilization"" courses to better account for global realities and cross-cultural interactions. Initially, far fewer campuses were developing required courses that addressed diversity in the U.S. It may have seemed easier to deal with cultural diversity internationally than to grapple with domestic diversity realities still resonating with tension in our own backyards.    Today, many more campuses are infusing their curricula with domestic diversity issues. Some institutions are also beginning to make more explicit the interconnections among the dynamics of pluralism in the U.S. and those globally. Many campuses that once had requirements that allowed students to take a class in either international or domestic diversity, now believe students need knowledge both about non-Western cultures outside the U.S. and diversity issues in the U.S. and are therefore instituting requirements that address both goals.    Moving from ""Identity"" to Discrimination and the Search for Equality    Early cultural diversity requirements frequently involved courses that dealt with one or more previously excluded or neglected identity groups. There certainly remains a need to infuse the curriculum with voices and perspectives long excluded from it. More recently, however, there has been a movement away from courses driven primarily by identity categories toward courses that focus on systemic examinations of prejudice and discrimination. Haverford College, for example, moved from a required course that examined either (1) the history, perspectives, and cultures of non-Western peoples, U.S. minorities, or women or (2) the nature, history, and workings of prejudice to a single Social Justice requirement. Temple University requires students to take one course in American Cultures and another in Studies in Race. American Cultures courses cover the evolution of such ideas as equality of opportunity, classlessness, social mobility, and equality under the law. Studies in Race courses examine the impact of race and racism on social, cultural, and political institutions. SUNY–Buffalo requires all sophomores to take a course on  ""American Pluralism and the Search for Equality"" .    Expanding Definitions and Comparative Perspectives    Campuses are beginning to see value in inclusive definitions of diversity. The University of Massachusetts–Boston credits its success in winning widespread support for its two-course requirement to the breadth of its definition of diversity. Diversity courses there include not only issues of race, gender, and social class, but also age, disability, and sexual orientation. At other institutions across the country, issues of disability, sexual orientation, and religious diversity are being explored more frequently, but, as yet, fewer courses have actually been approved in these areas compared to courses that address issues of race, class, and/or gender.            ""A curriculum for diversity must do more than relate the individual stories of racial and ethnic minorities. It must integrate their cultural perspectives, divergent socioeconomic experiences, and political histories into a broader, enriched discussion about both the commonalities and differences among cultures and values, the tragedies and triumphs in the making of American society.""  -- Manning Marable  Columbia University            Some campuses are also stressing comparative perspectives. The University of California, Berkeley requires all students to take a course in American Cultures that examines comparatively African Americans, Chicanos/Latinos, Native Americans, and European Americans. Iowa State University's recently passed requirement is designed to educate students concerning the nature and history of exclusion and oppression and must engage them in comparative and cross-cultural study. Most of the campuses we have reviewed have also begun incorporating a more sophisticated understanding of the multiple and intersecting influences that affect how one defines one's own identity and how one is defined by the larger society.     Relational Knowing and Education for Social Responsibility    The development of new diversity curricula has also been powerfully influenced by two other important pedagogical developments: an emphasis, advanced through women's studies, on ""connected"" or ""relational"" forms of knowing, and the related emphasis, emerging from many quarters, on ""experiential"" as well as analytical learning. The influence of these movements toward experiential and relational knowing can be seen in the design of many diversity courses, which frequently include such pedagogies as cultural encounters, service learning, reflective journals, collaborative projects, linked courses, and a variety of other strategies designed to give students direct experience with the complexities of negotiating difference in a collective setting.    While few campuses actually require service-learning courses that address issues of diversity, many have begun to see that the goal of providing students with skills for a diverse world can be served well by engaging them in ""real-world"" situations in diverse settings. Very promising conversations and collaborations have begun that bring together experts in diversity learning and service learning. Hobart and William Smith Colleges are developing an interdisciplinary program in community-based learning that is thoroughly infused with issues of diversity. Issues of diversity and justice are explored in traditional classroom settings and with traditional texts but are also studied in the context of the work students are actually doing in local communities. Olivet College, with support from the Kellogg Foundation, is currently reorientating all campus activities, including its curriculum, to infuse an ethic of individual and social responsibility into all aspects of campus life.    Some campuses have decided that it is essential for students to make the connections between what they are learning about diversity in the classroom and what they are experiencing outside of the classroom. Efforts that bring together student- life programs with classroom instruction about diversity show enormous promise. Iowa State University, for example, offers a one-credit course on ""Dialogues in Diversity."" Facilitated by three-person teams that include a faculty member, a student, and a staff member, these courses involve weekly seminars that explore diversity issues related first to campus life and then gradually to local community issues and wider societal concerns.    Skills as Well as Content: Defining Learning Goals for Diversity Courses    Many campuses are now working to achieve greater clarity in delineating learning goals for diversity courses. These goals now include not only the knowledge students need about the history and current status of previously neglected groups, but also the skills students need to function in a diverse world--skills at recognizing the role of diverse backgrounds and influences on political decision-making and civic life, intercultural communication, conflict resolution, and problem-solving. North Seattle Community College requires that students in diversity courses learn how ""to deal constructively with information, ideas, and emotions associated with diversity and conflict."" Bloomfield College has identified multiracial/ multicultural awareness as one of a series of competencies viewed as the responsibility of all areas of the college curriculum and co-curriculum.             ""Education for today's democracy in a more multicultural America must reacquaint students to the possibility and idealism of an inclusive, intercultural democracy....The arts of democracy, namely, dialogue, engagement, and responsible participation, help students grow from intercultural experience and create democratic sensibilities.""   -- Richard Guarasci  Hobart and William Smith Colleges            Faculty Development and Ongoing Assessment    In order to sustain the vitality and continued growth of curriculum transformation efforts, campuses are focusing increasingly on faculty development. As John Noonan, president of Bloomfield College notes, ""faculty can't teach what they don't know."" Campuses are instituting faculty development efforts that range in scope from modest course development grants to ongoing summer institutes. Many are making effective use of ""Teaching and Learning Centers"" to develop faculty development opportunities and especially to help faculty members develop new pedagogical techniques as well as new content for their diversity courses.     Student Involvement in Curricular Change    Across the country, faculty report that students' quests to make sense of their own experiences with identity, campus diversity, and inequality are a significant driver in curriculum transformation. The real challenge, many campuses are realizing, is to create safe spaces where students can explore complex issues honestly and with respect for one another's histories, perspectives, and aspirations.    Maxine Greene of Columbia's Teachers College crystallizes this merging of lived experience and reflection that infuses new diversity courses and programs. Educators, she urges, can help their students tell ""the stories of what they are seeking, what they know and might not yet know, exchanging stories with others grounded in other landscapes.'It is at moments like these that persons begin to recognize each other and, in the experience of recognition, feel the need to take responsibility for each other.""              Critics Note Diversity Momentum   According to a report issued by the National Association of Scholars, of 50 top-ranked universities and liberal arts colleges (ranked by U.S. News and World Report as of fall 1989), diversity requirements were found at 25 institutions. These requirements had an average of about 44 courses available to fulfill them and constituted an average of 3.8 percent of the baccalaureate requirements at the schools where they were found. These requirements include, among others, the ""American Cultures"" requirement at the University of California, Berkeley; the ""Social Justice"" requirement at Haverford College; and the ""Cultural Diversity"" requirement at Davidson College.

Specific concerns may be found on the  talk page . See Wikipedia's  guide to writing better articles  for suggestions.  (February 2009)       For other uses, see  SAT (disambiguation) .   The  SAT Reasoning Test  (formerly  Scholastic Aptitude Test  and  Scholastic Assessment Test ) is a  standardized test  for  college admissions  in the  United States . The SAT is owned, published, and developed by the  College Board , a  non-profit organization  in the United States, and was once developed, published, and scored by the  Educational Testing Service  (ETS). [ 1 ]  ETS now administers the exam.   The current SAT Reasoning Test is administered in about four and one half hours and costs $50 ($71 International), excluding late fees. [ 2 ]  Since the SAT's introduction in 1901, its name and scoring has changed several times. In 2005, the test was renamed as ""SAT Reasoning Test"" with possible scores from 600 to 2400 combining test results from three 800-point sections (math, critical reading, and writing), along with other subsections scored separately.

They state that the SAT assesses how well the test takers analyze and solve problemsskills they learned in school that they will need in college. The SAT is typically taken by  high school   juniors  and  seniors . [ 3 ]  Specifically, the College Board states that use of the SAT in combination with high school grade point average (GPA) provides a better indicator of success in college than high school grades alone, as measured by college freshman  GPA . Various studies conducted over the lifetime of the SAT show a statistically significant increase in  correlation  of high school grades and freshman grades when the SAT is factored in. [ 4 ]   There are substantial differences in funding, curricula, grading, and difficulty among U.S. secondary schools due to American  federalism , local control, and the prevalence of private, distance, and  home schooled  students. SAT (and  ACT ) scores are intended to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local datasuch as course work, grades, and class rankin a national perspective. [ 5 ]   Historically, the SAT has been more popular among colleges in the coasts and the ACT more popular in the Midwest and South. There are some colleges that require the ACT to be taken for college course placement, and a few schools that do not accept the SAT at all.  [ 6 ]   Certain high IQ societies, like  Mensa  and the  Triple Nine Society , use scores from certain years as one of their admission tests. For instance, the  Triple Nine Society  accepts scores of 1450 on tests taken before April 1995, and scores of at least 1520 on tests taken between April 1995 and February 2005.     [ edit ]   Structure   SAT consists of three major sections: Critical  Reading ,  Mathematics , and  Writing . Each section receives a score on the scale of 200800. All scores are multiples of 10. Total scores are calculated by adding up scores of the three sections. Each major section is divided into three parts. There are 10 sub-sections, including an additional 25-minute experimental or ""equating"" section that may be in any of the three major sections. The experimental section is used to  normalize  questions for future administrations of the SAT and does not count toward the final score. The test contains 3 hours and 45 minutes of actual timed sections, [ 7 ]  although most administrations, including orientation, distribution of materials, completion of biographical sections, and eleven minutes of timed breaks, run about four and a half hours long.     [ edit ]   Critical Reading   The Critical Reading, formerly verbal, section of the SAT is made up of three scored sections, two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, with varying types of questions, including sentence completions and questions about short and long reading passages. Critical Reading sections normally begin with 5 to 8 sentence completion questions; the remainder of the questions are focused on the reading passages. Sentence completions generally test the student's  vocabulary  and understanding of sentence structure and organization by requiring the student to select one or two words that best complete a given sentence. The bulk of the Critical Reading questions is made up of questions regarding reading passages, in which students read short excerpts on social sciences, humanities, physical sciences, or personal narratives and answer questions based on the passage. Certain sections contain passages asking the student to compare two related passages; generally, these consist of short reading passages as well as longer passages. Since this is a timed test, the number of questions about each passage is proportional to the length of the passage.     [ edit ]   Mathematics   The  Mathematics  section of SAT is widely known as Quantitative Section. Mathematics section consists of three scored sections. There are two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, as follows:     One of the 25-minute sections is entirely multiple choice, with 20 questions.   The other 25-minute section contains 8 multiple choice questions and 10 grid-in questions.   The 20-minute is all multiple choice, with only 16 questions.     Notably, the SAT has done away with quantitative comparison questions on the math section, leaving only questions with straightforward  symbolic  or  numerical  answers. Since the quantitative comparison questions were well-known for their deceptive natureoften turning on the student's recognition of a single exception to a rule or patternthis choice has been equated to a philosophical shift away from ""trickery"" and toward ""straight math"" on the SAT. Also, many test experts have attributed this change, like the addition of the new writing section, to an attempt to make the SAT more like the  ACT . Indeed, there is a correlation between ACT scores and SAT scores. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Writing          Page 1 of an SAT essay. This student received a 7/12 from two judges, one giving 3/6 and the other giving 4/6.              Page 2 of the same essay.       The writing section of the SAT, based on but not directly comparable to the old SAT II subject test in writing, includes multiple choice questions and a brief essay. The essay subscore contributes about 30% towards the total writing score, with the multiple choice questions contributing 70%. This section was implemented in March 2005 following complaints from colleges about the lack of uniform examples of a student's writing ability.   The multiple choice questions include error identification questions, sentence improvement questions, and paragraph improvement questions. Error identification and sentence improvement questions test the student's knowledge of grammar, presenting an awkward or grammatically incorrect sentence; in the error identification section, the student must locate the word producing the source of the error or indicate that the sentence has no error, while the sentence improvement section requires the student to select an acceptable fix to the awkward sentence. The paragraph improvement questions test the student's understanding of logical organization of ideas, presenting a poorly written student essay and asking a series of questions as to what changes might be made to best improve it.   The essay section, which is always administered as the first section of the test, is 25 minutes long. All essays must be in response to a given prompt. The prompts are broad and often philosophical and are designed to be accessible to students regardless of their educational and social backgrounds. For instance, test takers may be asked to expound on such ideas as their opinion on the value of work in human life or whether technological change also carries negative consequences to those who benefit from it. No particular essay structure is required, and the College Board accepts examples ""taken from [the student's] reading, studies, experience, or observations."" Two trained readers assign each essay a score between 1 and 6, where a score of 0 is reserved for essays that are blank, off-topic, non-English, not written with a Number 2 pencil, or considered illegible after several attempts at reading. The scores are summed to produce a final score from 2 to 12 (or 0). If the two readers' scores differ by more than one point, then a senior third reader decides. The average time each reader/grader spends on each essay is less than 3 minutes.  [ 10 ]   Despite the  College Board 's claims that the SAT Essay is a nonbiased assessment of a student's writing ability, many different claims of bias have surfaced, including claims that readers give higher points to those who write in cursive, writers who write about personal experiences are less likely to get higher scores, and that topics favor the higher social classes. [ citation needed ]  The College Board strictly denies any forms of bias on all portions of the SAT Reasoning Exam. In addition, essays with factual errors were not penalized for the errors.   In March 2004 Dr. Les Perelman analyzed 15 scored sample essays contained in the College Board's Score Write book and found that 90% of essays that contained more than 400 words got the highest score of 12 and that the essays with 100 words or fewer got the lowest grade of 1. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Questions   Most of the questions on the SAT are  multiple choice ; all multiple-choice questions have five answer choices, one of which is correct. The questions of each section of the same type are generally ordered by difficulty. However, an important exception exists: Questions that follow the long and short reading passages are organized chronologically, rather than by difficulty. Ten of the questions in one of the math sub-sections are not multiple choice. They instead require the test taker to bubble in a number in a four-column grid.   The questions are weighted equally. For each correct answer, one raw point is added. For each incorrect answer one-fourth of a point is deducted. [ 11 ]  No points are deducted for incorrect math grid-in questions. This ensures that a student's  mathematically expected gain  from guessing is zero. The final score is derived from the raw score; the precise conversion chart varies between test administrations.   The SAT therefore recommends only making educated guesses, that is, when the test taker can eliminate at least one answer he or she thinks is wrong. Without eliminating any answers one's probability of answering correctly is 20%. Eliminating one wrong answer increases this probability to 25%; two, a 33.3% probability; three, a 50% probability of choosing the correct answer and thus earning the full point for the question.

The test is typically offered on the first Saturday of the month for the November, December, May, and June administrations. In other countries, the SAT is offered on the same dates as in the  United States  except for the first spring test date (i.e., March or April), which is not offered. In 2006, the test was taken 1,465,744 times. [ 12 ]   Candidates may either take the SAT Reasoning Test or up to three  SAT Subject Tests  on any given test date, except the first spring test date, when only the SAT Reasoning Test is offered. Candidates wishing to take the test may register online at the College Board's website, by mail, or by telephone, at least three weeks before the test date.   The SAT Subject Tests are all given in one large book on test day. Therefore, it is actually immaterial which tests, and how many, the student signs up for; with the possible exception of the language tests with listening, the student may change his or her mind and take  any  tests, regardless of his or her initial sign-ups. Students who choose to take more subject tests than they signed up for will later be billed by College Board for the additional tests and their scores will be withheld until the bill is paid. Students who choose to take fewer subject tests than they signed up for are not eligible for a refund.   The SAT Reasoning Test costs $45 ($71 International). For the Subject tests, students pay a $20 Basic Registration Fee and $9 per test (except for language tests with listening, which cost $20 each). [ 2 ]  The College Board makes fee waivers available for low income students. Additional fees apply for late registration, standby testing, registration changes, scores by telephone, and extra score reports (beyond the four provided for free).   Candidates whose religious beliefs prevent them from taking the test on a Saturday may request to take the test on the following Sunday, except for the October test date in which the Sunday test date is eight days after the main test offering. Such requests must be made at the time of registration and are subject to denial.   Students with verifiable disabilities, including physical and learning disabilities, are eligible to take the SAT with accommodations. The standard time increase for students requiring additional time due to learning disabilities is 50%.     [ edit ]   Raw scores, scaled scores, and percentiles   Students receive their online score reports approximately three weeks after test administration (six weeks for mailed, paper scores), with each section graded on a scale of 200800 and two sub scores for the writing section: the essay score and the multiple choice sub score. In addition to their score, students receive their  percentile  (the percentage of other test takers with lower scores). The raw score, or the number of points gained from correct answers and lost from incorrect answers (ranges from just under 50 to just under 60, depending upon the test), is also included. [ 13 ]  Students may also receive, for an additional fee, the Question and Answer Service, which provides the student's answer, the correct answer to each question, and online resources explaining each question.   The corresponding percentile of each scaled score varies from test to testfor example, in 2003, a scaled score of 800 in both sections of the SAT Reasoning Test corresponded to a percentile of 99.9, while a scaled score of 800 in the SAT Physics Test corresponded to the 94th percentile. The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are because of the content of the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to intensive study (often in the form of an  AP , which is relatively more difficult), and only those who know they will perform well tend to take these tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores.   The percentiles that various SAT scores for college-bound seniors correspond to are summarized in the following chart: [ 14 ] [ 12 ]       Percentile   Score, 1600 Scale  (official, 2006)   Score, 2400 Scale  (official, 2006)       99.93/99.98*   1600   2400       99+   1540   2290       99   1480   2200       98   1450   2140       97   1420   2100       88   1380   1900       83   1280   1800       78   1200   1770       72   1150   1700       61   1090   1600       48   1010   1500       36   950   1400       15   810   1200       4   670   1010       1   520   790       * The percentile of the perfect score was 99.98 on the 2400 scale and 99.93 on the 1600 scale.       The older SAT (before 1995) had a very high ceiling. In any given year, only seven of the million test-takers scored above 1580. A score above 1580 was equivalent to the 99.9995 percentile. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   SAT-ACT score comparisons          Map of states according to preferred exam of 2006 high school graduates. States in orange had more students taking the SAT than the  ACT .       Although there is no official conversion chart between the SAT and its biggest rival, the  ACT , the College Board released an unofficial chart based on results from 103,525 test takers who took both tests between October 1994 and December 1996  here ; however, both tests have changed since then. Several colleges have also issued their own charts. The following is based on the University of California's conversion chart.

[ edit ]   1901 test   The College Board began on June 17, 1901, when 973 students took its first test, across 67 locations in the United States, and two in Europe. Although those taking the test came from a variety of backgrounds, approximately one third were from  New York ,  New Jersey , or  Pennsylvania . The majority of those taking the test were from private schools, academies, or endowed schools. About 60% of those taking the test applied to  Columbia University . The test contained sections on English,  French ,  German ,  Latin ,  Greek , history, mathematics,  chemistry , and  physics . The test was not multiple choice, but instead was evaluated based on essay responses as ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""doubtful,"" ""poor,"" or ""very poor.""  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   1926 test   The first administration of the SAT occurred on June 23, 1926, when it was known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of  definitions ,  arithmetic , classification, artificial language,  antonyms , number series,  analogies ,  logical inference , and paragraph reading. It was administered to over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to  Yale University  and  Smith College  respectively.  [ 20 ]  The test was paced rather quickly, test-takers being given only a little over 90 minutes to answer 315 questions. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1928 and 1929 tests   In 1928 the number of verbal sections was reduced to 7, and the time limit was increased to slightly under two hours. In 1929 the number of sections was again reduced, this time to 6. These changes in part loosened time constraints on test-takers. Math was eliminated entirely for these tests, instead focusing only on verbal ability. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1930 test and 1936 changes   In 1930 the SAT was first split into the verbal and math sections, a structure that would continue through 2004. The verbal section of the 1930 test covered a more narrow range on content than its predecessors, examining only antonyms, double definitions (somewhat similar to sentence completions), and paragraph reading. In 1936, analogies were re-added. Between 1936 and 1946, students had between 80 and 115 minutes to answer 250 verbal questions (over a third of which were on antonyms). The mathematics test introduced in 1930 contained 100 free response questions to be answered in 80 minutes, and focused primarily on speed. From 1936 to 1941, like the 1928 and 1929 tests, the mathematics section was eliminated entirely. When the mathematics portion of the test was re-added in 1942, it consisted of multiple choice questions. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1946 test and associated changes   Paragraph reading was eliminated from the verbal portion of the SAT in 1946, and replaced with reading comprehension, and ""double definition"" questions were replaced with sentence completions. Between 1946 and 1957 students were given 90 to 100 minutes to complete 107 to 170 verbal questions. Starting in 1958 time limits became more stable, and for 17 years, until 1975, students had 75 minutes to answer 90 questions. In 1959 questions on data sufficiency were introduced to the mathematics section, and then replaced with quantitative comparisons in 1974. In 1974 both verbal and math sections were reduced from 75 minutes to 60 minutes each, with changes in test composition compensating for the decreased time. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1980 test and associated changes   The inclusion of the ""Strivers"" Score study was implemented. This study was introduced by The Educational Testing Service, which administers the SAT, and has been conducting research on how to make it easier for minorities and individuals who suffer from social and economic barriers. The original ""Strivers"" project, which was in the research phase from 19801994, awarded special ""Striver"" status to test-takers who scored 200 points higher than expected for their race, gender and income level. The belief was that this would give minorities a better chance at being accepted in to a college of higher standard, i.e. an Ivy League school. In 1992, the Strivers Project was leaked to the public; as a result the Strivers Project was terminated in 1993. After Federal Courts heard arguments from the ACLU, NAACP and the Educational Testing Service, the courts ordered the study to alter its data collection process, stating that only the age, race and zip code could be used to determine the test-takers eligibility for ""Strivers"" points. These changes were introduced to the SAT effective in 1994.     [ edit ]   1994 changes   In 1994 the verbal section received a dramatic change in focus. Among these changes were the removal of  antonym  questions, and an increased focus on passage reading. The mathematics section also saw a dramatic change in 1994, thanks in part to pressure from the  National Council of Teachers of Mathematics . For the first time since 1935, the SAT asked some non-multiple choice questions, instead requiring students to supply the answers. 1994 also saw the introduction of calculators into the mathematics section for the first time in the test's history. The mathematics section introduced concepts of probability, slope, elementary statistics, counting problems, median and mode. [ 19 ]   The average score on the 1994 modification of the SAT I was usually around 1000 (500 on the verbal, 500 on the math). The most selective schools in the United States (for example, those in the  Ivy League ) typically had SAT averages exceeding 1400 on the old test.     [ edit ]   2002 changes - Score Choice   In October 2002, the College Board dropped the Score Choice Option. Under this option, scores were not released to colleges until the student saw and approved of the score. [ 21 ]  The reasoning was that the option benefited wealthier students who could afford to take it multiple times. The College Board has since decided to re-implement Score Choice in the spring of 2009. It is described as optional, and it is not clear if the reports sent will indicate whether or not this student has opted-in or not. A number of highly selective colleges and universities have accounced they will require applicants to submit all scores, including Harvard, Cornell, Yale and Stanford. Others, such as MIT, have embraced Score Choice.     [ edit ]   2005 changes   In 2005, the test was changed again, largely in response to criticism by the  University of California system . [ 22 ]  Because of issues concerning ambiguous questions, especially  analogies , certain types of questions were eliminated (the analogies from the verbal and quantitative comparisons from the Math section). The test was made marginally harder, as a corrective to the rising number of perfect scores. A new writing section, with an essay, based on the former SAT II Writing Subject Test, was added, in part to increase the chances of closing the opening gap between the highest and midrange scores. Other factors included the desire to test the writing ability of each student in a personal manner; hence the essay. The New SAT (known as the SAT Reasoning Test) was first offered on March 12, 2005, after the last administration of the ""old"" SAT in January of 2005. The Mathematics section was expanded to cover three years of high school mathematics. The Verbal section's name was changed to the Critical Reading section.     [ edit ]   2008 changes   In 2008, or rather for the late 2008, 2009 testing, a new variable came into play. Before, it was required for applicants to most colleges to submit all scores with some colleges who embraced Score Choice to allow their students to do so. However, this year, applicants now have the choice to submit their best score (in theory one could send any score they wish to send) to the college of their choice, no matter the college. Designed to reduce stress to applicants as well as make the overall process easier, students in many schools have embraced this change with a sigh of relief.     [ edit ]   Name changes and recentered scores   Although originally standing for ""Scholastic Aptitude Test"" [ 23 ] , in 1990, because of uncertainty about the SAT's ability to function as an  intelligence test , the name was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test. In 1993 the name was changed to SAT I: Reasoning Test (with the  letters not standing for anything ) to distinguish it from the  SAT II: Subject Tests [ 23 ] . In 2004, the roman numerals on both tests were dropped, and the SAT I renamed the SAT Reasoning Test [ 23 ] . The scoring categories are now the following: Critical Reading (comparable to some of the Verbal portions of the old SAT I), Mathematics, and Writing. The writing section now includes an essay, whose score is involved in computing the overall score for the Writing section, as well as grammar sections (also comparable to some Verbal portions of the previous SAT).   The test scoring was initially scaled to make 500 the mean score on each section with a  standard deviation  of 100. [ 24 ]  As the test grew more popular and more students from less rigorous schools began taking the test, the average dropped to about 428 Verbal and 478 Math. The SAT was ""recentered"" in 1995, and the average ""new"" score became again close to 500. Scores awarded after 1994 and before October 2001 are officially reported with an ""R"" (e.g. 1260R) to reflect this change. Old scores may be recentered to compare to 1995 to present scores by using official College Board tables [ 25 ]  , which in the middle ranges add about 70 points to Verbal and 20 or 30 points to Math. In other words, current students have a 100 (70 plus 30) point advantage over their parents.     [ edit ]   Controversy     [ edit ]   Scoring problems of October 2005 tests   In March 2006, it was announced that a small percentage of the SATs taken in October 2005 had been scored incorrectly due to the test papers being moist and not scanning properly, and that some students had received substantially erroneous scores. The College Board announced they would change the scores for the students who were given a lower score than they earned, but at this point many of those students had already applied to colleges using their original scores. The College Board decided not to change the scores for the students who were given a higher score than they earned. A lawsuit was filed in 2005 by about 4,400 students who received an incorrect low score on the SAT. The class-action suit was settled in August 2007 when The College Board and another company that administers the college-admissions test announced they would pay $2.85 million to over 4,000 students. Under the agreement each student can either elect to receive $275 or submit a claim for more money if he or she feels the damage was even greater. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Criticism     [ edit ]   Bias                        As depicted above, SAT scores vary according to race, income, and parental educational background.       A famous example of alleged bias in the SAT I was the  oarsman - regatta  analogy question. [ 27 ]  The object of the question was to find the pair of terms that have the relationship most similar to the relationship between ""runner"" and ""marathon."" The correct answer was ""oarsman"" and ""regatta."" Choice of the correct answer presupposed students' familiarity with a sport popular with the wealthy, and so upon their knowledge of its structure and terminology. Fifty-three percent (53%) of white students - who in greater numbers come from higher income households - correctly answered the question, while only 22% of black students - who disproportionately came from lower income households - also scored correctly. [ 28 ]  Analogy questions have since been replaced by short reading passages.     [ edit ]   Dropping SAT   A growing number of  liberal arts colleges  have responded to this criticism by joining the  SAT optional movement . These colleges do not require the SAT for admission.   In a 2001 speech to the  American Council on Education ,  Richard C. Atkinson , then president of the  University of California , urged dropping the SAT Reasoning Test as a college admissions requirement:     ""Anyone involved in education should be concerned about how overemphasis on the SAT is distorting educational priorities and practices, how the test is perceived by many as unfair, and how it can have a devastating impact on the self-esteem and aspirations of young students. There is widespread agreement that overemphasis on the SAT harms American education."" [ 29 ]     In response to threats by the University of California to drop the SAT as an admission requirement, the College Entrance Examination Board announced the restructuring of the SAT, to take effect in March 2005, as detailed above.     [ edit ]   Essay   In 2005,  MIT  Writing Director  Les Perelman  plotted essay length versus essay score on the new SAT from released essays and found a high correlation between them. After studying 23 graded essays he found that the longer the essay was the higher the score. He also discovered that several of these essays were full of factual errors. However, the official SAT guide for scorers state that the essays should be scored according to their quality of writing and not factual accuracy. The National Council of Teachers of English also criticize the 25-minute writing section of the test, arguing that the basic principles of writing encourage the revision of written material several times. They say that the amount of time allowed for the test pushes schools to develop a formulaic system of writing. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Test preparation   Many companies and organizations offer test preparation in the form of books, classes, online courses, tutoring and only recently, board games. Large organizations include  Kaplan ,  the Princeton Review , PowerScore, Barron's, Elite Educational Institute, Revolution Prep, Ivy Insiders, Testmasters, SAT Solutions, and College Board (the test makers), as well as some boutique organizations such as Los Angeles-based College Prep Review. Some have criticized the SAT test because preparation often can lead to much higher scores, but some have embraced the opportunity to improve their scores.

Most business programs will not consider your application without GMAT results.                                                                           The GMAT is a critical element of your application to any business school. GMAT scores are now increasingly used in hiring business graduates—many reputable companies use GMAT scores for recruiting MBA’s. The importance of the GMAT score therefore does not end with your admittance to a good business school; your GMAT score is a veritable entry to your résumé.                                                     In many ways admissions and recruitment are similar—they are both about elimination. A good GMAT score can get you through that proverbial funnel of admissions without being eliminated. A good GMAT score cannot ensure you a spot in the school of your choice, but a mediocre score can keep you out.                                                     The Admissions Committee of a business school uses your GMAT score for measuring your academic ability, and for comparing, on an even keel, your credentials with those of other candidates. The GMAT thus gives the Committee a standardized means to compare candidates with vastly differing backgrounds, accomplishments, skill-sets, and aspirations.                                                                             Did you know that the MBA degree accounts for 25% of all graduate degrees awarded in the United States? Hence, at least one quarter of all students pursuing graduate studies will take the GMAT test. If you are planning or even contemplating being one of them, enroll today in GMAT Score preparation courses that are far and away the best tools for preparing you for the rigors of the GMAT exam.Global competition for admission to top business schools remains intense. From Houston to Hyderabad, from Singapore to Shanghai, from Boston to Beijing, your GMAT score will be a clear differentiator    —a good score will help you stand out from the crowd.                                                 A good GMAT score:                                                                                                                                      allows the Admissions Committee to overlook situations where a candidate has a mediocre GPA or has attended a not-well-known undergraduate institution;                                                                                                                                        reinforces an applicant’s academic abilities by establishing a common-denominator scale of comparing the applicant with other applicants;                                                                                                                                     provides a reasonably good indication as to how well an admitee will perform in the first year of the MBA program (the first-year GPA has been found to correlate well with GMAT scores).                                                                                                               The GMAT measures general verbal, mathematical, and analytical writing skills. It does not test advanced mathematics, arcane English grammar rules, business competence, or specific subject knowledge.                             The GMAT consists of three sections, and provides section scores that contribute to your overall performance in the test:                                                                                                                   Analytical Writing Assessment;                                                                                                                                                  Quantitative;                                                                                                                                                  Verbal.                                                                                                                                                                                      The GMAT is a challenging test, but if you train effectively and efficiently for the test, you will see a dramatic improvement in your score.

It enables us to provide the kind of broad, enriching  educational experience for which the university has long been known.              Because  we are a public institution, our students, faculty and staff must reflect the  broad diversity of the state of California.  We take great pride in the many backgrounds represented on our campus.         UCLA  has a great legacy of preparing leaders from all segments of society who have  gone on to make significant contributions all over the world.         We are  deeply committed to ensuring the continued diversity of our campus. We will do  whatever we can, legally and appropriately, to preserve and expand the diverse  nature of our university community.        To  support diversity efforts, the  Chancellor’s Advisory Group on Diversity (CAGD)  was  appointed in September 1998 to help advance, sustain and promote campus  diversity. This work is essential to furthering the widely shared purposes  of maintaining UCLA as a premier institution, noted for its excellence,  richness and vibrancy. We must effect change in the patterns of  disadvantage and discrimination that are still so evident in society.         This link will take you to the  statement of diversity  that has been adopted by the  Academic Senate of the University   of California, as well as  a  letter from UC President Robert Dynes  endorsing it as the  official statement of the university.        Consistent  with the university’s commitment to achieve and maintain diversity, we at UCLA  are continually working to increase the broad spectrum of perspectives  available on our campus, which are critical to our mission of teaching,  research and service.

In order to be accepted into a graduate management or business school, most individuals will need to take the Graduate Management Admission Test.  This test has been developed by the Graduate Management Admission Council to provide a consistent measure of the academic skill of prospective students.  The GMAT test assesses skills that have been developed over a long period of time, rather than specific knowledge in business or other areas.  The GMAT test has three sections: Analytical Writing, Quantitative, and Verbal.  The candidate may opt to take a ten-minute break in between sections.  In the Analytical Writing Assessment, the candidate will complete two 30-minute essays-- an analysis of an issue and an analysis of an argument.  The Quantitative section consists of 37 multiple-choice questions which must be completed in 75 minutes.  These questions are either problem-solving or data sufficiency questions.  The verbal section consists of 41 multiple-choice which must be completed in 75 minutes.  These questions will either be reading comprehension, critical reasoning, or sentence correction questions.  The test-taker will receive an unofficial score report immediately after finishing the exam. Later, an official copy of the scores will be sent to the test-taker and to the relevant institutions.  The GMAT test score report will contain four scores: verbal, quantitative, total, and analytical writing assessment.  The verbal and quantitative scores will range from 0 to 60, and the total score will range from 200 to 800.  The analytical writing assessment score will be an average of the scores assigned to the analyses of issue and argument; each short essay will be scored by two judges on a scale of 1 to 6, and these scores will be averaged.  The GMAT test is administered by the Graduate Management Admission Council at locations around the country; to register, visit the GMAC website.

Continue to monitor the recruitment of women and minority faculty at the senior levels, consistent with the available pool.           Continue to encourage and monitor the recruitment of women and minority faculty at all levels, consistent with the available pool.           Continue to recruit, retain and graduate greater numbers of ethnic minority students.           Continue to work with the central Ohio community to promote understanding and effectiveness of diversity, and engage communities throughout Ohio in the dialogue.           The accountability has been at the level of Deans.  The University Council on Diversity feels that if progress is to be made, the level of accountability has to involve all levels of administration,           most notably the chairs.           Diversity at OSU seems to be improving at a quicker pace at the lower levels than at the higher levels.  There are still many more men than women among the senior professoriate, and there are           few minorities in top administrative positions.  Continue programs designed to move faculty from underrepresented groups to administrative leadership positions.           The Office of Business and Finance and the colleges need to work together to develop better strategies for tracking the use of minority vendors.  Some units do not want to take extra steps in           locating a minority vendor.  Other units have difficulty identifying and quantifying the use of minority vendors.           There needs to be a funding initiative for research on diversity.           Benchmark for diversity in ways that the University benchmarks for other areas of excellence.  Use diversity statistics from institutions with the best diversity records as a yardstick by which           to measure our diversity efforts.             Ensure systematic efforts to retain women and minority faculty members at all levels.           Develop permanent resources for diversity through the impending Campus Campaign, to build endowments for scholarships at all levels and for research.           Incorporate diversity into the strategic planning for each academic and each support unit.           Bring the diversity structure into a stronger relationship with established governance structure of the University by articulating the role of the Senate Diversity Committee so as to incorporate the           Diversity Council.           The one group that remains most underrepresented in all areas is the Native American population.           Units need to address the paucity of staff involvement in diversity, especially since staff outnumber faculty and play a critical role in making students feel at home in the University.                        Preamble         In 2001, Ohio State University adopted the Diversity Action Plan as an official set of goals for increasing diversity among students, faculty and staff, with strategies to meet those goals.  The         original plan was intended to guide and monitor University efforts for five years, beginning with the 2001-02 academic year.  That initial period ended in June 2006, and the year 2006-07 served as         a time of evaluation and reflection, with the expectation that a revised program for campus diversity would emerge from the experience and wisdom gained in the initial five years.  (See Appendix         for 2007 Summary Report of the Diversity Council.)           In retrospect, it can be generally agreed that most of the objectives which the plan put forward were met, and that from the discussions and efforts meant to support the principles of the plan, there         also emerged many unforeseen benefits to the University related to diversity.  For example, the plan stipulated specific goals for annual hiring of minority faculty members at the level of Professor         and Associate Professor—that is, at a level which implies persons of high scholarly reputation at the national and international level.  Each year through the duration of the plan, the University         met or exceeded these goals.           In addition, creativity fostered by the widespread discussions about diversity led to important new programs and services not anticipated in the original document.  These include, but are certainly         not limited to, the establishment of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America, the Todd Anthony Bell Center on the African American Male, President and Provost Leadership Institute,         Staff Leadership Institute, the World Service Program of the Office of Minority Affairs, and other programs, many of them based in the colleges, all enhancing the visibility and value of diversity at         Ohio State.          The success of the Diversity Action Plan should be measured, therefore, not only by the extent to which its strategies were followed and its stated goals were accomplished.  It should also be considered         as the document that engendered energy in many directions in the service of diversity.  On that understanding, it seems fair to say that the Diversity Action Plan was highly successful.           Yet it should also be widely understood that efforts in service of diversity must continue, that the University needs to continually renew its explicit objectives, and that in addition, it will need         to adapt effectively to the unexpected developments sure to follow in the years 2007-08 through 2011-12.   To that end, this updated plan is intended to renew the covenants that support diversity         at Ohio State and provide recommendations for goals and strategies for the next five years.         The Rationale for the University’s Commitment to Diversity         It is fitting at the outset to reiterate the commitment of The Ohio State University to creating a diverse environment, along with the rationale for such a commitment.  The document which establishes         this commitment is the Academic Plan, adopted by the University in 2001.  That plan focuses on four core elements:  “Becoming a national leader in the quality of our academic programs;         being universally recognized for the quality of the learning experience we offer our students; creating an environment that truly values and is enriched by diversity; and expanding the land-grant mission         to address our society's most compelling needs.”  In discussing the third of these elements, the one related to diversity, the Academic Plan asserts that “a growing body of research links         diversity and academic excellence. We now know that students learn better in a diverse setting. In fact, college students who experience the most racial and ethnic diversity in the classrooms and in informal         interactions on campus become better learners and better citizens. As a result, students who attend a truly diverse university are better prepared to live and work in a multi-cultural society and a global         economy.”         The Diversity Action Plan of 2001 develops this rationale further, arguing that “the nation's colleges and universities and various higher education organizations have endorsed the concept that         racial and ethnic diversity should be one factor among the many considered in admissions and hiring  in order to provide a quality education for all students.  The reasons given for their positions         are that diversity enriches the educational experience by providing students with the opportunity to learn from individuals who differ from them; promotes personal growth and a healthy society by challenging         stereotyped preconceptions, encouraging critical thinking and helping students learn to communicate effectively with people of varied backgrounds; strengthens communities and the workplace by preparing         students for citizenship in an increasingly complex, pluralistic society, and fostering mutual respect and teamwork; and enhances the country's economic competitiveness by effectively developing and using         the talents of all citizens.”          These statements make two essential points:  that diversity is philosophically essential to the nature and well being of any university; and that as a practical matter, diversity is an essential         condition for excellence in higher education.  These assertions have roots in the intellectual development of the nature of a university and of the freedom of inquiry  essential within it.  They         are prefigured by arguments in John Milton’s treatise  Areopagitica  (1644) and its direct intellectual descendant, John Stuart Mill’s essay  On Liberty  (1859).  The test         of direct adversarial confrontation between ideas yields ideas that are strong because their weaknesses are discovered in the process of discussion.  Mill states this as follows: “There is         the greatest difference between presuming an opinion to be true, because, with every opportunity for contesting it, it has not been refuted, and assuming its truth for the purpose of not permitting its         refutation. Complete liberty of contradicting and disproving our opinion, is the very condition which justifies us in assuming its truth for purposes of action; and on no other terms can a being with         human faculties have any rational assurance of being right.”  Free and open discussion and inquiry are the defining conditions of the discovery of truth, and only by diversity of opinion—and         by extension, of culture and background, can free and open discussion be effective in achieving this goal.           This rationale for a diverse university has legal consequences.  The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed this argument for diversity in its majority opinion in the case of  Grutter v.           Bollinger et al ., decided on June 23, 2003—fully two years after the initial adoption by Ohio State of the Diversity Action Plan.  That opinion in  Grutter  reasserts in part           the Court’s judgment in  The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke  (1978), in which Justice Lewis Powell emphasized that “nation’s future depends upon leaders trained           through wide exposure to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation.”  He held further that universities have a right “to select those students who will contribute the           most to the ‘robust exchange of ideas,’” and that this right supports “a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission…. [Both] tradition and           experience lend support to the view that the contribution of diversity is substantial.”          Writing for the majority in  Grutter , Justice Sandra Day O’Connor reaffirmed the essential role of diversity, which includes but is not limited to racial and ethnic diversity, in enabling “cross-racial         understanding,” which helps to break down racial stereotypes, and “enables [students] to better understand persons of different races.” These benefits are “important and laudable,” because “classroom         discussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting” when the students have “the greatest possible variety of backgrounds.” In short, diversity promotes         the “robust exchange of ideas” that Milton, Mill, Powell and O’Connor call for in a free society.  Like all universities, Ohio State has, to paraphrase Justice Powell, an essential         relationship to the Freedom of Speech protected by the First Amendment:  this relationship is the basis for the idea and the ideal of Academic Freedom, and it is realized in part by our inclusive         commitment to diversity.  It should be noted the Court explicitly rejected diversity achieved by quotas or by reliance on race or ethnicity as a sole criterion of admission, and in a related case         applied a test of inclusiveness, which further supports the need for diversity.         Some Achievements of the Diversity Action Plan         The leadership of Ohio State has consistently and strongly supported and defended the value of diversity in promoting excellence in education, from the adoption of the Diversity Action Plan in 2001 through         today.  Academic departments and colleges, as well as non-academic units have advocated for diversity and sought to implement it thoughtfully in their programs.  The major accomplishments related         to the Diversity Action Plan make up an impressive list and include:                   Recruitment of women and minority faculty at senior levels .  The objective of the original plan was to increase the number of women and minority faculty in five years by the following:                 Female 25% N=197                                              African-American 30% N=28                                  Asian-American 10% N=21          Hispanic American 30% N=13          Native-American 100% N=3          At the beginning of the 2006-07 academic year, the figures for these groups were as follows:         Female up 22.6%; increase of N=196                      African-American up 25.7%; increase of N=27                      Asian-American up 57.9%; increase of N=140          Hispanic American up 70.6%; increase of N=36          Native-American down 25%; decrease of N=1         These results show substantial increases in all but the Native American faculty population.  Some exceed the numbers set in the Diversity Action Plan; others are very close to them.                     Undergraduate Student Recruitment and Retention .  Minority undergraduate student enrollments stood at 1,081 NFQF in 2000 and at 976 in 2006.  The subtotals by category grew for Asian           Americans and Hispanic Americans, with a small drop for Native Americans.  The major drop occurred for African Americans and followed the Supreme Court decisions of June 2003.  A similar drop           was experienced for this population by all but one of the CIC schools and by other similar institutions.       However, African American retention rose substantially from 2000 to 2006:  the           most recent data show a first-year retention rate for African American males of 90.8%, and for all African Americans of 89.3%.       For all Hispanic American students, retention is up significantly,           from 76.9% in 2000 to 89.3% in 2006.       For Native American students, retention is up from 75.0% in 2000 to 82.8% in 2006.  Similarly for Asian American students, retention is up from 89.3%           in 2000 to 94.3% in 2006.                                  Graduate and Professional Student Recruitment and Retention .  Among the professional programs, the number of minority students varies significantly.  For example, the Fisher College           of Business, the Moritz College of Law and more recently the College of Medicine have strong records of effective recruitment and enrollment of minority students.  The Colleges of Optometry, and           Pharmacy have also recently had substantial increases for minorities.                 Within the Graduate School African American enrollments have declined, with a concomitant dramatic rise in the number of this group enrolled       in, and receiving advanced degrees from, national online institutions such as Walden, Capella, Nova, and Argosy.                   Appointment of Women and Minority Administrators .  The period from 2001 to 2006 included the appointment of many high visibility women administrators, including several deans, the provost,           and the first woman president of Ohio State.                               Development of Special Centers and Programs .  The Diversity Action Plan specifically called for the creation of a Multicultural Center and for the continued support of The Women’s           Place.   The Multicultural Center is now a unit within the Office of Student Affairs.       The Women’s Place remains within the Office of Academic Affairs, with a growing program           of activities.                           Extension of health benefits to domestic partners .  This has been accomplished.                           Guarantee that sexual orientation is not a consideration in any employment       decisions .  This is official policy of the University.                           Reduce the disparity in graduation rates between white and minority undergraduate students .  Graduation rates for all categories are rising, and the gap between majority and minority students           is closing.                                 Enlarge the Minority Scholars program .  Shortly after the adoption of the Diversity Action Plan, an increase in the number of awards – by 50, from 385 to 435 – was approved.       This           new number was exceeded in several years of the plan, and funding was made available when the number of qualified students grew.  Moreover, after the Supreme Court decisions of 2003, these awards           became more inclusive and additional funding was provided by the Provost.                            Promote the visibility of diversity efforts with appropriate communications to designated audiences .  Numerous publications resulted from this objective, including the  Diversity Update  and           the annual Diversity Report.                                Establish a Council on Diversity with wide ranging representation .  The Council was established on 2001 and continues to function, giving leadership to the oversight of diversity efforts.                           Require the development of college plans for diversity, as well as analogous plans for nonacademic units .  These are updated annually, with reports of accomplishments, in correspondence           with the Diversity Council.                                 Establish a website for Diversity .  This can be found at  www.osu.edu/diversity/                           Report regularly on campus diversity objectives and initiatives .  The campus, the community and interested alumni and friends receive a quarterly publication, the  Diversity Update ,           which has appeared regularly since Winter 2002.                       (The objectives of the 2001 Diversity Action Plan are listed in Appendix B, along with the supporting expectations called for in the 2001 plan.  The University’s actions relating to the objectives         and the specific mandates then follow.  For more detailed information, consult the annual analysis of the unit reports prepared in response to the Diversity Council’s requests; these are available         on line at  www.osu.edu/diversity/reports.php .)         Unanticipated Diversity Efforts, 2001 to 2006 .  In addition to the advances called for in the Diversity Action Plan, several important programs and projects related to diversity were realized         in the years that the plan was in effect.  These include, but are not limited to, the following:                   The Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity.  The Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity was established at The Ohio State University in May of 2003.  The focus           of the Institute is national and global. A preliminary mission, rationale and a basic structure for the Institute were articulated in a March 2002 proposal authored by an Ad Hoc Committee representing           the College of Humanities, the Moritz College of Law and The College of Social and Behavioral Sciences. This group envisioned an Institute that would establish the University as a national leader in           an emerging interdisciplinary field with significant opportunities for both academic recognition and external funding.  An extensive program of conferences, lectures, publications and similar events           is already underway, with multiple websites focused at  http://kirwaninstitute.org/ .                           The Todd Anthony Bell National Resource Center on the African American Male.  Noting that African American males were as a group statistically those least likely to be retained and to graduate,           Ohio State approved the establishment of a center for the study of the status of African American men in 2004.  Todd Bell, a former Ohio State and professional football player, worked actively           to develop the initial plans for the center.  Upon news of his untimely death, his colleagues determined to name the center in his honor, his widow was consulted and approved the memorial, and           the Todd Anthony Bell National Resource Center on the African American Male was opened in September 2005.  An endowment, supported in part with funding derived from an annual luncheon and lecture           on Ethics in American Sports, has been established to assist with the work of the center. Further information is available at  www.oma.osu.edu/brc .                           The President and Provost’s Diversity Lecture and Cultural Arts Series.  Created about the time of the establishment of the Academic Plan and the Diversity Action Plan, this annual series           brings notable speakers and artists to campus, to enrich the academic dialogue about diversity.       Notable presenters have included John Hope Franklin, I. King Jordan, Denyce Graves, Charles           Olgetree, Kenji Yoshino, and many others.  The series is now in its seventh year.  Current year events are listed at  www.osu/diversity/lecture/php .                           Race/Ethnicity: Multidisciplinary Global Contexts .   Race/Ethnicity: Multidisciplinary Global Contexts  is a peer-reviewed journal jointly produced through The Kirwan Institute           for the Study of Race and Ethnicity and the Office of Minority Affairs at The Ohio State University. Using a      “classic” text as a point of departure in each issue, the journal offers           investigations of sustained and emergent themes in the global field of race and ethnic studies. By promoting research that works across the traditional boundaries of discipline, geography, and the theory/practice           divide,  Race/Ethnicity  makes a vital contribution to the expanding discourse on race and ethnicity in the United States and throughout the world.  The first issue of this journal appeared           in October 2007.  Co-editors in chief are john a. powell, Director of the Kirwan Institute, and Mac A. Stewart, Vice Provost for Minority Affairs and Chief Diversity Officer.  Further information           is available at  www.raceethnicity.org/ .                           Assistant Vice Provost for Minority Affairs.       The number and variety of campus diversity efforts led to the creation of a new position which is in part intended to provide coordination among           the many units with diversity offices and programs.  This position was created in 2005, and the incumbent, Dr. Georgina Dodge, has had responsibility for preparing an annual diversity report. Two           issues (Spring 2006 and Spring 2007) have been published and distributed.                                 The World Service Project.  Noting that minority students historically have not participated in international educational opportunities at the same degree as non-minority students, in 2004 the           Office of Minority Affairs established a competition through which interested student can apply to funding to support travel to third world cultures where they are required to spend some of their time           as volunteers in significant service projects.  Although a relatively small number of students have participated, the recipients have traveled to Brazil, Ghana, and Malaysia.  Each recipient           is required to report in writing on his or her experience.  Funding for additional students is being sought.                           The CAMP program.  The Office of Minority Affairs received a $1.5 million grant in 2002 to participate in the national College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) which was created to assist students           who are migratory or seasonal farm workers, or the children of such workers, who meet Ohio State’s admission’s criteria.  The program targeted assistance for the first year of undergraduate           studies, but resources of the CAMP staff remain available to students even after their formal participation is complete. The Office of Minority Affairs (OMA) provides financial and continuity services           for the succeeding years, until the completion of their undergraduate degree.       Most of these students are of Latino heritage.  The grant, now complete, ran for five years.                             The Access Collaborative.  The Access Collaborative is an academic and social support program that assists low-income minority single parent students who are pursuing a college education at Ohio           State.       The program coordinates University and community support services to meet the participants’ needs as students and heads of household.  For more information, see  www.osu.edu/aas/access.htm .                           The Bias Assessment and Response Team (BART).  The Bias Assessment and Response Team (BART) is a partnership of the Offices of Minority Affairs and Student Affairs. The team receives, monitors,           refers, and, as necessary, coordinates university responses to hate and bias-related incidents that affect the university community.           Incidents may involve bias or hate grounded in race, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national           origin, age, disability, or veteran status. Established in 2006, BART serves an important long-term role in documenting patterns of incidents and informing           appropriate academic and academic support leaders so that policies, practices, and programs may be reviewed and modified to improve response and to           reduce or eliminate hate-based behaviors.                                Graduate Student Recruitment.  Through its Office of Graduate Student Recruitment and Diversity Initiatives, the Graduate School is partnering with colleges, graduate programs, and other offices           across campus to increase the visibility of Ohio State’s doctoral programs, to identify high-quality prospective students, and to create recruitment plans that bring those talented students to           Ohio State and retain them through graduation.       The Office of Graduate Recruitment and Diversity Initiatives participated in 22 recruitment events over the past year, consulted with numerous           graduate programs to create recruitment plans that address their unique circumstances, and hosted the Graduate School’s first summit on Graduate Recruitment.  The second summit will be held           in 2008 and will focus on best practices and results from last year.                           The Social Justice Cohort.  The Social Justice Cohort based in the Multicultural Center is comprised of undergraduate and graduate students interested in social change and social justice.  Students           meet for monthly coffee discussions based on creating social justice.  As part of the Diversity Leadership Transcript Program requirements, students apply for a Social Justice mini-grant to create           change in their communities.  Past student projects awarded the mini-grant include a body image workshop, a Darfur student awareness project and several community service based initiatives.                       In summary, the years since 2001 have seen substantial improvements in many aspects of the status of diversity at Ohio State.  These improvements have the continuing potential to serve the University         well and serve as a strong base for the next five years of development.  One overarching goal of the 2001 plan was to become “a leader within the higher education community with regard to diversity         and the creation of a campus culture of inclusion that creates a learning environment essential for educating students who will work and live in an increasingly diverse culture.”  The diversity         gains since 2001 have brought national prominence to Ohio State as just such a leader, as evidenced by numerous awards, surveys, and data—namely,                    For the second consecutive year, Ohio State has graduated more African American baccalaureates than any other CIC institution;           In 2006 Ohio State was designated a National Model Institution for diversity by Minority Access, Inc.           Ohio State has recently been listed among the nation’s top fifty colleges for its welcoming environment for African Americans by the magazine  Black Enterprise .           Ohio State has been designated a University sponsor for “support and commitment to the advancement of Hispanic education in the Tri-State Area,” according to the Greater Cincinnati Hispanic           Scholarship Committee.                      These achievements, taken together, confirm the existence of a solid base for establishing additional programs and directions.            Renewing the Covenant:  Directions for the Future             Under new leadership that is now in place, the commitment to diversity programs and services continues strong, along with added opportunities for new creativity and vision.  In the words of President         Gee, the University will assure continued access “to a diverse population, including low-income and first generation students who historically have not had an opportunity to experience the American         dream.”  To that end, in 2006-07, the members of the Diversity Council reviewed the unit reports from 2001 to 2006 and met with individual reporting units during 2006-07.  (See Appendix,         the Summary Report of the Diversity Council.)  The objectives identified below as new initiatives are largely derived from the Council’s analysis of those meetings and reports.         It is important to note that the recommendations in the remainder of this plan represent only part of the intended actions for diversity enhancement, since initiatives at the college level are being         developed and will be included in the strategic plans each college has been assigned to prepare and present to the Office of the Provost in September 2008.  This assignment is consistent with the         attempt (noted previously in this plan relative to the realignment of the reporting structure for the Diversity Council) to bring the ad hoc structures of the initial Diversity Action Plan into closer         conformity with the standard governance patterns of the University.  Detailed action plans by each college will therefore be made available for study in Autumn 2008.  In reviewing the college         plans, attention should be paid to appropriate reward structures for positive steps related to diversity.          a)  Selected recommendations from the 2001 plan which remain priorities :                   Continue to enhance a supportive environment for diversity, including the scholarly dialogue on diversity.           Continue to monitor the recruitment of women and minority faculty at the senior levels, consistent with the available pool.           Continue to encourage and monitor the recruitment of women and minority faculty at all levels, consistent with the available pool.           Continue to work with the central Ohio community to promote understanding and effectiveness of diversity, and engage communities throughout Ohio in the dialogue.           Continue to work with the central Ohio community to promote understanding and effectiveness of diversity, and engage communities throughout Ohio in the dialogue.                       Measures similar to those in the 2001 Plan shall be used to monitor progress on these continuing recommendations.         b) Next Steps   The term ""diversity"" means difference, variance and heterogeneity. Its opposite is sameness, similarity and homogeneity. Because the meaning is broad, it has come to mean many things to different   people. The term is used to refer to different religions, different social class or political philosophies, different capabilities or accomplishments, different sexual orientations, or different races, ethnic   groups and gender. The work of this committee and the recommendations focus on gender, and racial and ethnic differences -- the core interests of the civil and women's rights movements of the 1960s and at the   heart of the subsequent social change in this country -- and on persons with same sex orientation. This plan is, however, just the first step in a longer-term commitment to increasing diversity, in its broadest   meaning, on the campus. --Diversity   Action Plan, 2000         The 2000 Diversity Action Plan focused specifically on three groups:  race, gender, and sexual orientation.  The rationale for defining the goals narrowly was to focus efforts on three groups         that have suffered historically from overt discrimination.  However, the 2000 Diversity Action Plan acknowledged the importance of eventually broadening the definition of diversity with the last         sentence in the excerpt that appears above:  “ This plan is, however, just the first step in a longer-term commitment to increasing diversity, in its broadest meaning, on the campus.”         The current debate on defining diversity, as the Diversity Council saw during the conferences it held during the 2006-07 academic year with units throughout the university, is should the definition be         expanded beyond the three groups that were the focus of the 2000 plan.         This same debate is occurring throughout higher education as is illustrated by the following quote from  Making a Real Difference with Diversity:  A Guide to Institutional Change  by Alma R.         Clayton-Pederson, et al. (2007):         A … dilemma facing those involved in diversity work in higher education today relates to questions of definition and practice.  In some cases, diversity has multiple and seemingly endless         definitions, and many college and university leaders bypass serious engagement with the meanings held by various campus constituents.  In other cases, diversity is equated with the composition of         the student body, typically racial/ethnic or gender composition.  This important but narrow focus excludes concerns about how different constituents perceive and interact with the institutional environment.  This         narrow focus also excludes questions about how diversity plays out in the curriculum and scholarship, the status of equity in access to educational opportunities and achievement of important learning         outcomes, and many other areas.         We believe it is time to now take the second step, per the 2000 Diversity Action Plan, and begin addressing diversity at The Ohio State University in broader terms.         However, we also believe it is important not to lose the focus of the 2000 Diversity Action Plan on the continuing struggle to eliminate the impact of overt discrimination against groups that have historically         suffered from discrimination.         Thus, we recommend that the next phase for our diversity action at Ohio State University have two foci:  eliminating discrimination and achieving diversity.  Both are equally important and         both need to be pursued with equal vigor.         Eliminating Discrimination         We acknowledge that prejudices and discrimination exist in our community. The university community needs to re-commit to efforts to combat prejudices in our midst.  Likewise, we need to re-commit         to eliminating illegal discrimination that still afflicts students, faculty, and staff in our society and at our university.  Federal and state law, as well as university policy, define the specific         groups that are protected from discrimination as:         age, color, disability, gender identity or expression, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status.         The first step in re-committing to the goal of eliminating illegal discrimination is to foster the development of a broad understanding of the nature of that discrimination, which currently is much less         overt and much less conscious than in previous decades, and which continues to be bound up with negative stereotypes.  Once we as a community have this understanding, the next step is to develop         and implement strategies to address the conditions that allow discrimination to exist.         Achieving Diversity          As a significant aspect of work to maintain and to elevate our university’s stature, we must strive to foster the inclusion necessary to build an exemplary scholarly community.  Toward that         end, a sentence from the Sonoma State University Diversity Vision Statement resonates with us on this aim ( http://www.sonoma.edu/diversity/ ):         We stand committed to fostering and sustaining a pluralistic, inclusive environment that empowers all members of the campus community to achieve their highest potential without fear of prejudice         or discrimination.         Quite naturally, all of the groups that are protected by law and policy from discrimination would be included also in the focus on achieving diversity.  We believe, however, that the focus on achieving         diversity should be expanded to include deliberation on whether and how to broaden our working definition of diversity beyond these groups.           We find the delineation of four dimensions of diversity outlined in  Assessing Campus Diversity Initiatives: A guide for Campus Practitioners   by Mildred Garcia, et.al. (2001) to         be compelling.  We believe the dimensions could be helpful for organizing our diversity definition and provide a framework for a focus on supporting diversity.  They are 1) access and success,         2) campus climate and intergroup relations, 3) education and scholarship, and 4) institutional viability and vitality.  This sort of framework could allow for continuing attention to representation,         to discrimination, and to scholarly excellence.  In addition, it seems to fit well with the themes that President Gee has outlined as priorities.  The framework might be used as a means of structuring         the diversity focus and the dialogue process we recommend.         Consideration of each aspect of the framework would require deliberation on significant related questions.  For instance, regarding access and success, should our definition include learning styles         or economic status?  Should international students be part of our diversity plan?   Who else should be included?  How do we embrace multiple axes of diversity and identity and promote         the visibility of cross-category identity?           Focus on achieving diversity through consideration of this proposed framework would require a university wide dialogue.  Outcomes of such a dialogue would be an enhanced understanding of campus         climate and an engaged campus community.  In addition to defining diversity, the community dialogue should lead to defining diversity goals attached to each aspect of the framework and the development         of strategies to achieve those goals.           The university community should engage in a meaningful dialogue during the 2008-09 academic year on the two foci raised above.  Such a course of action will utilize resources that exist here for         increasing understanding and mobilize expertise on campus for meaningful participation in every aspect of the process.  The dialogue could take many forms including the typical vetting process we         use when we explore any major policy change.  It could also include presentations and workshops organized by academic and support units that provide intellectual and practical perspectives on diversity         (e.g., Cultural Studies, Anthropology, Public Health, Genetics, OMA, the MCC, The Women’s Place, the Offices of Disability Services, the Office on International Education, the Kirwan Institute,         and others).  Perhaps the Diversity Lecture Series and other already existing forums could be used for this dialogue as well.         The remainder of this academic year could be used to plan the year-long dialogue.         Other topics are listed below that arose from the individual meetings the Diversity Council had with vice presidents and deans during the 2006-07 academic year, and that could be included in the university-wide         dialogue:                   The accountability has been at the level of Deans.  The University Council on Diversity feels that if progress is to be made, the level of accountability has to involve all levels of administration,           most notably the chairs.           Diversity at OSU seems to be improving at a quicker pace at the lower levels than at the higher levels.  There are still many more men than women among the senior professoriate, and there are           few minorities in top administrative positions.  Continue programs designed to move faculty from underrepresented groups to administrative leadership positions.           The Office of Business and Finance and the colleges need to work together to develop better strategies for tracking the use of minority vendors.  Some units do not want to take extra steps in           locating a minority vendor.  Other units have difficulty identifying and quantifying the use of minority vendors.           There needs to be a funding initiative for research on diversity.           Benchmark for diversity in ways that the University benchmarks for other areas of excellence.  Use diversity statistics from institutions with the best diversity records as a yardstick by which           to measure our diversity efforts.             Ensure systematic efforts to retain women and minority faculty members at all levels.           Develop permanent resources for diversity through the impending Campus Campaign, to build endowments for scholarships at all levels and for research.           Incorporate diversity into the strategic planning for each academic and each support unit.           Bring the diversity structure into a stronger relationship with established governance structure of the University by articulating the role of the Senate Diversity Committee so as to incorporate the           Diversity Council.           The one group that remains most underrepresented in all areas is the Native American population.           Units need to address the paucity of staff involvement in diversity, especially since staff outnumber faculty and play a critical role in making students feel at home in the University.                      The Council also recommends that these recurring lessons about diversity should be incorporated in the implementation of the objectives in this plan:                   There is a disconnect between institutional emphasis on diversity and grass-roots emphasis on diversity.           The message that excellence and diversity are mutually constitutive needs to be reiterated as frequently as possible and in ways that are persuasive and concrete.           Even while the University is engaging in diversity activities and making some actual gains, women, minorities, members of the GLBT population, and faculty and   students with disabilities           remain skeptical that there is a “real” commitment to diversity at OSU.           Most units do not operate as if they know why it is in their best interest to be diverse.           The message of diversity needs to be more clearly articulated by senior level University administrators at every opportunity.           There needs to be more of a recognition that changes in programming do not always lead to deep structural changes.           Achieving diversity needs to become a criterion in the reward structure.  The consequences of not achieving diversity are not always clear.           There is unevenness in commitment across units.           The achievement of a goal of a truly diverse University community will require substantial investments of capital, labor, and trust.                   Appendix:  The 2007 Summary Report of the Diversity Council              Background            In October 2000 The Ohio State University adopted “The Academic Plan,” a plan designed to serve as a blueprint for building academic excellence.  One strategy that The Academic Plan detailed         as a building block to achieve its goal was to “create a diverse university community.” To integrate diversity as part of it academic mission, the University adopted a complementary plan,         The Diversity Action Plan, at the same time that it adopted The Academic Plan. To implement the Diversity Action Plan, OSU appointed its first University-wide Council on Diversity.  The Council’s         charge was to:                   Advise the President and Provost on the implementation of the University’s Diversity Action Plan;           Make recommendations that will enable the University to foster a campus climate of inclusion;           Solicit views of the University community on all aspects of diversity;            Examine specific concerns advanced by minority advocates;           Identify potential new initiatives that will advance our diversity goals; and           Report annually to the President and Provost on progress in achieving measurably greater diversity in institutional composition and the richness of the educational environment.                      Since its inception, the University Council on Diversity has written six reports, dating from February 5, 2002 through June 8, 2006 and covering the academic years  FY01 – FY06.  For         this, the seventh report, rather than an institutional unit-by-unit audit based on written reports received in response to a uniform assessment template, this report responds foremost to site visits that         the University Council on Diversity had with nearly all of the colleges and professional offices on campus. Council members centered the site visit discussions around the following questions:         The Present: The Unit’s Climate                   How are diversity efforts defined and perceived within your unit?           What barriers impede your diversity efforts, both within the unit and the University at large?                          The Past: The Unit’s Reports                   What underlying philosophy determines the type of diversity programming that your unit has engaged in over the years?           What was your most satisfying diversity effort and what made it so?                 The Future: Diversity Action Plan II                   In what directions should OSU take its future diversity efforts?           How should we measure our success?                 Procedures for Site Visits          The members of the University Council on Diversity collaborated with the Diversity Leadership Group and with past members of the University Council on Diversity to form approximately forty teams of three           persons each. These teams visited the academic departments, the OAA units, the Professional units, the Vice Presidential units, and the regional campuses. Units were given the discussion questions ahead           of time and could elect to have present at the meeting any representatives of their choosing. For the academic units, the Deans were present with their Diversity Committees, Executive Committees, and/or           programmatic leaders.  Other units convened their top administrators, and anyone charged with monitoring diversity initiatives.         All units expressed appreciation for these face-to-face dialogues and were assured that this report would not single out individual unit shortcomings, allowing for a more honest exchange of ideas.           What The Council Learned from the 2007 Site Visits :             On the definition of diversity:            There was no across-the-board definition of diversity.  As a term, “diversity” is highly contextual. Some units argued that any “richness of experience” should count as diversity,         while other units argued that the emphasis should be on targeted groups that have not had access to certain types of opportunities. Discussions thereby ranged from those who wanted to include any “diversity         of thought” to those who wanted diversity to be tied to issues of social justice.  In addition to the underrepresented groups already defined in the current Diversity Action Plan, the two additional         groups that received the most support for inclusion in a new Diversity Plan are international students and faculty and students and faculty with disabilities. Many recommend a rethinking and public discussion         of both the meaning of diversity and its value to OSU.  Since we can not do everything at once both central policy  and individual unit  practices will have to focus on subgroups,         from setting the benchmarks necessary to evaluate progress  to planning ""street level"" programming. The institution should reformulate a core meaning of diversity and work         on maintaining a dual focus on the practical and the ideal.           Site Visit Responses from the Units             OSU needs to:                     Articulate more convincingly that diversity matters and then act like it matters at all levels, including the highest level of the University.             Provide more centralized funding of diversity initiatives.            Build diversity initiatives across units.           Integrate the concept of diversity into multiple messages.            Build pathways and pipelines for diversity.                           Hire Deans who believe in the diversity efforts put forth by the University and who are willing to implement and support change.           Encourage diversity in recruitment and re-appointment of key personnel.           Make department chairs and faculty responsible for carrying out the goals and mission of the college’s diversity action plan.           Support Program Directors who have direct power and control over faculty reward systems.           Incorporate diversity as part of scholarly activities and compensation.            Develop a climate amongst faculty that they are invested in the success of all students.            Address entrenched attitudes that negatively affect recruitment and retention of women and faculty of color.           Restructure the SEI evaluation forms. Currently, no question measures diversity curricular or climate efforts (except, the broader question that asks whether the instructor treats the students fairly).           Provide fellowships for minority students that offer more than one year’s funding.  The Graduate Enrichment Scholarship is only one year and sometimes colleges and departments are unable           to provide additional years of funding for PhD students.              Increase the incentive for hiring underrepresented groups. Different incentives may work for different colleges. The current FHAP program is insufficient for the needs of STEM fields.             Establish from central funding a post-doctoral fellowship program for scholars from underrepresented groups who then might become candidates for permanent faculty positions.           Recognize that minority students, staff and faculty members vary in their needs.                      Note that the aforementioned action steps do not always specify  how  to accomplish the initiative or recommendation.  This has been the challenge: What is the best way to implement a particular         goal?          The following overarching observations gleaned by the University Council on Diversity from the 2000-2006 cumulative reports were fully supported by the discussions in the site visits:          What the Council Learned from Reports from 2000-2007 :                   The accountability has been at the level of Deans.  The University Council on Diversity feels that if progress is to be made, the level of accountability has to involve all levels of administration,           most notably the chairs.           There is a disconnect between institutional emphasis on diversity and grass-roots emphasis on diversity.            The message that excellence and diversity are mutually constitutive needs to be reiterated as frequently as possible and in ways that are persuasive and concrete.           Even as the University is engaging in diversity activities and making some actual gains, women, minorities, members of the GLBT population, and faculty and students with disabilities remain skeptical           that there is a      “real” commitment to diversity at OSU.           Diversity at OSU seems to be improving at a quicker pace at the lower levels than at the higher levels. There are still many more men than women among the senior professoriate, and there are few minorities           in top administrative positions. Continue programs designed to move faculty from underrepresented groups to administrative leadership positions.            The Office of Business and Finance and the colleges need to work together to develop better strategies for tracking the use of minority vendors.  Some units do not want to take extra steps in           locating a minority vendor. Other units have difficulty identifying and quantifying the use of minority vendors.           Most units still do not operate as if they know why it is in their best interest to be diverse.                           The one group that remains most underrepresented in all areas is the Native American population.              The message of diversity needs to be more clearly articulated by senior level University administrators at every opportunity.           There needs to be a funding initiative for research on diversity.           There needs to be more of a recognition that changes in programming do not always lead to deep structural changes.           Achieving diversity needs to become a criterion in the award structure.  The consequences of not achieving diversity are not always clear.           Units need to address the paucity of staff involvement in diversity, especially since staff outnumber faculty and play a critical role in making students feel at home in the University.           There is unevenness in commitment across units.           Benchmark for diversity in ways that the University benchmarks for other areas of excellence.  Use diversity statistics from institutions with the best diversity records as a yardstick by which           to measure our diversity efforts.            The achievement of a goal of a truly diverse University community will require substantial investments of capital, labor, and trust.                 At the end of seven years, 2000-2007, nearly all units of the University now have a Diversity Council at the college and/or departmental level.  While these diversity committees have done much to         increase programming about diversity, they also have created a need for better communication and organization.            Units have come to expect accountability in terms of diversity efforts.  Over time, most units progressed from perfunctory reporting to substantive, honest reporting.  A critical step in the         process has been the participation of the Executive Vice President and Provost and the President. These top administrators received reports from the Council that they had on hand when meeting annually         with each Dean.  There have been cases where Deans have had to change their posture or unit activities, given reports from the Council. Some units have made remarkable progress in terms of their         demographics.           In sum, as E. Gordon Gee has remarked, The Ohio State University is well positioned to move from “excellence to eminence.”  If it plans to do so within the context and demands of a multicultural         society, it will have to move from the mere programming of diversity and the casual rhetoric of diversity to embracing diversity as a core value—deeply rooted in the University’s culture,       community, and character.

clueweb09-enwp03-13-03357	"                     SAT Subject Tests          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  SATII )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search            The  SAT Subject Tests  is the collective name for 20  multiple choice   standardized tests  given on individual subjects. A student typically chooses which tests to take depending upon  college  entrance requirements for the schools in which he or she is planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as  Achievement Tests , and until January 2005, they were known as  SAT IIs ; they are still commonly known by these names. Every test is now a one-hour timed test. Historically, the exception to the one-hour time was the writing test, which was divided into a 20-minute  essay  question and a 40-minute multiple choice section; it was discontinued after January 2005.   A student may take up to three SAT Subject Tests on any given date. Most SAT subject tests are offered on the same dates as the regular  SAT , except for the March administration. The language tests with listening are generally available only once a year, in November. A calendar of test dates and registration deadlines can be found on  The College Board 's official website ( here ).

[ edit ]   Scoring and admissions   Each individual test is scored on a scale of 200 to 800; however, some of the tests are scored on such generous curves that it is impossible to get a 200; for example, on the Mathematics Level 2 test if someone gets every question wrong, he/she gets a score of about 310 depending on the version of the test. [ 4 ]  The one and only exception was the ELPT, which was scored on a scale of 901 to 999.   Prior to the first administration of the new SAT (which includes the writing section) in March 2005, some highly selective colleges required applicants to take three SAT Subject tests, including the writing test and two other tests of the applicant's choosing, in addition to the SAT. However, with writing now a standard component of the SAT I, most selective colleges recommend applicants to submit scores for any two SAT Subject tests. Engineering schools typically require Chemistry or Physics and prefer Math Level 2. A handful of the most competitive schools, such as  Harvard University  and  Princeton University , [ 5 ]  still require three Subject tests in addition to the three sections of the SAT. It is important to consult the school's website to find out more information about Subject test requirements.   Schools also vary with regard to their SAT Subject test requirements of students submitting scores for the  ACT  in place of the SAT: some schools consider the ACT an alternative to both the SAT and some SAT Subject tests, whereas others accept the ACT but require SAT Subject tests as well. Information about a school's specific test requirements can typically be found on its official website.   The College Board will send all scores on all SAT tests taken, including Subject Tests, whenever a student requests scores be sent to a school; the student cannot select which Subject Tests to send to a given institution.   In October 2002, the College Board decided to drop the ""score choice"" option for exams. They figured that it benefited wealthier students taking the exam who could afford to take it multiple times. Score choice means that scores are not released to colleges until the student approves the score (after seeing it).  [ 6 ]   As of the March 2009 test, test takers now have the ability to choose whether or not to send scores thus reinstating the ""score choice"" option.  [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Answer sheet   The answer sheet has room for 115 answers. 1-100 are Standard Multiple choice questions and 101-115 for 'relationship analysis questions', which are only used for the Chemistry exam. No test has more than 95 questions. The biology test is the only test to use 96-100; questions 1-60 are common to both the E and M tests, in addition, the E uses 61-80, and the M uses 81-100.

Faced with the baffling complexity   of human thought, we look for ""objective"" methods in hopes of a   direct route to its assessment. No one would presume   to describe a student's mind in a single sentence; but we are confident   that a number can say it all. Every year, 1.7 million students subject   themselves to the Scholastic Aptitude Test at the request of college admissions   officers looking for just such a short cut ( Milwaukee Journal ).   Faced with a diverse array of applicants, 92% of American colleges require   SAT scores on the assumption that they provide a method of equating students   with differing academic backgrounds but identical grade point averages   ( Hartnett & Feldmesser 4 ).   Educational Testing Service (ETS), which produces the SAT and four other   entrance exams 1 , claims that the test measures   not just how capably individuals answer analogy   and geometry questions, but how capably they will perform in the academic   world. A review of the literature tells a different story. The SAT is not   a measure of how successful one will be in college, but how well one conforms   to the demographics of the group that did well on the first exam.    About the Test    The original SAT was offered in 1926. The format was much the same then as   it is now: two 30-minute ""verbal"" sections on ""vocabulary,   verbal reasoning, and reading comprehension;"" two 30-minute ""math""   sections on ""arithmetic, algebra, and geometry;"" and an additional 30-minute   ""experimental"" section (verbal or math) used to equate the exam with previous versions   of itself and to pre-test questions that might appear on future   exams 2  ( CEEB; 1991: 3 ).   The experimental section is not identified on the test and does not count   towards a candidate's score. Scores range in value from 200 to 800 points   for both the math and verbal sections. Between 1926 and 1941, the scores   were readjusted to produce an average of 500 points. All versions of the   test subsequent to 1941 are equated to one another using the experimental   section. The first SAT was developed by Carl Campbell Brigham for the College   Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) who had previously participated in the   development of the ""Army-Alpha"" intelligence tests. The College Board,   the Carnegie Foundation, and the   American Council on Education  all of which still exist  consolidated   their standardized testing programs under the Educational Testing Service   in 1947 (adapted from  Owen  and  Nairn ).    Validity    Statistics    Colleges derive predictions of applicants' performance from regression equations   based on the performance of the previous year's students. The ability to   predict freshman grades is the backbone of the SAT's claim to measure aptitude.   In the world of psychometrics, the valid aptitude test is one that can   predict a person's performance. A perfect prediction would be 100% accurate.   A physical measurement, such as that provided by a thermometer or a ruler,   generally delivers accuracy of 95% or more. The SAT, according to figures   compiled by Ford and Campos of ETS, ranges in accuracy from 8 to 15% in   the prediction of freshman grade point average 3    ( 11 ). This means that, on the average, for 88% of the applicants (though it   is impossible to know which ones) an SAT score will predict their grade   rank no more accurately than a pair of dice. The best known record of prediction   by the SAT, reported in a 1978 ETS survey of studies, was at a New Jersey   college where the 1978 SAT-Verbal would have been matched as a predictor   by random chance only 59% of the time. The worst result was reported at   a university in Indiana where chance would have predicted grades as well   as the 1972 SAT-Verbal 99.96% of the time   ( Breland & Minsky 149, 153 ).    As dismal as these self-reported results are, the actual results are lower   still. ETS has been known to take liberties with correlation coefficients   for use in defending the SAT. Slack and Porter, in a 1980  Harvard Educational   Review  article, showed that Ford and Campos consistently misreported validity   calculations in an apparent effort to make the SAT look better. Ford and   Campos found average predictive accuracies of 16% for SAT-Verbal, 12% for   SAT-Math, and 25% for high school record ( 11 ). But when   Slack and Porter redid the arithmetic they found actual values   of 14%, 10%, and 27% respectively ( 165 ). The errors were   quite systematic, and always in favor of the SAT. Previous   grades are thus about twice as good as the SAT at predicting academic achievement.    Although the SAT is an inferior predictor relative to high school grades,   it can increase the accuracy of prediction when used in combination with   them. This has been the main justification for requiring the tests for   admissions. Data from several validity studies, however, indicate that   inclusion of SAT scores improves prediction by an average of only 5% or   less ( Nairn 66 ). The major reason that the   benefits are so low is that the SAT provides   redundant information. Gottfredson and Crouse argued that at least 90%   of the decisions to admit or reject a student are the same whether the   SAT is used in conjunction with high school rank or not. ""SAT scores   and high school rank,"" they said, ""are moderately correlated   with each other [from 0.4 to 0.5] so that outcomes   predicted from high school rank alone have a part-whole correlation of   at least 0.8 with outcomes predicted from rank plus SAT"" ( 368 ).    Marginal as they are, the predictions of first year grades are the test's   most accurate forecasts. Correlations between scores and grades in later   years, and overall college average, are lower still. One study found that   the ability of college admission tests to predict grades declined consistently   from one semester to the next throughout eight semesters ( Humphreys ).   The virtual disappearance of the aptitude tests' ability to predict beyond   the freshman year has been explained by some commentators as a result of   the nature of advanced study. Multiple choice testing predominates introductory   courses, they argue, but intermediate and advanced courses demand a broader   range of performance.    An even better standard of scholastic success is staying in school. Alexander   W. Astin suggested that:        In a very practical sense, the student's ability to stay in college is a     more appropriate measure of his success than is his freshman GPA. Although     it is true that good grades will help him gain admission to graduate     school, to win graduate fellowships, and even to secure certain types     of jobs, they are irrelevant to any of these outcomes if the student     drops out of college before completing his degree requirements ( 14-15 ).      Astin found that using SAT scores to predict who will graduate resulted in   3.2% of perfect prediction for men and 2.9% for women ( 17-18 ).   This means that for over 95% of the cases, random selection would predict   the odds of remaining in school as well as the SAT. ""Whether or not the student   will drop out of college after the freshman year,"" Astin noted, ""can be   predicted with only a low degree of accuracy"" ( 20 ).    Crouse and Trusheim, in their book  The Case Against the SAT , conducted the most detailed statistical analysis of the SAT's predictive   shortcomings. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study (NLS) of   the high school class of 1972, they calculated the number of additional   correct admissions using high school rank (HSR) alone and with the SAT.   With four different measures of undergraduate success, they calculated   that using the SAT in admissions adds between 0.1 and 2.7 additional correct   forecasts per 100 applicants (see Table 1).              Table 1:       Additional Admissions Correctly Forecasted Compared to Random Selection per 100 Applicants ( adapted from Crouse & Trusheim 54-56 )               Test       Freshman Year with       Bachelors Degree with               GPA > 2.5       GPA > 3.0       GPA > 2.5       GPA > 3.0               HSR alone       9.2       14.0       6.1       5.9               HSR + SAT       11.9       16.2       6.2       6.1               Difference       2.7       2.2       0.1       0.2          Statistics on test scores and college success, however, can never reveal   what might have been. In a rare practical experiment Williams College admitted   358 students, ten percent of each year's new admissions, over a ten year   period who would otherwise have been rejected by the school's normal test   score and grade requirements. The identities of the ""ten percenters""   were kept secret from faculty and students. They were subjected to the same   academic requirements as other students and received no special aid. In   1976 the results were announced  71% of the ""ten percenters"" graduated,   compared with the school average of 85%. In one graduating class,   the class president, president of the college council, and the president   of the honor society were all ""ten percenters""   ( New York Times ).    Predictors That Are Better Than the SAT    The qualities students need to succeed over the long haul were examined in   a 1972 study of over 300 professors by ETS psychologist Jonathan R. Warre.   His findings were as follows:        What does it take to succeed in college? Motivation was the quality most     frequently cited by over 3400 college teachers during a recent study     of academic performance. The teachers mentioned students' academic commitment     and interest even more often than intellectual ability as characteristics     of their best students ( qtd in Nairn 71 ).      Similarly, a study by the American College Testing Program reported that    ""variables such as motivation and a student's background"" discriminated    between average students and those who dropped out of college,   while academic data such as SAT scores and College Board Achievement Tests,   did not discriminate between these groups ( Nicholson ).   In general, the best predictors of creative output in adulthood are participation   during youth in independent, ""self-sustaining"" ventures   ( Joekel 6 ). According to research summarized by ETS in   1979, ""the best predictor of accomplishment in college"" is not the SAT   but ""accomplishment in the same area in high school, as measured by simple check   lists of nonacademic achievements"" ( Baird qtd in Nairn 77 ).    In a truly bizarre experiment sponsored by ETS, Dr. John R. P. French of   the University of Michigan reported high correlations of ""achievement   orientation"" with uric acid levels in the blood (0.66). According to Dr. French:        [We] were able to predict four and a half years in advance which high school     students would go on to college and which would not. We were also able     to predict which ones would drop out of college, and if we took into     account IQ, how long before they dropped out.... We hope to do some studies     of serum uric acid in the selection of executives ( 31 ).      Considering the SAT's poor predictive ability, one has to wonder exactly   what takes priority at ETS. Such criticisms are not isolated. A former   ETS executive once described the company as ""an educational country club   [designed to] pamper over-priced researchers   who sit all day and contemplate their psychometric navels 4 ""   ( Owen 8 ).    There Is No Correct Answer    To get an idea of what ETS really thinks about the accuracy of the SAT, consider   its principle method of detecting cheating. ETS' scoring machines are programmed   to set aside the answer sheets of students who score suspiciously higher   or lower in taking the SAT for the second time. In order to set off the   machines, there has to be a 150 point difference on either half of the   test or a 250 point combined difference between the first and the second   times a test is taken ( Milwaukee Journal ).   When a paper is set aside, ETS investigators check for inconsistencies   in handwriting or signatures and can recreate the seating arrangements   to look for indications of collaboration or spying. In most cases cheating   is not found and the results are allowed to stand. If this isn't cheating   then what is? Does ETS think that scholastic aptitude is so volatile that   it can grow or shrink 25% in three months 5 ? If   aptitude was really an innate, unlearnable thing and if the SAT really   measured it, then any change over 34 points  the SAT's standard error   of measurement  should be suspect ( CEEB; 1965: 21 ).    That ETS would allow such a wide variance is, to me, an indication of the   exam's misguided construction. The SAT is not built from content specifications   or on a model of human reasoning, but rather from statistical guidelines.   This results in a circular reasoning where the right answer is the one   that the students who perform best on the test chose most. Questions are   designed solely on their ability to discriminate high scorers from low   ones. When new questions are written they are ""pretested"" to see   if they conform to these requirements. A different thirty minute   section of each SAT consists of untried questions that don't count towards   the test-taker's score. How students respond to these items determine whether   or not they will be used on real SATs. An item writer for ETS explained   the process:        It was all very pragmatic. It wasn't... theoretical or anything. I had always     known this to be true, but it had never been presented to me with such     force. There is no Platonic correct answer to any of these questions;     it's all determined by the statistical performance of the question as     it relates to other questions. If students who do well on the exam generally     tend to pick the same answer then it must be pretty good ( Owen 79 ).      Coachability    The Little Green Book That Lies    It's interesting to note that when the first SAT was administered, the idea   of multiple choice testing was almost unknown in American schools. Many   of the students who took the test were hesitant to guess when they weren't   certain of an answer. ""They felt that guessing was not only risky but even immoral, equating it   with cheating"" ( Owen 93 ). This led one ETS researcher to suggest that students should learn ""how to behave effectively when taking a test"" ( qtd in Nairn 95 ). If one could be taught effective test taking might it not also be possible   to teach superior test taking? The official line at ETS was no.    In 1976, the Federal Trade Commission responded to ETS' long standing wish   for a government investigation of the coaching schools. Their claim was   that the aptitude the SAT measured was acquired over years  promises   of significant results (over 100 points) in six weeks were false advertising.   In  Effects of Coaching on Scholastic Aptitude Test Scores  the College Board reported that:        Despite variable factors from one study to another, the net result across     all studies is that score gains directly attributable to coaching amount,     on the average, to fewer than 10 points  a difference of such small     magnitude... that it is unreasonable to expect it to affect college admissions     decisions. The magnitude of the gains resulting from coaching vary slightly,     but they are always small regardless of the coaching method used or the     differences in the students coached ( 4 ).      Unfortunately for ETS, the plan backfired. The test preparation schools were   not cited with fraudulent advertising  ETS was. The initial FTC report   found that coaching courses, on the average, raised scores more than 100   points on both the verbal and math sections 6    ( Nairn 102 ). ""Contrary to [the] explicit claims   of ETS/CEEB,"" said Albert Kramer Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection,   ""coaching can be effective..."" ( Levine 5 ).    How ETS got into this situation is beyond me. The original 1968 report,     Effects of Coaching on Scholastic Aptitude Test   Scores , had become known within the company as ""The Little Green Book That   Lies"" ( Owen 89 ). By the time of the investigation, it   had been known for four years that   the math portion was vulnerable to coaching ( Pike & Evans ).   In 1978, Lewis W. Pike of ETS summarized the results of previous coaching   studies  including several that ETS had neglected to cite in its earlier   summaries. Published in 1978, he concluded that the SAT-Math was clearly   coachable and that the SAT-Verbal probably was, but that no comprehensive   study of the latter had been attempted ( Pike ).   A few weeks later, Lewis Pike was fired. The following year, the College   Board issued a new official statement on coaching, published under this   headline: ""Board reaffirms its position that 'coaching' for SAT is not likely to improve   students' scores"" ( Owen 100 ). One really has   to doubt the objectivity of ETS in assessing its own products.    How to Beat the Test    In order for a test question to make it onto a real SAT it has to have certain   statistical characteristics. A question is used only if high scoring students   tend to get it right and low scoring students tend to get it wrong. If   low scoring students do as well as high scoring students, then the question   will have an unacceptably low discrimination, and ETS will either have   to rewrite it or discard it. The key to a successful test preparation course   lies in its ability to address the circular logic in writing questions   on a statistical foundation. David Owen, in his book  None of the Above ,   describes just one such coaching school: The Princeton Review. In their   method, test candidates are taught how to recognize the incorrect alternatives   to a question. As Owen reported:        Adam Robinson [one of Princeton Review's founders] calls this average test     taker Joe Bloggs. When Joe Bloggs takes the SAT, he scores 450. When     ETS lays a trap for him, he steps in it. Princeton Review students learn     how to avoid these traps by learning to understand how Joe Bloggs thinks.     When Princeton Review students come to a hard question they don't understand,     they ask themselves: What would Joe do here? Then they do something else     ( 124 ).      Owen's reported average score increases for Princeton Review students were   185 points on either portion of the SAT. Roughly 30% of the students experienced   gains in excess of 250 points ( 122 ).    At Princeton Review, candidates are also taught how to find the experimental   section. Since it doesn't count towards the final score, they fill it out   at random and save themselves the trouble 7 0.   This effectively sabotages the SAT's statistics on future versions of   the exam. When they answer the questions at random, they reduce the difficulty   of future SATs by making the pretest questions look harder than they are.   Remarked John Katzman, another founder of Princeton Review, ""The SAT   is bullshit"" ( Owen 140 ).    Biases    The triumph of Princeton Review over the SAT reveals an inherent problem   with a test based on a statistical model. If the psychometricians can't   define what aptitude is  outside of saying that apt people have it    what exactly are they measuring? It might pay to examine some of the characteristics   of the people ETS identifies as less apt.    Income    If the SAT is an extremely weak predictor of academic potential it is a moderate   predictor of family income. Average scores are proportional to family income:   students from families with higher incomes tend to receive higher   scores 8 0. Estimates of the correlation between   SAT score and family income vary   from 0.23 to 0.40 ( Crouse & Trusheim  and    Doermann , respectively). This ranking by income   prevails not just when large groups   are averaged together but also among applicants within the same institution.    A table from Crouse & Trusheim's book  The Case Against   the SAT  (reprinted below) indicates that SAT scores differentiate people not only   by income but also by their parents' role in the economic system. The average   scores of the children of professionals are higher than the children of   white collar workers, which in turn, are higher than the children of blue   collar workers. High school rank, which is a better measure of academic   achievement than SAT scores, shows no such correlation.              Table 2:       Correlations of SAT and High School Rank (HSR) with Socioeconomic Background ( Crouse & Trusheim 126 )               Test       Family Income       Father's Occupation       Father's Education       Mother's Education               SAT       0.286       0.238       0.296       0.269               HSR       0.029       0.043       0.085       0.067          If SAT scores really measure a person's scholastic aptitude, then that aptitude   is distributed according to parental income.    Some have used such studies to indicate the academic superiority of the upper   classes. Further investigation reveals the folly of such assumptions. An   American Council on Education study of 36,581 students in 55 colleges concluded   that: ""The income of a student's parents has no relationship to freshman GPA, either   before of after controlling for high school grades, academic aptitude,   and college selectivity"" ( Astin; 1971: 14 ).   Similarly, an ETS study of 15,535 college bound students found that actual   accomplishments outside the classroom did not correlate with income either:        Although educational ambitions were significantly related to accomplishments     in several areas, family income was not [one of them]. That is, students     from families with different incomes did not significantly differ in     the number or level of accomplishments they reported ( 23 ).      Not only do the children of the wealthy score unusually high on the SAT,   they also have, by virtue of their wealth, increased access to test preparation   materials and coaching schools  tuition for the Princeton Review course   was $500 in 1984. The FTC investigation found that those candidates who   had taken advantage of coaching were heavily concentrated in the upper   income brackets: In 1978, 41% of the coached students came from the top   income bracket of $30,000 or more ( Levine qtd in Nairn 98 ).   As Owen said of Princeton Review students, ""[They] simply don't take the same   test.... The effect would be the same if   ETS randomly selected a thousand white, wealthy students each year, gave   them the answers to the SAT in advance, and then denied that it had done   so"" ( 139 ).    Race    In addition to its socioeconomic bias, the SAT is also prejudiced against   non-whites. For example:        An ETS study of students at integrated colleges found that, in the six schools     for which the information was available, ""while SAT score means for blacks    were lower than those for their white counterparts,     their mean high school ranks were higher"" ( Davis & Temp 2 ).    An extensive study by Alexander Astin found that ""dropout rates of black   students attending white colleges... are slightly     lower than is predicted from grades and test scores"" ( Astin; 1970: 92 ).    Goldman and Widawski in a study of four University of California institutions     reported that ""blacks and Chicanos are clearly not benefited by the use of the SAT in selection     of college students  at least at the institutions we have investigated.     In every instance, far fewer black and Chicano students would be selected     when the SAT is used than when it is not"" ( 196 ).    Use of the SAT at the four universities would make inadmissible 12-15%     of the Chicano and 14-43% of the black applicants who would have been     admitted on the basis of high school GPA ( 192-3 ).     ETS' reply to such claims  some of them from their own researchers  is   that the SAT does not discriminate against particular groups per se, but   rather that it reflects the fundamental inequality of American society.   The SAT is no more responsible for these inequalities than a thermometer   is responsible for a fever. It is one thing to use test scores to illuminate   disparity, but it is something else entirely to restrict opportunities   with them. The real crime of the SAT is that it disguises this disparity   as a morally neutral difference in aptitude. Daniel Seligman, associate   managing editor of  Fortune  magazine, had this to say on the subject:        ETS tests persist in showing some people to be smarter than others. And if     some people are smarter than others, there might actually be some justification     for an economic system in which some people have more money and authority     than others.... The really interesting question is not whether rich people     are smarter, but why they are. Is it because of their superior environments     or their superior genes? The answer... is 'both, obviously' ( 84 ).      Wealthy whites don't see SAT results as proof that the poor are mistreated,   they see them as proof that mistreatment of the poor is fair.    Implications    A Word About Test Score Decline    The decline of test scores with age has long been a feature of standardized   aptitude and intelligence tests. The American College Testing Program openly   admitted the age discrimination in its college admissions test: ""Age   groups are combined for prediction [by ACT scores]; however, this procedure   leads to consistent underprediction of the grades of older students, and   thus to bias against them"" ( ACT 23 ). If claims   about what these tests measure are taken at face value, they   show that adults decline in aptitude as soon as they pass their early twenties.   If we buy into the whole notion that the SAT measures ""verbal and   mathematical abilities... developed over many years both in and   out of school"" then on the average most people lose ability shortly   after high school ( CEEB; 1991: 3 ). What's   really happening, however, is that as the test taker advances in   the performance and skill-oriented job world he moves farther and farther   away from the test-oriented school world. The tendency of aptitude tests   to penalize people without recent practice in test-taking skills has its   greatest impact on candidates returning to school after several years in   the job market. Those who weren't able to go on to higher education immediately   out of high school, displaced workers looking for additional education,   and homemakers returning to school are all penalized.    A lot of press over the last 20 years has been devoted to the consistent   decline in average SAT scores beginning in 1963 and their miraculous turnaround   in 1982. Every SAT since has been normed against the test administered   in April 1941. Whatever else has changed in the world, the SAT remains,   according to a College Board publication, an ""unchanging standard""   ( Advisory Panel 8 ). Various reasons have been proposed  from increased electives and ""diminished seriousness"" to television and fluoride in drinking water  but none of them are based   on a test-oriented model 9    ( Advisory Panel 46-48 ). Given that the test   is a better predictor of status quo demographics than   of scholastic aptitude I would imagine that any statistically significant   changes are directly attributable to demographic changes in the population   of students that take the test. In much the same manner that scores decline   with age, they decline as the demographics of the test-takers move away   from the white, Anglo-Saxon, upper class norm of 1941 and towards a multiethnic,   economically heterogeneous sample.    Hope Will Be Kept Within Reasonable Bounds    Carl Campbell Brigham, the creator of the first SAT, was a firm believer   in tying advancement and opportunity to ""merit."" Unfortunately,   he was also a bigot. His only book,  A Study of American Intelligence , ""proved"", through army intelligence  statistics that Catholics, Greeks, Hungarians, Italians, Jews, Poles, Russians, Turks and  especially  Negroes were innately less intelligent than Germanic and Scandinavian peoples. ""We...  face here,"" he wrote, ""a possibility of racial admixture here that is infinitely worse than that faced by any European country today for we are incorporating the Negro into our racial stock, while all of Europe is comparatively free from this taint""  ( 209 ). By carefully sampling the mental power of the nation's young people, he hoped to identify and reward those citizens whose racial inheritance had granted them superior intellectual powers. The SAT was to be the currency of merit in a new American social order based on an aristocracy of aptitude  or meritocracy.    Henry Chauncey, founder and first president of ETS, inherited the meritocratic   ideal and continued to preach its virtues:        To many the prospect of measuring in quantitative terms what have previously     been considered intangible qualities is frightening, if not downright     objectionable. Yet, I venture to predict that we will become accustomed     to it and find ourselves better off for it. In no instance that I can     think of has the advance of accurate knowledge been detrimental to society....     Educational and vocational guidance, personal and social adjustment most     certainly should be greatly benefited. Life may have less mystery but     it will also have less disillusionment and disappointment. Hope will     not be a lost source of strength, but it will be kept within reasonable     bounds ( qtd in Nairn 4 ).      The Scholastic Aptitude Test is a clever attempt to conceal aristocracy and   racism behind the cover of science and objectivity. Students, parents,   teachers, and administrators who submit themselves to the SAT and believe   the lies that ETS tells them are not acting in their own best interest.   The SAT is a tool for the privileged to maintain the status quo. Like the   razor wire surrounding a gated community, the ""reasonable bounds""   of the SAT serve to isolate the well-to-do from the rest of society and   ensure that the wealthy and powerful are the only ones with access to the   wealth and power.

Intelligence test scores among racial and socio-economic segments of American     society are not growing ever wider, contrary to arguments in  The Bell Curve , but are, in fact, converging, say Cornell University psychologists Wendy     M. Williams and Stephen J. Ceci, based on analyses of national data sets     of mental test scores.

SAT is now an acronym for Scholastic Assessment Test. The name change had been in effect since March 1994.  If we can be of further assistance, please contact us.      Well you wouldn't know it from reading any ETS publications. They seem ashamed   to admit what it is they actually measure with their products ( see footnote 9 ).    2/96 Steve Jobs: The Voice of Underrepresented Millionaires    Quote from an interview with Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple computers.        It's a political problem. The problems are sociopolitical. The problems are     unions. You plot the growth of the NEA [National Education Association]     and the dropping of SAT scores, and they're inversely proportional. The     problems are unions in the schools. The problem is bureaucracy. I'm one     of these people who believes the best thing we could ever do is go to     the full voucher system.    I have a 17-year-old daughter who went to a private school for a few years     before high school. This private school is the best school I've seen     in my life. It was judged one of the 100 best schools in America. It     was phenomenal. The tuition was $5,500 a year, which is a lot of money     for most parents. But the teachers were paid less than public school     teachers  so it's not about money at the teacher level. I asked the     state treasurer that year what California pays on average to send kids     to school, and I believe it was $4,400. While there are not many parents     who could come up with $5,500 a year, there are many who could come up     with $1,000 a year.    If we gave vouchers to parents for $4,400 a year, schools would be starting     right and left. People would get out of college and say, ""Let's start a    school."" You could have a track at Stanford within the MBA program on how to be the     businessperson of a school. And that MBA would get together with somebody     else, and they'd start schools. And you'd have these young, idealistic     people starting schools, working for pennies.    They'd do it because they'd be able to set the curriculum. When you have     kids you think, What exactly do I want them to learn? Most of the stuff     they study in school is completely useless. But some incredibly valuable     things you don't learn until you're older  yet you could learn them     when you're younger. And you start to think, What would I do if I set     a curriculum for a school?    God, how exciting that could be! But you can't do it today. You'd be crazy     to work in a school today. You don't get to do what you want. You don't     get to pick your books, your curriculum. You get to teach one narrow     specialization. Who would ever want to do that? ( Wired . February 1996: 158.)      How exciting indeed! You're right Steve, I am paid too much. I can't wait   to start working for pennies. I feel so deprived teaching only one narrow   specialization. Throw some more work my way. Unions? They just get in the   way, don't they. All these teachers with more education than you demanding   reasonable salaries and decent working conditions. The temerity! Send a   couple of MBAs our way, Steve. We need their leadership and insightful   knowledge. How did I ever manage to teach without a Stanford grad manning   the whip? Thank you, Steve. Thank you for solving our nation's educational   problems. Please excuse my tears of joy.       Endnotes        These are the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test/National Merit Scholarship     Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT), the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), the     Graduate Record Exam (GRE), and the Graduate Management Admission Test     (GMAT).    Another section, the Test of Standard Written English (TSWE), was recently     added to the SAT test battery. Since it is fairly new, I had trouble     finding enough material from which to draw conclusions. As I do not know     how this exam is used, I will not consider it in this paper.    The statistic used in this report for describing the accuracy of a predictor     is what Nairn calls the ""percentage of perfect prediction."" It is the ""improvement    in accuracy of prediction over prediction by chance"" and is calculated by taking the square    of the correlation coefficient (r 2 ) and multiplying by 100% ( 416 ).    It is estimated that only 6.5% of the $17.00 test fee actually goes toward     test development. This leaves ETS, a tax-exempt corporation, with     a lot of money to burn; some of it on what one researcher called ""stupid or crazy""    research activities ( qtd in Owen 235 ).    The SAT is offered seven times a year during the regular academic calendar     of most schools. Realistically speaking this is the shortest time possible     between two exams allowing for scoring and entrance deadlines.    These figures were for the students who had already enrolled in a test preparation     course. Since family income and SAT scores are slightly correlated and     test preparation fees attract students from upper income brackets in     disproportionately high numbers they do not represent the across-the-board     gains expected. Were all the SAT candidates to enroll in a coaching school,     the actual increases would average 25 points ( Levine 5 ).    When Owen took the exam he found the experimental section and filled      it out ""in a handsome zigzag pattern"" ( Owen 151 ).    This pattern has been detected in several studies among them: Admissions     Testing 1975,  Ramist & Arbeiter ,  Doermann ,    and  Crouse & Trusheim .    One reason for this might be that those researchers who don't buy into the     structural theories  like the ""disintegration"" of the    American family that we hear so much about  probably agree with     John Katzman that ""the SAT is bullshit."" Another study    of the SAT would likely draw more attention to the exam than     to itself and thus defeat its purpose. Alan Nairn's original work on     the test, before the Nader report, is nearly 20 years old and yet we     hear more talk of standardized testing than ever before. The SAT is still     around and the NTE (which presumably stands for the National Teacher     Exam although its  Bulletin of Information  never explicitly states this)     is fast becoming the next cure for our educational ""ills.""

The     purpose of this program is to expand and enhance Korean language education     in  America      by providing stipend for graduate teaching assistants (TA) in those     institutions which cannot afford to hire regular instructors to offer     Korean language courses. The funding priority will be given to those     institutions which:                   1) Want to develop a new Korean language program from the scratch, or to     upgrade an existing tutorial/self-instructional/critical language program     to a regular program            2) Need an extra instructor to expand Korean language course offerings            3) Cannot afford to provide a drill instructor for a faculty such that the     faculty is overloaded with too many teaching hours            4) Want to create separate tracks between heritage and non-heritage     students.             The funding is initially for one year with the possibility of renewal for     the second year pending the evidence of the effectiveness and promise of     the program. The application should be submitted by a faculty who is in     charge or support of Korean language program. The application material     should include an application letter along with the application form in the     attachment, as well as an endorsement letter from the head of the academic     unit in which the Korean language program is housed. All application     material should be submitted electronically to Prof. Hyo Sang Lee, the     Executive Secretary ( korean@indiana.edu )                 The application deadline is March 1. The application will be reviewed by     the evaluation committee which consist of AATK officers and some executive     board members, and the evaluation result will be notified by March 15.

Our GMAT test course is heavily focused on ""self-help."" Here's why:  A) If you are intimately involved in both structuring and completing your GMAT test preparation, you will have a better understanding of the experience and reap better GMAT test results and  B) We recognize that there is great diversity in learning styles. By leaving the GMAT test preparation solution in a more open, relaxed format, we believe we can make the diversity in learning styles a strength rather than a weakness.  The Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) is a test that has been produced by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), and is used to help business schools in making admissions decisions. The GMAT test is taken by students who are applying for admission to either MBA or other graduate management programs. The GMAT test is given in English only, and it tests analytical writing, quantitative, and verbal skills. In the United States, the GMAT test is a computer-based test.There are several ways in which to register for the GMAT test. Registration can be completed online on the website for the GMAC or by phone by calling 1-800-717-GMAT. Registration can also be completed by mail. If registering by mail, the GMAT Appointment Scheduling form needs to be downloaded from GMAC's website, filled in, and mailed to Pearson VUE. The address to which to mail this form is indicated on the website. When registering, all necessary fees must be paid as well. If registering by phone or online, fees must be paid with a debit or a credit card. If registering by mail, fees can also be paid with a cashier's check, a personal check, or a money order. All fees must be drawn on US banks, in US dollars. Fee details are all outline on the website for the GMAC.The GMAT test consists of three sections. The first section of the test is the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA). The AWA consists of two writing tasks. The first is an analysis of an issue, and the second task is the analysis of an argument. The Analytical Writing Assessment is always found at the beginning of the GMAT test, and test takers are given 30 minutes to complete each writing task. The second section of the GMAT test is the quantitative section. This section tests the knowledge of arithmetic, elementary algebra, and common geometry through questions on data sufficiency and problem solving. There are 37 multiple choice questions in this section, and test takers have a maximum of 75 minutes to complete these questions. The third section of the GMAT test is the verbal section. This section has 41 multiple choice questions, and the questions test reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and sentence correction. There is a maximum of 75 minutes to complete this section of the examination. In addition, there will be pretest questions mixed in to these sections of the exam. These questions will not be identified as pretest questions, so it is important to answer all questions as best as possible. Pretest questions are not scored. Examples of all of the types of questions that may be seen on the GMAT test can be found online at GMAC's website.  The GMAT test is a computer adaptive test. This means that the multiple choice questions in the quantitative and verbal sections are adjusted to the ability level of the test taker. Specific details on how the computer adaptive test process works can be found online at GMAC's website. Because the computer test system will not advance to the next question without answering the current question, all questions must be answered. In cases where the answer is not known, it is therefore necessary to make an educated guess. It is also imperative that all test questions are completed. Therefore, proper pacing throughout the exam is necessary.  The verbal and quantitative sections of the GMAT test have scores that range from zero to 60. These raw scores are then converted to an overall otalscore that ranges from 200 to 800. Two thirds of all test takers will have a total score between 400 and 600. The scores in the verbal and quantitative sections are determined by several things: the number of questions answered, if the questions were answered correctly or incorrectly, and the level of difficulty of the questions answered, as well as the statistical nature of the questions. The Analytical Writing Assessment is scored by two independent essay readers. These readers score the AWA on a scale from zero to six, and the scores from each reader are averaged to come up with an overall sore. The overall score ranges from zero to six, in half point increments. If the scores from the independent readers vary by more than one point, an expert essay reader is used to help determine the final score. The score from the AWA does not impact the total score for the verbal and quantitative sections.The GMAT test covers a wide range of topics. Make sure that you are prepared for a mental marathon on the GMAT exam. A lot of test takers preparing for the GMAT exam end up spending thousands of dollars on GMAT test prep courses when they would probably be better off with a couple of GMAT test study guides and practice tests.
